<h2>About Group 42</h2> <p>

<li>Why Group 42?  And a little history. <ul> Back in early 1982
four of us used to hang out and hack on code, radios and
electronic gadgets.  We authored some of our earlier hacks
<i>Group of 4</i>. A little while later Nickle started a 24 hour
a day 300bps BBS in the 707 area code and called it <i>Group
4.</i>  In early 1984, <i>Group 4</i> had got tangled up in all
the fone codez, diskfer+catfer/send'ing warez, and hacking on
the fone systems.  With our AppleCat modems purring all night
gathering the critical warez, and with the only elite BBS in the
area, interest in <i>Group 4</i> started to grow.  This interest
became growth for Group 4.<p> Someone pointed out that Group 4
was some sort of investment company, and we no longer had just
four in our little circle, so it was time we changed our name. 
And of course 42 is/was the answer! </ul>

<li>Why the seven sided symbol? <ul> This symbol represents the
ideals of Group 42.  The bottom 4 sides are the foundation and
represent Information, Knowledge, Wisdom and Resourses.<p> The
top three sides represent the goals of Group 42 they are Power,
Progress and Freedom.  We came up with this when we all went
on a 10 day retreat with no food except what we could catch or
shoot, up in Modoc County, California.</ul>

<li>Why Sell Out?
<ul> The members of Group 42 are getting older
with ages spanning from 26 to 31. Most of us have careers and
new families to deal with now and can't afford to explore <i>the
system</i> at the levels we once did.  Especially in the light
of new laws that tend to make everything illegal, and law
enforcement that seems to only enforce laws when it deems it necessary.
So it was decided that we would package some of our information
and warez, combined it with some other critical warez and infos
that are available, and offer it to anyone who wanted it in an
easy to read and accessible format.
<p>
The net and computers are
helping make information exchange easier, they are also making
the government paranoid.  This disc seeks to preserve ideas and
information, in a very permanent form,  that governments of this
world may
soon seek to regulate if not destroy.
</ul>

<li>Is there more Group 42 information than this?
<ul>
Yes, much more.  We have made a great effort to get this disc out
by the first of January 1996.  With this time constraint we could
not convert the masses of the Group 42 archive in time for this
release.  But we do expect to do a second release of the Group 42
Information Archive before the end of 1996 that will contain the
complete Group 42 archive.
</ul>
<li>Who are Group 42's members?
<ul>

Current Members are: 

<ul type=disc>

<br>

<li><b>Nickle</b> (Founding member) - The man that holds the
group together.  Futurist philosopher and software engineer,
<b>Nickle</b> is the man who gives the group vision.  In the
beginning was he and Wheats who pushed for mutual cooperation,
cooked up scenarios for if we got caught and for what kind of
profile members would show, and instilled a realist-libertarian
outlook on life for us all.  With <b>Nickle's</b> planning and
"3-ring" binder of well thought out scenarios <b>Group 42</b>
has done, seen, and been; without getting busted.

<li><b>4x</b> (pronounced <i>four by</i>) - Our resident
Hardware Hacker, has designed many little nifty hardware
gadgets.  Working with <b>G-man</b> he has developed cable
fixes, DDI and other radio to digital interfaces, radio mods and
other grey market stuph, many of which are being sold in the back
of many US magazines right now.  Joined <b>Group 42</b> in 1986
when we were at college.

<li><b>G-man</b> (Founding member) - <b>G-man</b> is kinda jack
of all trades. He is currently working for some large company
that builds networking equiptment.  He knows the TCP/IP and IPX
protocol stack like the back of his hand, and also has alot of
experience with wireless data transmissions. He along with
<b>4X</b> have developed many interesting devices, that use or
decode Manchester datastreams, and are sold on the hacker
market today.

<li><b>Redwoods</b> (Founding member) In the old days was also
known as <b>Lord Frobo</b> and  then <b>The Rifter</b>.  Always
wanted to publish our findings to the public hacker forums to
gain a name for Group 42.  The Group let him do some limited
publishing in the early 80's under the above names.  He took
acid for the first time in 1986 and realized that his old hacker
names were lame and that publishing to gain notoriety was stupid
and dangerous to the groups activities.  Took the name
<b>Redwoods </b> when some Delta Zeta started calling him
<i>Randy of the Redwoods</i> after a co-ed retreat in the North
Western Sierras.  <b>Redwoods</b> is another one of <b>Group
42</b> that works for a large company, he develops Windows Apps.

<li><b>Codemaster</b> - Codemaster was always around in the
early days. Group 4 knew him because he was always skammin the
warez with his Applecat and was a good friend of the Red Headded
Freak (of Diskfer fame.) We didn't really let him in on much in
the older days because he was a little reckless the way he
operated.  He finally got popped by MCI for using codez from his
house.  A year or so later he had mellowed out and learned self
control and we gradually let him in on what we were doing.  He
has grown to become a great asset to <b>Group 42</b>.  He has a
great ability to weed out information on line and has developed
software to monitor, scan, log and filter the IRC and USENET,
keeping <b>Group 42</b> on top of all things that are happening
on the net.

<li><b>Clark Kent</b> - <b>Clark Kent</b> is the newest and youngest
member of <b>Group 42</b>.  He was a freshman at our almamader when the
rest of us were Juniors, Seniors or had Graduated.  He has a
sharp mind and is a knowledge freak, reading and skamming any
file, book or disc he can find.  It was <b>Clark Kent's</b> idea to blaze
the CD-ROM pulishing fronteer and HTML'ize the <b>Group 42
Information Archive</b> when we decided to <i>Sell Out.</i>

<li><b>FNF</b> (Pronounced <i>eff-in-eff</i>,Short for <b>File
Not Found</b>) -  <b>FNF</b> brought us the internet.  Back in
1985 most of us were in college studying computer science, math,
or electrical engineering.  This is where we met <b>FNF</b>. 
<b>FNF</b> was the collage USENET guru and quickly became close
friends with Group 42.  It wasn't long before FNF had hooked up
an unused PDP computer to the campus port selector giving Group
42 its own private email and news feed.  <b>FNF</b> also brought
us great quantities of Unix knowledge and later became the
system admin for the campuses AT&T computer.  Most of the Unix
cracking information is <b>FNF's</b> work.

</ul>

<p>

Previous Members were:

<ul type=disc>

<br>

<li><b>Wheats</b> (Founding member) - Stopped associating with
the members of <b>Group 42</b> a few years ago since he became a
researcher for CERT. For the longest time Wheats was our
projectile weapons expert.  We can remember the day he turned
18, with $2500 in his hand he headed down to Tri-City and bought
6 long guns including an AK-47, AR-15 HBAR, and a SPAS shotgun. 
His 21st birthday was celebrated much the same way but buying
hand-held projectile weapons.  Remembering back as a kid, those
of us that knew him and of his wacky adventures of shooting home
made cannons, rockets, and bombs; were amazed on how well they
worked and how much Wheats cared about safety.  This care for
safety and <b>Wheats</b> wise words helped temper some of the
attitudes of the members of <b>Group 42</b>, cautioning us to
lay low and explore the world without disturbing the dangers
that lie, instead of drawing attention to ourselves.  He also
helped alot of us learn how to shoot straight, to understand and
support the 2nd Amendment to our constitution,  and to respect
weapons (which was his first love); for this we owe him alot.

<li><b>Mad Max</b>- We lost track of him a while back. 
Purportedly working in Singapore now.  He was an adrenelin addict,
who coined the phrase <i><b>No Risk, No Rush</b></i>.  Part hacker,
comidian, and adventurer; Mad Max's positive outlook on life helped
bring necessary balance and insight to Group42.  He
instigated us into some crazy pranks and could always be counted
on to go to any extreme to get information. Used to hangout with
the SF Cacophony Society and occasionally brought some of the
others in <b>Group 42</b> along for the experiences. His love
for Asia and asian woman finally dragged him away a few years
after college.
