  Two months have slipped by. Prime
Anarchist Productions has moved anudda
state over. We've been invited to the
Young Communist League's annual
convention next week at Amhearst
college. Well, PAP refuses to go NEAR
another college for two whole months.
From National Student conventions, CIA-
off-campus marches, benefits for
Guatemalans, lectures, divestment sit-
ins, and the usual class attendance,
this entity is about burnt out.
  Besides, they want ten bucks to
"defray costs". That's not my idea of
communism. Plus: I dont think we
should scrap one lousy form of
government for still another lousy
form. I'd much rather work within and
without THIS one.

Actually, he was smarter than you give
hime credit for. First His Party
engineered the decrease in budget,then
when people noticed, the Great
Communucator (SATAN?) restored less
then was cut and came out looking great
while everyone else looked like crap.
The man is an embarassment!

  Reagan visited the Coast Guard
promising his full support in their
"war" against drugs.
  Last January, he cut their budget
55%, and there s   another 50% cut in
the making.

By the way:  This is the section for
discussing drugs. Here is the spot for
topics like NORML, a National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, High Times magazine,
and etc.
 Today's hot topic is "Zero tolerance
law". Reagan's most recent pet baby
project.  prime
 
  Another g00d section is "PHUD",
phreaker's underground development.

Marco,
  Can you call John D and ask him to
call my board?
  Zeshshsh
  (sysnote: to this I had to respond
that I couldn't. There is no way I can
get ahold of John Draper. <I found out
later that his fond# is public
availability-stuff these days. He
called John himself>
 
  Other things you can see online are
assorted ramblings; Political
discussion amongst all kinds of
different types of dweebs, schtuph
like that. In fact, Infomaniack even
hosts a local warboard where the yokels
can rag on each other and try to jerk
some tears out of their phellow man.
 
 (sysnote <again> I know that's kind
of violent, but it's the first warboard
New London County has seen since 1986
when the SECCC crew saw the likes of
the Crotch Patrol, Verifier's early
spatramblings, Sue's spellcasting, and
kids a "coffee house" to come chill out
agressively.

Hey all. I just got back from an
enjoyable afternoon in Leister (sp?),
Massachussets with my mom and my
cousin. We picked up Denise, and she
showed us around the campus. I got to
check out the library, (really small),
the police barracks, a 4foot by 9foot
old pump-house, and the dorms. Wow,
what a bunch of foxy freshmen and
sophomore girls.
  At any rate, there was a swap meet
going on in the next town over, held by
the local chapter of Hell's Angels,
and there was a fair going on in the
next town from that held by the
Rotarians.
  I love travelling. Seeing New
England is a really neat thing. In the
towns where my cousin's college is,
there are still those old fashioned
dugout types of things where you wait
for your bus if it's raining. Every
streetcorner had one.  Neat.

Watchin Night Flight. First time I've
seen that since about 1985. Good stuff.
They're doin an expose about the
1960's and how it's about to repeat.
 
I was talkin to A.H. the other day,
and he was discussing that very
phenomenon.
 
   "We're repeating the 60's with our
clothes, our music, our poetry, our
rallies. How come we can't start
repeating the political thought too?
That's why I'm bringing back STEAL
THIS BOOK and DANCING THRU THE ICE
AGE. If all goes well, I'll bring back
WOODSTOCK NATION too."

    -a review or two
 
"Welcome to the Jungle" -guns & roses
  The name reminds me of the old metal
era. Taking something soft; offsetting
it to something extremely hard.
  The song reminds me of the anarchy
to come in this future coming up. Are
they warning us of this summer? The
year of the Dragon? Hmmm. Or are they
just describing their tenement building
before they hit it big. Hmmm. Listen
to the lyrics; close your eyes. Name a
ghetto neighborhood near you-- they're
talkin about it.
  The metal is good, the lyrics are
good, the producing/engineering is
adequate.
 
"Fast Car" -that black chick with
knotty hair.
  The music was simple, the lyrics
straightforward, the video was
supersimple. The message is clear. Name
your favorite soup kitchen: close your
eyes.   You live there, and want out.
Need wheels?  Tune in MTV.
