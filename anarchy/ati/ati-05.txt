FREE WILLIAM WINTERHOLER
  William Winterholer has been busted
by local police for redialing the
scabline at General Dynamics. (see
enclosed story)
  They are getting him for harrassment.
Isnt it amazing that if someone redials
you, police can do nothing? Isnt it
amazing that if someone pranks your
grandmother and nearly puts her in the
hospital, all AT&T asks is "did they
threaten any murders?" yet when a
defense subcontractor gets a prank
call, all they gotta do is ask???
  Prime Anarchist Productions is
appalled that such a mockery of justice
can happen. We are asking your support
to help free William Winterholer of any
charges this friday. If he gets
punished in any way for this, you will
most likely see people getting jailed
for joybuzzers, shaken up pepsi cans,
and whoopie cushions.
  Hell, you'll probably get the
deathpenalty for putting a kickme sign
on someone's back.
  The line Winterholer was jamming had
NOTHING to do with national security;
it had no bearing on the actual
function of the shipbuilding facility;
and it certainly wasnt needed in our
struggle to kill communists.
  The line Winterholer was jamming was
specially set up by president Tovar so
that potential scabbs could call in and
discuss quitting their union and go to
work breaking the strike.
  Free William Winterholer.
  He didnt do anything malicious.
Nothing lifethreatening; and basically,
it wasnt harrassing anyone. He
wardialed the scabline. If he didnt do
it; I would have.

This issue is mainly about General
Dynamics. Although some other stories
follow, most of them are on that common
theme. Have fun. Read and enjoy. If all

I put in my dime and begin a local
call. The thing clicks twice and the
operator bleeps in.
  "Would you like the faster more
efficient service for an additional
fifteen cents?" she asked me. "No
thanks," said I. 10 cents is plenty.
And the connections have been fine
lately. She said OK, bleeped off, and I
  heard two clicks. Suddenly I was
standing there faced with my dialtone
again. And I lost my dime too.

/FEMA NOT AT GD/

  I have swept the entire plant at
General Dynamics, Electric Boat Div, in
Groton Ct.
  Doing this, I proved myself wrong. My
original theory was that EB would be a
nice place to store blacks and
dissidents under the FEMA project.
  A good look at EB showed me it would
be too difficult.
  Although the buildings are all large
enough for such an evil venture, all
room's purposes are too set to rework
themselves for detention of humans.
  Closest one would be the Midway, near
Bluff Point in Poquonnock Bridge part
of Groton. But again, I dont forsee it
changing from what it's currently doing
if martial law were declared.
  This is a huge warehouse with 4 1/2
loading docks up front. The thing is
full of berrings, bolts, gyroscopes,
pumps, washing machines, and all the
other lincoln log parts that go
together to form a fast attack
submarine.
  It would take too long to empty this
building out if you wanted to stuff it
with a bunch of people of color or
something.
  If Connecticut has a concentration
camp participating in FEMA's lockemup
project, it is not Electric Boat.

UNION STEWARD ACCUSED OF JAMMING EB
HOTLINE
Police Say Computer Used To Foul Up
Line  GROTON-- City police have
arrested a union steward from Electric
Boat for allegedly using a computer to
jam phone numbers that EB established
to help strikers return to work.
  William H. Winterholer, 31, of 57
Nathan Hale Road, Groton, has been
charged with harassment for allegedly
programming a computer to repeatedly
dial EB strike hotline numbers. The
computer calls made it difficult for
callers to get through to the company
for information, police said.
  EB first began receiving the bogus
calls on July 25 and they contacted
city police.
  "Workers were answering the calls,
but there was no one there," said
Police Chief Robert D. Laurie.
  Police then called SNETco which
traced the call to Winterholer's
address, Laurie said.
  Police obtained a search warrant and,
on July 28, found a computer terminal
in Winterholer's residence with the EB
strike hotline phone numbers visible on
the display screen.
  The calls were coming in on all three
strike phone lines set up by EB, Laurie
said, "making it difficult for anyone
who legitimately wanted to call in to
get in on them," he said.
  EB announced Friday in its newsletter
"Directions" that the hotlines are back
to normal.
  Winterholer was released by police.
He is scheduled to appear Aug. 11 in
New London Superior Court.
  Joseph W. Messier, president of the
striking Metal Trades Council, said he
could not discuss the incident. "I
don't really know that much about it,"
he said. "He (Winterholer) wasn't
operating on the behalf of any union."
  Messier confirmed that Winterholer
was a union steward, but he would not
say to which union Winterholer
belonged. The MTC represents 10 local
unions at the submarine building
shipyard.
  While the hotlines are designed to
answer a variety of questions from
striking members of the Metal Trades
Council, EB reported Friday that the
most common questions (267 calls) have
been from strikers who want to know how
to return to work.
  The 10,000 member MTC has been on
strike since July 1. While the majority
of workers have honored union picket
lines, the company reported that 613
MTC-represented workers returned to
work in the yard on Friday.
  The union went on strike 37 days ago
after EB refused to offer any wage
increases, proposing only lump-sum
bonus payments.
  The company reported in its
newsletter that a first class mechanic
making $12.02 an hour has missed $2,500
in pay since July 1.
  Both sides reported Friday that no
new negotiations are scheduled.

=========================
  A week ago a Navy 1st class was
arrested by Groton Town Police for
molesting three 10 year olds.
  One was his daughter and the others
were 2 of her friends who were spending
the night. Groton Town held him for 3
hours then let him go. He went to court
this week and received a restraining
order that disallows him from going
near his wife and kids for 6 months and
that's all he got. This was never put
in the local paper and the navy will
not release any info.
  We got our info from the mother of
one of the girls. This and other sick
things have been going on in navy
housing this year. For instance, a 17
year old youth molested a 5 year old
infant seven times over a period of a
week, while he baby sat her. A 39 year
old molested a 12 year old. Yesterday
an 11 year old girl was kidnapped from
Hickory Drive by a male in a gray
mustang with yellow doors. If you get
any info, please give a call to 445-
9721; ask for Kelly Fogg.
  Please join our neighborhood Pervert
Watch Program.
  PWP is brought to you by PAP.

          AIRWAVE TO TELLIE
sung to the tune of Stairway to
          Heaven by Led Zeppelin
 
There's a machine on the phone
If she answers I'm not home
And she's recording your voice for
                   the listening.
 
And it's said if you leave
Your name and a phone number
I might get it and return your
                   fone call.
 
If there's a reason you must reach me
And I'm not here.
There's a chance I might check in.
 
There's an amp by my bed
And it beeps real loud.
Your call relies on my muh-chine.
 
 
             BELL PIE
To the tune of "American Pie"
 
Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be
 
But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capitalism!
 
I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled
                         in size,
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell system... died.
 
And we were singing...
Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo
                    from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!
                    we all cry
Ma Bell why did you have to die?
 
Is your office step by step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everyone used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
And ISDN will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a touchtone fone
                     real soon...
The color fones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat,
My area code is low
The prestige way to go!
 
Back when we were at one rate,
Phone installs didnt cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with no ballyhoo,
And 411 was free-- seemed very fair!
But FCC wanted it seems
To let others skim long distance
                creams;
No matter bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!
 
And so one day it came to pass,
That great Bell System did collapse
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... Died
 
So bye bye...
 
I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the labs
                     were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago
 
But it was empty, dark, and ever so
                       forlorn...
 
No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasnt a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...
 
And so that's how it all occured,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.
 
So bye bye...
