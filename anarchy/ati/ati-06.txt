Welcome to the August ATI. This actually came out AFTER the September issue.
  Figure that one out. hehehe. This one is actually dated August 15th. It's the
  Again...
  We have an addition to our staff.
EE - The Minuteman'll be checkin in
now and then. He's a contributing
editor.
  So anyways, (where was I) hmmm...
  EE is the new guy on the block. He
writes pretty good, so treat him
right,
ok? We got a really cool issue here.
 
 
                                   /
                                  /.

                             .
                      .There is a semi
 blocking the road near the hospital
 gate on the base. The driver of the
truck is in the hobby shop and the
traffic is backed up to the chow hall.
15 cars use a parking lot to go around
this truck to get off the base. A cab
(driven by me) goes this same route to
get off the base but as I'm going
through the parking lot a base security
car stops me. As he gets to the window
he says "Niggers and cabdrivers think
they are better than anyone else". He
then asks me for my licence. I had to
open the door of my vehicle to get my
licence out. He draws his weapon and
locks and loads it and says "get back
in the vehicle asshole". Me feeling
threatened and not wanting to be
cornered in the cab were he to get
trigger happy, I got all the way out
of the car and he held the weapon on
me then he put it away. I asked him if
he was hitler youth and when are they
getting the brown shirts and swastikas,
and refused to show him my licence
because he was not a representative of
the state of conn. He then tells me
that he is god on the subbase and he
can take my licence if he wants. So I
told him "come and get, but if I fall
down watch for a weapon when I come
back up". He gave me a ticket for
improper passing but he never got to
see my licence or reg.
  So if you drive onto the new Nazi
training camp, errrr, I mean the sub
base dont pass anything even if it
means you park in the road for 2 days.
Last night I sat behind a security car
giving a ticket for 15 minutes.
  He told me to go around; I said no
way, "I dont want to get a ticket" and
I sat there till he was done and
followed him up the street where I
left the base.

===========================
= info following brought  =
= on by a need for more   =
=  real information   =)  =
===========================
  On 4 August, 1933, the new
chancellor
of Germany, Herr Hitler, had for the
first time received a delegation of
American Businessmen at Berchtesgaden.
 
  It consisted of 2 men: Colonel
Sosthenes Behn and his representative
in Germany, Henry Mann. The meeting
was the beginning of a very special
relationship between ITT and the Third
Reich.
  One Herr Schroeder and our Sosthenes
Behn had been found in 1945 in a
prison camp in France, wearing the
battle dress of an SS corporal. Both
worked for years as highlevel execs at
ITT after the war.
  What lay behind this remarkable
transmogrification of Behn the
Hitler-supporter into Behn the Allied
hero? Part of the story is still
buried in secret files; but it's clear
that colonel Behn, at some stage of
the war, became very close to American
intelligence agencies, and that he
could perform useful services for
them, with his own private information
network.
  While the justice department and the
FBI continued to distrust him,
military intelligence found him and
his telephones indispensible. In Latin
America, American agents were placed
in the ITT offices of Bolivia,
Paraguay, and Argentina, among others;
and Behn, on his visits to Europe,
could bring back information through
Switzerland and Spain about the state
of the Axis.
  Neat, eh? Most of that is from a
document I sort of declassified. Er,
reclassified for them, would be a
better phrase, I guess.

EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
EDITORIAL
VIEWS HEREIN DO NOT
NECESSARILY REPRESENT OPINIONS
OF THE STAFF HERE AT ATI; BUT
THEY MIGHT.
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
  IT SEEMS Police officers follow
much different rules and regulations
than we must obey.
  If you remember an editorial I wrote
about 2 months ago, a town police
officer made a precedent over the fone
saying "if it was the middle of the
night, and he wasnt a hazard to anyone;
he could go about 30 miles over the
speed limit, run stop lights, and
assorted other minor traffic
violations.
  For the next 2 weeks or so, local police officers would pass by me at
the speed limit, and suddenly
accellerate to about 50 miles per hour
using their flashing lights for about
30 feet. That's about all they could
do to acknowlege they didnt like
my newspaper article, because I was
a pedestrian. And since I dont litter,
or jaywalk, things became uneventful
til I purchased a moped last month.
  I've been pulled over more times in
the last month, than in my entire 9
years driving motor vehicles. Most
of the time they just take my licence,
look it over for identificaton, and
give it back to me in less than 45
minutes.
  About 2am last nite I was pulled
looked all around, saw there was no traffic, and since I was a hazard
to no one, proceeded thru. He gave me
a 50 dollar fine.
  He then told me my drivers licence
was now his property as it was "very
expired". (It expired February this
year, and I'd been using it for ID.
Keep in mind how many times officers
have pulled me over and used it
primarily and solely for ID)
  At any rate, he drove off with my
licence. I called the dispatcher and
requested special permission to have
my drivers licence back as it was my
only form of ID. He cleared it thru
his sargent, and told me the officer
would be by to pick it up.
  I then listened over my scanner and
allowed the officer to "drop it off
when I get a chance". An hour went by;
so I called the dispatcher to ask if
he'd give the guy a ring,and that
things were busy.
  An hour later, my licence came to
me. In both those hours the ONLY things
that came over regarding Groton City
were 4 "reg" and ID's, 3 routines at
Washington Park, 2 rendevous at West
Side junior high, and a striker
disorderly and drunk.
  They cant say they were extremely
busy, the officer was obviously
dillydallying to spite me for going
over his head.
  HE then told me in front of my
friends that if he hears my motor
running before Tuesday morning, he's
going to lock me in jail overnite,
confiscate the bike, and auction it
off. I stared him down with a
nonverbal "how-can-you-talk-like-that"
while my friend, Sean, got it all on
cassette tape. I then went off to
put my moped away. The officer went up
the road and rendevoused with his
backup. I walked over to his cruiser
to inform him that the bike was
locked and I had every intention of
renewing my licence first thing in
the morning. He did 0-50 in
about 8 seconds on a road that belongs
25 mph.
  My friend later informed me that
"he's walking toward you. I think you
better get" came over the scanner
onto my cassette recorder.
  Look, I'm shipping out this November
with the US Army to defend this seeming
"justiceless" country. Ten years from
now, I'll probably move back to this
county somewhere and bring up children.
  I should hope that if I'm molesting
my 10 year old daughter, you'd lock
me up in jail instead of citing my 12
year old son for jogging on the wrong
side of the street.

operator do a major jamup!!!
  "marine operator this is the
vessel 24051, I need to make a collect
call to suchand such a number".
  "24051, what is your name?"
  "24051, operator. that's the name
of my vessel".
  "I need YOUR name 24051."
  "Why do you need my name?"
  "I've never heard of a boat with
all numbers before, I need your name."
  "No can do over the airwaves,
operator. This is a public vessel,
and those are my call numbers."
  "THEN YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO MAKE YOUR
