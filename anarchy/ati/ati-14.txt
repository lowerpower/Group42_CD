                 :    /WELL I SEE that
                 :   /EB will be coming
                 :  /off strike soon.
FAH-Q'S CORNER   : /What can that mean
------------------/to the employers in
the area?
 
  Well 14 that I talked to over the last week told me that 44% of their part
time and 28% of their full time employees are EB strikers and that most of the
plan to go back to work at EB when the strike is over. That could mean that
there will be a lot of jobs open to the unemployed come next month, but on the
other side, some of the employers I talked to told me that they opened those
jobs to the strikers because they remember the last long strike and felt that
longer exist when the strike is over. Two of the local taxi companies have
almost all EB strikers as their employees. Now, some of them plan on staying o
as cab drivers because the income can be good (500-700 a week) Most will retur
to work because though the potentials there in the cab for good money is not
always the case. There are bad weeks and good weeks and no benefits. So if you
have a family to support there is a choice between making maybe 500 a week and
a paycheck at the end of the week. You decide. When this strike is over I
expect to see a few unhappy employers in the area for a while and if you are
looking for a job there are certainly gunna be a lot of them out there. We at
ATI, we're all for the strike, and now  / that it's all over we would like  /
to see the families/ get back on their / feet.
  Thank you. :   /
             :  /WELL, ELECTION TIME IS
             : /almost on us again and
             :/who do you vote for?
--------------Also who will vote. If
you dont vote you better keep your mouth shut when it comes to the
president because if you dont like him you COULD HAVE voted against him.
  Now that I have that out of the way let me give you a few of my thoughts
about the US election process. We elect an official to office by voting.  Well
if everyond doesnt go out to vote the process wont work right. I mean if there
are 3 million people and only 1 million vote doest that reflect what the publi
as a whole thinks??? (on a united nations poll of 45 "democracies" based solel
on voter turn out, the US ranked 45th) No. The poor and unemployed dont like t
get out and vote because, "man I've been poor this long what makes you think
voting will change anything". Well It could change a lot if all the unemployed
and poor voted. Taxes. Well I dont care who gets in to office and on what
promise he got there on. He will have to raise taxes to make the budget meet.
You want more money for the roads, schools, police, and other things. Well
where do you think that moolah comes from? The government doesnt pull it off
the trees. And any candidate that tells you that he can run this country
without raising any taxes is a fuckin lier and should get out of the race now
because he lives in a dream world./

(APWN)Sprint-Thursday nite, Doc Telecom formerly known as Laser, was pretty
much busted by Sprint.  Telecom was selling his computer to someone when there
was a knock on his door. Telecom's brother answered the door; Daniel M. Loredo
manager Kansas City, and R. E. "Sandy" Sandquist, manager Denver.
  After the warrant schitt out of the way, they came in and looked thru all
of Telecom's stuff.
  Upon seeing a disk labeled "Phrack 18, Phrack 19, FH.Exe" Loredo said it was
incriminating. Telecom argued it was nothing more than text files.  The Sprint
reps then looked thru Telecom's weekly notes finding CBI accounts, trw
accounts,
and a citibank. But no calling cards. They wanted sprint codes, according to
Telecom.
  "They can just suck," said Telecom, "my long dong silver here."
  Telecom says he was supposed to download sixty-five thousand (65,000)
sprint FON cards the other nite.
  "hehehe. Well at least I knew there were a lot. It would take 30 megs of
my drive."
  Sprint reps said they have his number and he was on their system for 19 or
so hours.
  "Just think," said Telecom. "This same shit happened last year. Remember
  A local Telecommunications enthusiast named Cygnus says this pattern has
been going on for more than 5 years now. Every year, around October,
security people start making charges and they dont let up til around
Christmas time. Almost as if they have to reach their quotas.
  "This is not good news," said Cygnus.

ITT's Newsletter to customers has interesting information: One page of the
newsletter cheerfully tells ITT customers in the state of California that
beginning October 1, their intra- state rates will decrease by an average of 1
percent.  Then, the next page of the newsletter announces that the California
Public Utilities Commission instituted a surcharge on intrastate telephone
calls in California to fund deaf and disabled communications programs, to be
effective on, you guessed it, October 1st.  And, the newsletter adds, the
surcharge is being "passed along".
 
This is reminiscent of an interesting incident last year regarding California
intrastate surcharges and AT&T's long distance rates.  In an incident last
year, an AT&T intracompany memo stated that although they recently lowered
them that their intrastate rates were too low and they had to raise them.  So,
they agreed to AT&T's proposal that the increase they were forced to implement
would appear on customers' invoices in the form of a new surcharge that would
be STRICTLY AT&T revenue!  Ah, what blatant attempts to fool the consumer!
 
In another development, Allnet instituted a new policy in which a $.90 per
month "bill handling charge" is imposed on all customers who make long distanc
calls, but whose charges amount to less than $10 per month.  So much for the
"We value your business, large or small" credo!

To the tune of the Night Before Christmas:
 
Twas an hour before Oprah
and all thru New York
No TV was idle,
all employees stopped work.
 
They all watched the lady
discuss current affairs
The studio audience
was combing their hair.
 
No one paid attention
Nobody could care less
They're too busy watchin
that tent sized dress.
 
This one guy stood up
and started beating his daughter,
Hey, it's not my fault
he has Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder!!!
 
 
(APWN)New London-
  Political artist Faith Ringgold has spent the last three days at Connecticut
college in New London, guiding "issue oriented" students in the art department
to an artistic expression of their opinions on social issues.
  The six students working under Ms.  Ringold's instruction are preparing a
performance piece to be presented tonight at 8 in the East Dance Studio at the
Crozier-Williams Student Center. Ms. Ringgold will also give a lecture titled
"Faith Ringgold Talks About Her Art".
  "The students have been asked to become a character that represents an issue
that will be very important in the year 2000," said Ms. Ringgold Wednesday.
"They've come up with six issues or characters: apathy, God, nuclear winter,
drugs, child abuse, and computerized memory loss."
