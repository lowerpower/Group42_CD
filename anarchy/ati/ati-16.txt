***MAN EATEN BY LARGE CANOE (CON'T)***
(APWN)Quinektukut-- I lay back and
sun myself.
  Close my eyes, I'm a Pequot. I
haven't slept in 3 days. Her lady,
Tracy, has teased me all week leaving
me frustrated, blue, balling in my tent
at night.
  A settler would cry himself to sleep.
  I cry long long enough 'til I am
severely spooked. I close my eyes and
see Her Lady standing in front of me.
  Not a thread of clothing. Only a tiny
triangle of hair marking the place
where she does not allow me to touch.
  Just yet.
  "Girls," you say to me; in your
colonial tone of voice. "Can't live
without 'em; can't live with em."
  "I cant live," I say so only I can
hear. I will fast for three more days.
I will weight less than I did before.
I will be weak, sleek, and slender,
the sex god you want me to be, my
Lady.
  I will return, we will feast. You
will break my fast.
  You will adore me; I will return.
  I open my eyes, you are paddling
down the Thames. We must go around
the point and meet Kthe eastern dark
teenagers.
  They signalled us they have some
killer tobacco, right from the Cubano's
private stash.
  We will smoke, and dance, and talk of
warring against the elders and their
segregated style. Their bitter grudges
on those who dont look or act like
them.
  We all fall to the ground exhauseted
from our battle rehearsal. Smiting
takes a lot out of a Pequot like I.
But it must be tougher on you, my
colonial friend.
  I wonder if the darks know about
hatred; back in the Giant Island in
the Orient's way.
  I ask of you.
  "Let's find out," you suggest. We
turn toward our tobacco friends.
  "Do any of you hate," you ask them.
Nothing but silence; suddenly 3 no's.
  "I know survival and pride," says
one dark friend.
  "I cannot hate," says another. I tell
you all WE CAN PULL THIS OFF.
  We will build a raft. I will teach
you how to grab fish right out of the
water.
  You will show us your medallians--
tell us of all the wrongs your father
locked into your head.

PRIEST ALBUM ATTACKED BY SLOVENLY PIGS
(APWN)Only In Amerika-- Judas Priest's
new album is being
attacked by the PMRC for having lyrical
content, and subliminal messages they
are claiming caused two teenagers to
commit suicide over.
  Gimme a break. PMRC says they are
about to take all the albums off the
shelves and gather up all the
production crew for a listening of the
album. If it is proven that the album
caused these deaths, they intend to
keep the creative endeavor on hold.
  All reports say that alcohol and
marijuana was also involved between
these two teenagers.
  We here at ATI recommend that when
this orgy takes place, that Tipper
Gore, and Barbara Bush et al do large
bowls of killer weed and drink massive
amounts of Bacardi's to get the true
all-around effect these two boys got.
  Can you believe things are getting
this out of hand? The witch-hunt has
just begun. Keep in mind that if you
play Ronald Reagan backwards, you get
"nigger porno" and "noriega" becomes
"get your own lawyer". This and other
totally obscene thoughts brought to
you by ATI in conjunction with the
First Ammendment.
  What's left of it.

TO THE TUNE OF "CHESTNUTS ROASTING"
Flame broiled Whoppers in
a cardboard box.
French fries sizzling in fat.
Eat them fast or they're soggy and flat
Burger King is where it's at.
 
You know that Herb is on his way.
And his whole entire ad campaign is gay
Even though, they do it your way,
It still costs too much for
     steroid sandwiches these days.

AMY -by the Prime Anarchist
 
Amy
You taught me
Quiate.
Noiseless, patient, strong,
still bold, imaginative, frim.
Yet quiet, calm.
The subtle approach.
 
You showed me
Quiet.
How to sit indian style.
For X-tra long time
Alone.
With friends.
The quiet one.
 
You smiled, said hello.
Cosigned a petition or 2.
Moved my soul.
You got up.
Back to Providence.
 
I think of you.
When I'm
Quiet.
Relaxing, watching my surroundings
Panic.
 
Sometimes when I'm loud
too.
And I know I should
Quiet.
I calm by thinking
Your short blond hair,
remembering when it was
longer.
Hoping I'll see you again;
Knowing we'll chat again.
 
Amy.
It's 3 a.m.
Wanna camp out for
Dead tickets
Tonight?
