fan orationf  JUST TIP THE SCALES
/          /  OF JUSTICE.
f 10-22-88 f     CONN college, you just
/          /  informed me that 2 of
-----------  your students are getting
suspended, and one expelled for acts
of vandalism. From what I hear, all
they did was break a window when they
were drunk one nite.
  On one hand you should be outraged.
This punishment far outweighs the crime
and very unjustly. On the other hand
you should notice that Conn College is
simply following a recent trend along
with other colleges, other
institutions, other countries.
  You see zero-tolerance laws seizing
large boats because of 3 joints or 4
hits of acid, sometimes just for
paraphanelia on board.
  Congress is about to see to it that
the death penalty be mandated for
convicted drug dealers. Maranda rights
are swiftly going the way of the Cave
man, and Friday-the-13th sequels. The
First Ammendment? What first
ammendment?
  I'm not signing your petition mainly
because I dont go here. But let me
impress this on you. If you believe
that the college campus is a microcosm;
a practice spot for the real world
you'll soon face, or even a big part
of the real world,
GET OUT THERE AND GET THE "CONN THREE"
BACK IN SCHOOL.
  The petition is fine. But followthru.
Serve it to the right people. Sit in,
camp out, demonstrate. Stop school.
  Send out fliers "suspending" EVERYONE
until "Conn 3" are back attending.
  I'm thinking of fasting in a glass
booth for 3 days to symbolize the
outrage; maybe shattering it on the
3rd day.
  Get out there and show your rage.
Win this one, and then we can start
working on this Omnibus/zero/Drug
hysteria thing.
 
..............
another oration
..............
Que es "free enterprise"?
Que es "central intelligence".
Intelligente del central?
Si! Si! Es mui facile.
Que es "political suicide".
El George Bush y el Manny Noriega
Esta en; que es, que es, how you say
"Cohort"? El medejeem columbian cocaine
Cartel.
Los drugs. Los drugs. Esta. Diga. Oye.
"Just say Noriega to drugs".
 
Now they're executing the death pen.
for drug dealers? Hmmm. I say we start
a lobby group pushing for Mr. Bush
to get the chair then.

         ARMAGEDDON ISLE
  TO THE TUNE OF: Gilligin's Isle...
It all started when we tried to smoke
A joint that was too fat.
We smoked it from beginning to end
In 30 seconds flat.
Them buds they crackled
'n' seeds all popped as
Paper inched across.
I noticed that my head was getting
High as a kite.
High as a kite.
 
The thoughts grew few and far between,
the topics were of peace.
If not for the US and our secret wars
The whole world would be free.
The whole world would be free.
 
So then the others turned to me
And this is what one said.
  We can have peace,
  And Freedom too,
  Equality,
  And justice.
 
But the movie star
Is a war monger and greedy bastard.
Here on Armageddon Isle.
Here on Raygun's Isle.
Here on Bush's Isle.

  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MICHAEL
     JACKSON'S ONE GLOVE
  I have figured it out.
  It is not to be cool. It is not to
start a trend. It is not out of respect
for those that only have one arm.
  Michael Jackson wears a glove on his
right hand for shaking hands with
white people.
  I was watching his new "movielet"
the other day, and noticed that he
wore the glove whilst shaking hands. I
put that and the oxygen tank he sleeps
in, all together and deduced that he
must be afraid to touch people.
  Then in the movie, you see him go
into his hometown. He puts the glove
in his coat pocket, and all his
"brothers" gather around:
  "gimme five, man"
  "lay it on me"
  "slap me silly, homeboy"
  "put it there"
  Michael Jackson wont touch white
people. I am almost sure of it.

Y-rhode island is so poor, and ct is

dont?
L-they are nato's f-16 and they were
in spain, now they're coming in italy.
Y-nato? hmmm. in the name of peace no
less? I'd be worried about the missile
silos we have stationed all thruout
europe. I saw a russian comic in Pravda
that portrayed europe as "united states
of europe". hehehe
L-I think israel is right to do that
to palestinian.
Y-hmmm. what makes you say that,
pretell?
L-what is pretel?-
Y-hmm. slang for, like, "please do
tell me". hmmm. umm. you think the
israelis have the rights to that land?

 e e e e e e   A PAYPHONE IS WORTH A
  a a a a a   THOUSAND DIMES;
   t t t t   EXTENTIONS ARE WORTH
    ! ! !   MILLIONS OF DIGITS.
     ! !      Wow.
      !     This place is just infested
with plain old desktop AT&T touchtone
fones. Each one has a four digit # on
it. What tipped me off (to what?) was a
payphone with one of these fones right
next to it.
  This set of fones was in the library
of a private college; (try a private
college near you. You know how
we are about naming names. Especially
when it's Connecticut College).
  Anyways, with what I know now, it's
a wonder that payphone gets any dimes.
What are they teaching you in college??
I finished my payphone call and
decided to try something.
  I scanned a few 4-digit #'s. Not much
I got. Just a few professoras,
secretaries, and students, a buncha
"wrong #s" and a reorder.
  A reorder???
  I tried "0".
  "Can you connect me with 800-424-9090
  "Sure. For the next time dial "9"
then the #".
  Credible. Not credible, wow. I cant
believe they'd leave something like
this so vulnerable. They must take
today's kollege kid for a fool.
  They're probably right.
  I did a few local calls and got out
of there. Even if there's no LD (long
distance) there's myriad extenders,
divertors, and local carriers to play
around with there.
  Now, to find out which buildings are
open 24!!!
