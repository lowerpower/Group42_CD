         PUBLIC PAY PHONES
   WHEN A BUSINESS PUTS A PUBLIC PAY
TELEPHONE ON THEIR PROPERTY AND PUTS
UP A SIGN SAYING PUBLIC PHONE.DO THEY
HAVE TO LET THE PUBLIC USE THAT PHONE?
WE AT ATI SAY YES..AND THE PHONE CO.
SAYS YES ALSO.BUT SOME ESTABLISHMENTS
SAY NO...PUBLIC PHONES ARE FOR GUESTS
AND CUSTOMERS ONLY NO MATTER WHAT THAT
SIGH SAYS.
 WE WERE AT A LOCAL HOTEL(I WON'T NAME
THEM BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW WE ARE WHEN
IT COMES TO PLACES LIKE THE BEST
WESTERN OLYMPIC INN)USEING THE PAY
PHONE TO CALL A LONG DISTANCE NO.WHEN
I PUT MY COINS(2.75)IN AND GOT AN
ANSWER ON THE PHONE A SECURITY GUARD
CAME OVER AND HUNG UP THE PHONE AND
TOLD ME TO LEAVE THE PAY PHONES WERE
FOR GUESTS OF THE HOTEL ONLY.I SAID
"THESE ARE PUBLIC PAY PHONES AND I AM
THE PUBLIC...SO I WANT TO USE THE
PUBLIC PHONE...THANK YOU" HE REACHED
OUT AND GRABED THE RECEAVER FROM MY
HAND AND SAID"YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF
HERE BEFORE I KICK YOUR ASS..THESE ARE
PUBLIC PAY PHONES ONLY IF I SAY THEY
ARE AND I SAY THEIR NOT SO LEAVE" SO
I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING"I WILL BE
TALKING TO YOUR BOSS TOMORROW(WHO I
HAPPEN TO KNOW REALY WELL)AND WILL
TELL HIM ABOUT THIS AND I WILL BE
CALLING THE PHONE CO. AND TELLING THEM
ALSO AND WITH ANY LUCK THEY WILL
REMOVE THE PUBLIC PAY PHONES THAT
THE PUBLIC IS PROHIBITED BY THIS
ESTABLISHMENT FROM USEING....OH BY THE
WAY I WANT MY 2.75 BACK NOW OR I WILL
REMOVE ONE OF THOSE PHONES NOW MYSELF.
SO I AM CALING THE TELE CO. AND
TELLING WHAT HAPPENED I HOPE THEY
REMOVE THE PHONES...WHO WANTS TO STAY
IN A HOTEL THAT CHARGES 100 A NIGHT
AND .85 FOR EVERY LOCAL CALL MADE FROM
THE ROOM.
   I TRAVEL ALOT AND STAY IN ALOT OF
HOTELS AND I WOULD NOT STAY IN ONE
WITHOUT A PAY PHONE.

  A review-- (Short Sharp Shocked by
Michelle Shocked) -- If Tracy Chapman
is gonna be the next Dylan; then
Michelle Shocked is surely the next
John Lennon.
  But that's as far as it goes.
Michelle Shocked is totally innovative.
She takes Ricky Lee Jones type sounds
and puts modern folk lyrics to the
tunes.
  It's got a strong bluesy beat,
actually rocks out, if you listen.
Good, good work. A must recommend for
any serious musicphenomenon fanatic.

  Best handle of the day (1) was
Jello Slut King. (a possible alltime)
  Second best handle so far (2) was
aDmiRe A GOod Nurse. Third went to
Love fishnets. 4th was Juvenis
Puella(bi); and 5th was Nine Fingers.
  Shaved Teen turned out to be a guy,
but it still was innovative enough to
take 6th. 7th place went to Modem
Goddess..!! Pantyhose Fetish placed
8th, and Trapped Whale slipped down
from second last week to 9th this
week.
  Tenth place went to a girl who went
to bed and came back as Nola With
Pillow. She brought the jama party to
CIS, so we didnt have to go there.
  Too bad.
  Also rans were Free Electron, and
Gingersnap. Both rumored to be (bi).

NOTES FROM DUST-F-SKI
   by Dust-f-ski (naturally)
Just finished shreddin my garbage.
  Thanks to Wanda Gamble, I have to
worry about these trivial things.
  Keeps me out of jail.
  No visits to the house yet, but my
mail's being tampered with.
  I feel raped.

    -God Bless

    Other people have written about
explosives and other nasty things like
that...well here is some more...
    You take some stirofoam and add gas
you will have to work on the amounts
till you get what you want but the
correct substance should be a runny
jelly.you but this jelly in a bottle
and light it like a cocktail and throw
it and the jelly will stick to what it
hits.
    Put an m-80 in a jar filled with
bb's add i lid and you have a gernade
bleach in a rubber then put into a gas
tank.runn like hell when you do this
it don't take long to explode.
    Use bathtub sealer(BF.GOODRICH
PL200 construction adheasive is
great)and seal around the vent ports
on someones car battery so nothing
leaks out.turn the battery upside down
leaving the leads connected.the gasses
will buildup with nowhere to go the
gasses will explode.
    Charcoal,sugar,magnesium,saltpeter
make an easy explosive if under
pressure.
    The old easy ohio blue tips
crammed into a pipe work good.
    A good detinator is a solar
igniter used for model rockets.
If you can't get one of these break
the glass off of a flash lite bulb
(1157A auto bulbs work best)be
careful not to break the filiment.
add 9 or 12v dc depending on the
bulb.a good way of doing this is to
connect some wire to a car battery
then to one side of a momentary
switch(always off)and then run some
wire(50-100ft)to your bulb or other
igniter needing voltage press the
button and boom.
    Well if you already know
these things sorry
    Be careful

   MOORABOUT schITT
  Assets for schITT? 3.9 Billion.
Total assetts for the whirld corp is
14B. Liabilities are 3B.
  D.C. Thomas became chief operating
officer in April 88. This year schITT
bought back 5 million shares of their
stock. I'm not positive on this, but
I think that's about 5% of the corp.
  schITT's main accountant is Artie
Anderson.
  In '86. schITT transferred almost all
of its telecom manufacturing operations
to a joint venture  with Campagnie
Genearal c'Electricite of France. (A
french connection? yup. you betcha.
And even B-4 the great schITT nazi-ism
days)
  Other people to watch at schITT
besides Araskog, and Thomas are:
  Anderson, Aibel, Simmons, Carpenter,
Woodward, Weadock, Alleman, Avin,
Anderson, Archibald, Burnett, David,
Eagleburger, Keejee, Meyer, Payton,
Powell, Schoellhorn, White.
  schITT started in 1920 incorporating
as International Telephone and
Telegraph corporation. Corporate name
changed to schITT 123183. (cont)
 
Well, that's it for this issue of ATI,

special Berated Belated B-rated
HalloweenColombus Day issue; and after
that might be a special "World-Series-
Baseball-Bores-Me-To-Death" issue.
