 A patriotic song written by
Woodrow Wilson Guthrie. Upon
completing 4th grade, you had
to know this song.
 Turns out, Woodie was editor
and publisher of CWP, (communist
workers party) newspaper.

DO YOU BELIEVE IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT?
Here's a nice concise poem dealing
with the Omnibus drug clause giving
the death penalty to drug kingpins. Now
I'm sure they were ready to convict
Noriega, but what happens when King
George the 1st from Bushville is a
major runner for Noriega?
  Just say NOriega to drugz???
  I say:
 
Bush+Noriega=Kingpin/Deathpenalty.
 
That's the poem. One line. Once again
proving that drugs dont kill people,
9-0 supreme courts kill people.

The first guy who tried a sting in
front of my face. (We almost fell
for it.)
  by prime anarchist
  This guy is a killer dweeb. He used
half of his bbs as a database for
the local phreaks. A lot of
incriminating things were posted. Both
on HIS part and our part. Here's some
of it. It turns out this was going
to be his "easy in" for the Connecticut
state police Special Forces Team.
  We took care of him quickly and
legitimately. (We missed being too late
by about 3 days) Here's a few of the
posts to give you a quick idea.

   Re: FILE
Hey, I got a file off of the works
called TELENET.DOC, it has a bunch
of access and account numbers for the
telenet network..  Check it out
and let me know what you can make of
it...  It is just a list of numbers
and prefixes, no information on how to
use it...

Yeah. I never tried the works. It's my
impression that none of
the sysops phreak, they're just
infomaniacs, so have all those
files. That's probably just a cover

   Re: (R)BLUE BOXING PLANS!!!
Sometimes Marc Arnold. Mostly the
Prime Anarchist.
I used Reid Maccluggage, but you know
the score there. I've been
known to use Louis Levine, David Lien,
and Justin Cayce.
other than that, I'm just marc arnold.
I usually only use fake
stuff when I'm paranoid. Like official
AT&T or Tandy affiliated
boards that just happen to have a hack
phreak section. Be leary
there.
oh, if you see a username, Garbol,
that's me, too.
I've mostly been using marc arnold,
and or prime anarchist. I'm
now making a name for myself as
opposed to being annonomous and
wondered about.
I have some printouts I'm planning to
be mailing out, and I want
people to know who it was instead of
"mystery person".

The raised seal that you are talking
of is just some seal of the city
in which you were born.  The MVD never
looks at it, they just "feel" the
paper to see if it is there.  For
about
10-20 bucks, you can buy your
own seal that will accomplish the same
thing.  We have one for our
business.  We had it made for about 30
bucks and it has our company logo
on it and the presidents name.  They
are real easy to come by.                            mmark

be building the White box...   The

anyone who truly believes that LD
should be free would have a hard time
relating to people who would work 9-5
busting them. Likewise, feds probably
cannot comprehend the concept of free
LD, or free ANYTHING for that matter.
For this reason, we here at P A P
are undertaking this       / / /
profile, hoping that each will
understand the other. For, somewhere in
all this truth, I firmly believe, feds
will put down their hatreds and
START PHREAKING!!! hehehe.

          A chick named Wanda Gamble
is working for MCI and is investigating
quite a few people who work for this
newspaper. It has come to pap's
attention that she's already got quite
a bit of background info and is startin
to close the circle in a bit. For this
reason, ATI will be changin location
about 3 times in the next year.
  Now, I cannot think of anything I
have done to flag MCI communications
besides getting overextended on my
calling card. So I'm not too concerned
about this paper's future. I have
purchased a shredder however, and am
disposing of all trash using latest
pyrotechnology. (gonna take a KGB
expert to get past ashes)
  There's also a guy using a handle on
all the bridges who is gathering
handles and area codes for a "database"
he's pretty open about.
  This kind of stuff happens at theend
of each year pretty religiously, but
I have not seen this much fed activity
since way back in the LOD days.
  I would watch congress to see if the
next year or so they dont pass an
"Omnibus Wirefraud Clause". Hmmm, how
about the death penalty for purchasing
an extender from a bum at Penn Central
Station, New York City!!!
