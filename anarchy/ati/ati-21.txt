  The condom in this issue has been
electronically stored on page 3. You'll
find the rim a little thin. That was
Carter-Trojan's idea to make it easier
to
pack. Fear not. It's just as safe.
  Even if you didn't plan on having
sex, go out there and make use of this
rubber.
  Don't let a good thing go to waste.
  The instructions, on how to use one
(as well as how to have sex in general)
are in plain black bold block letter,
so even your 7 year old sister can read
the words "erect penis" and "coming",
as well as "penetration" and "semen".
  If she asks questions or takes an
interest, why not show her how it's
used.
"The top of the condom (RIM) should be
held firmly when withdrawing to avoid
spilling the semen".
  We sent these condoms out so you'd
all perform safe sex; but mostly so
you'd
perform sex.
  How else would my dad sell HIS
magazines. We didnt write the book of
Love;
but here's to say "we want you to play
by the rules".

       IS THE POPE CATHOLIC!?!
 
     A Board-Game Review
 
  Not just an oft-heard rhetorical
question but the name of a historical
and
hilarious new board game. Full of fun
and humor. Rich with nostalgia. A great
way to resurrect fond memories.
Players journey around the rosary bead
board
and climb the rungs of the Church
heirarchical ladder... all in a quest
to
become Pope and winner. A delightful
gift for friends who share a Catholic
heritage or who adore trivia or both.
Easy to learn, two to six can play.
  I havent played it yet, it looks
boring.
