A new class of person has been found
lurking the streets of New York.
  The NOPIE. NOPIES are people that
have vowed a personal NO to drug use
but
firmly believe that no one has the
right to tell others whether they
should do
something to their bodies or not.
  NOPIES replace the yuppie for the
following reasons.  1) yuppie was the
me
generation.
   NOPIE represents the nobody
generation. In fact, they are even
appointing
Nobody as an alternative candidate to
the ones currently runnin.  2) yuppies
are extremely wealthy and seldom give
to causes.
   NOPIES are sometimes seen being
busted for picking up stoned hitch-
hikers
and consequently thrown in jail
overnight as an accomplis. When given
the
chance between jail/fines/donations
NOPIES oftentimes give money to NORML.
 3)
yuppies usually have high tech jobs
like pissmonitor, or pissinspector.
   NOPIES are usually cited with
putting battery acid in the samples, or
selling their clean specimens to
friends.
   All in all the NOPIE will be seen
as a prominent force in the future of
Amerikan activism. While status quo
people and Party Liners "just say no",
you'll hear an occasional "nope", come
out of a smirky looking face. That's a
NOPIE

NOTES FROM THE TOAD. A New Haven
Yippie Convention.
  ATI recently attended a Vicious
Hippies/Wavy Gravy concert.
  It was phenomenal.
  Wavy Gravy started us off with his
"Gong Bong". It involved sitting indian
style in a circle holding hands.  We
were to breath in slowly and deeply
thru
our noses til we couldnt take any more
in, then you let it out hissing thru
your teeth. 14 times is an official
GongBong, according to Hugh Romney, aka
Wavy Gravy. He suggested we start out
with just 7 since we're east coast, and
cant relate to peace and harmony quite
yet.
  The Yale dweebs got offended and
demanded a chance at 14, so we did
fourteen.
Success. On the 14th "hit" you scream
out whatever comes out your lungs, and
the band (Vicious Hippies) takes the
noise in and resubmits it as raucous
rock-n-roll.
  And rock, they did.
  There was a pinjuggler off in the
corner, and an old guy up front doing
the
swim to an Elvis tune. He did assorted
other archaic dances to amuse the young
crowd. Wavy Gravy was out on the dance
floor waving a wammo bubble blower full
of soap bubbles having a grand old
time.
  I'd say the most unique part of
their sound would be from the
percussionist
with his exotic instruments, and the
keyboardist with his unmistakable
Hammond
organ mixed in with assorted synths.
  After about six songs of grateful
dead type all out uninhibited dancing,
we
took a quick break for drinks or
whatever, and out came Wavy Gravy. He
brought
out two chairs. One to sit in, and the
other to hold his makeup kit.  More
than
a musician, more than an activist,
more than a standup comedian, wavy
gravy is
a clown.
  "Clowns are safe," says Gravy. "Can
you say that?" he asks the audience.
"Clowns are safe". He began putting on
his makeup while telling us about times
he took advantage of the fact that
cops WILL NOT HARM A CLOWN ON NATIONAL
TV.
  A peace activist in the 60's, 70's,
80's and 90's, gravy is these days
trying
to stop a logging company in Norton,
VT from doing their dirty work.  They
apparently got permission to do
logging on thousands of acres that
Gravy and
"the people" legally purchased back in
the 60's. The head logger is John
Belued, and for more information on
how YOU CAN HELP STOP THIS LOGGING
SHIT,
call Laura at 802-754-6695.
  He helped us dance to the Vicious
Hippies, and he helped sing to some of
their (his as well) songs. The least
we can do is get him the people's land
back, eh?
  He ended the show singing a few
songs from his album with the help of
the
Hippies, and his helpers sold Tshirts,
albums, and bumperstickers off in the
hall. All in all, it was a good show.
  "Hey, how's this for the tourist
problem?" said Radio Bob Fass. "Wavy
Gravy
gets dressed up real straight and buys
a ticket to go on one of the tours We
all get dressed up as cowboys and hold
up the bus when it turns the corner
into
Second Avenue. We board it, pull Wavy
off and hang him from the lamp post.
Well, not really. We rig up one of
those harnesses under his jacket just
like
they do in the movies."

"Quayle isn't qualified to lead the
nation. How hard Mr. Bush must swallow
when
he talks about the senator's
abilities!" --New London Day newspaper
 
Comes the time Prime Anarchist must
endorse the Duke. Michael Dukakis is
the
better of the two.
  Heck, he's not even the lesser of
two evils. Some of the democrat
platforms I
dont agree with, but a little
lobbying, and assorted other activism
can help
offset any of his ideas. Plus, he's
gonna have some damned good advisors up
there.
  Frankly, Bush scares me. There's
nothing worse than having a KGB member
leading the nation. Except the KGB's
former leader!!!
  There's simply no excuse for secret
leadership of the Central Intelegence
(I
refuse to spell this word correctly in
that context) Agency. We have a
definite
conspiracy here. I heard Raygun the
other morning saying he truly wants to
repeal the 22nd Ammendment. "Not for
myself anymore, but for George. I think
when you're on a roll, you should have
a chance to rule 3 or more terms. Not
just two".
  I have a feeling the incredibly rich
executive leader is gonna do some
serious lobbying in his spare time
next January. Scared? You betcha.
  Read Dukakis' platform entirely. If
there's more than 3 things you dont go
for, then by all means, vote Bush. Or
go Libertarian. But please, if at all
possible, let's have a democrat the
next 4 years to offset these TERRIBLE
injustices we've suffered, the last 7.
  I say, Dukakis is our only path this
January.
 
Wail, that's it for 22!!! Can you
believe it? It was a short one, but
chock
full of great energy. Remember, you
can get back issues real chepe to
spread
out at Grateful Dead shows, Moodie
Blues concerts, etc. Heck, why not
stand out
in front of the post office alongside
your WRL friends and pass em out.
 
  They'll feel supported. hehehehe.
