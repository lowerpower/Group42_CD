(APWN)GROTON, Ct--Cygnus, that weirness character from the comicstrip, Life,
has declared himself the Son of Man,and started his own religion. "Praise
Cyg," they say. "From whom all fluids flow" "Praise him all weirdness cheese
from toes, "Praise Cyg above his mischievous throne,"Praise Cyg when he tries
to play trombone." He has claimed it is not funny. He says he is totally
serious. He promises not to make us drink grape coolaid. When asked for
assurance that the grape coolade trick would not be played, he was heard
saying, "I much prefer cherry."
 
SOVIET HAPPENINGS (APWN)Moscow/Georgia-
-Although the official religion of Soviet Union is atheism, there are a
couple religions flourishing. Orthodox Christianity, and Judaism are quite
strong in Russia and Georgia.
  Most Jews in the Soviet Union have asked for permission to leave. Only a
handful are granted that each year. Upon confession of Christian faith,
a Soviet citizen is required to sign a paper saying, 1) I am Christian 2) I
vow poverty 3) I kick myself out of the party. He will then never get a
promotion at work, the state treats him like garbage, and his peers for the
most part ignore him.
  Despite this, organized religion is quite strong in the soviet union. They
arent making strong statements about abortion, and things like that, but
their main issue in the 1980's has been world peace. They constantly nag at the
Soviet government to go further on human rights. It will be interesting to
see what becomes of the Church when Gorbachev is ousted. Will the church-
bashing be as violent and hatefilled as during Kruschev?  Time will only tell.
1988 was the thousand year anniversity of the Church in Russia, and Gorbachev
had no choice but to allow them to dance in the streets.
   Things are really brewing there. We'll see.

(APWN)LONG ISLAND--Jackie "The Joke Man" Martling, a comedian and radio
personality from East Norwich, New York, has been a professional entertainer
since the age of fourteen. He started playing guitar in a rock and roll band
before the coming of the Beatles, played all thru his schooling at
Michigan State University (Mech. Engineer '71) and continued in a Long
Island-based comedy/original music trio, the now-infamous OffHour Rockers.
  Jackie made the switch to standup in 1979, and started "Use your Finger!! 516
922-wine!!" the worlds only x-rated joke line (516-922-9463), which is
still in operation and gets thousands of calls a day from all over the world.
with the help of his laughline, Jackie has been producing and promoting comedy
shows since the recent boom was in its infancy. Jackie became "The Joke Man"
when his jokeline was picked up by Rick Dees from KIIS-FM in LA for his daily
morning show. "Jackie the Joke Man" is now a regular feature on "Weekly Top 40
Countdown", heard coast to coast in all major markets. Jackie and his
production partner Nancy Sirianni are at work around the clock expanding
their catalogue of videos, albums, cassettes, books, joke cards, t-shirts,
sweatshirts, mugs, and many more hilarious products. Jackie insists that his
family is middle class on a good day, lives on the beautiful North Shore
of Long Island, is incredibly intimidated by just about everything, and sees
more biographies in his future.

THINGS ARE BAD ALL OVER
 
(APWN)Warwick,RI--"Leon was here," says a piece of graffiti on the stall
door of the bathroom of the local IHOP.  IHOP is the only place within 30
feet that's open 24 hours, and the pricesure reflects it. It gets a fierce bar
rush. There's more vomit and assorted other cookie chunks out and around the
toilet than all the queasybags in a 737 on a tuesday afternoon.
  The sink is overflowing, and the mirror is in about 4 different sections from
a 2am fight pitting a teenage crack dealer against a very pissed off vialbuyer
who didnt like the amount of sugar and flour cut into his cocaine. The floor
is filling-in tonite as assistant garbagebucket for the receptical that took
a walk out to visit the shortorder cook.  The large IHOP throwrug is a soggy mes
almost slips over to the doorway as you regain your footing. It doesnt say
"Leon was here", anymore. Someone stole the bathroom door.
 
LOVELOST (APWN)Guyanna--I loved her. I gave her all I had in existance. She was
young.  I was too; but not quite weird enough for her. She needed more. She
needed excitement, I guess.
  Sure, I was exciting but not weird enough for her. I drove an old beat up
Datsun for mileage, and a Chevy pickup for the haul. I guess I just wasnt
sporty enough. She left me for a guy with a bitchin camaro.
 
   ...........
  /  from   /
 /   the   /   March, 1988.
/publisher/    That's when it ended for
......../   me.
 
              My truck totalled, my insurance $2800 a year, my manager
stealing computer sales from me, no girlfriend for a whole month, Citibank
screaming judges, lawyers, and court, the local cable company, and national
telephone company wanting to "talk to me", half a college degree, 21 pounds
of excess fat I cant get rid of, a psychotherapist that doesnt want my body--
she wants my penis. and 80 dollars, and a partridge shitting on me from a
peartree overhead.
  By 1990, I will be installing step-by-step switching systems in the third
world with the US Army. I signed up in July, and will ship by the time you
get this letter. I dont feel good about joining RayGun's Raiders, or Bush's
Broncos for that matter. Or even Duke's Dingalings. But I'm going after
communicatons skills I simply cannot get in college, and surely aren't getting
making sandwiches at 6.50 per hour. I leave ATI in good hands. Your new
publisher will be Fah-Q, and contributing editors are Ground Zero, the 8th
Defendant, ee the Minuteman, Rick Stoddar, Cygnus, Yipster, and Chip, and the
usual bunch of hacks.
  Fah-Q comes to us from Indiana, and says he plans on headquartering in
Providence, Groton, Philly, AND Denver by the year 1991. He's basically taking
us into 1989 with strong footing. That's a lot considering we live in a nation
that hasnt been able to claim strong footing since custer's last stand.
  I'll be fully removed from ATI for 8 weeks while I undergo namecalling,
daily floggings, and practice using various weapons like m-16's and 9mm's.  Not
much different from my usual daytoday
lifestyle. After that I'll try to get mycomputer out to me, so I can come back
on as a strong force within Activist Times Incorporated.
  Good luck Fah-Q, and look out world.  You thought I play rough.

SAVE THAT CARD by INSANE ANGELO WARLORD
                                - -  -
 
  You dial your 800xxx-xxxx to use your card, and get a bad code siren again.
You call it back and sit there for a minute waiting for the operator and let
her put you thru to CS. 3 times it worked. "I payed $60 2 weeks ago, you didnt
journalize it yet?"
  They gave you the benefit of the doubt and reactivated your card,anticipating
their rubberalloy payment.
  No go.
  You gotta fork over at least 100 bills this time or you'll NEVER SEE YOUR
CARD AGAIN.  "Screw that," you tell her, "eat cockatoo ka-ka"
  You'll leave it bad and pay them 5 a month til it's paid off or you die--
whichever comes first.
  If youre thinking of cuttin up that card, and tossing it, dont. That magneeto
strip on the back is a blank key.
  Can you say ATM?
  I knew you could.
  Next time u need to visit your friend or hack a few 4digit pins or
whatever, dont let him leave a key under the doormat: too risky, you dont
know WHAT kind of people would try gaining access to such a room. Insert your
own personal magneeto card. It's not active anymore, but it's still a zipstrip.
That's all they are looking for at the scanner!!! You knew those silly looking
14 digit things were good for something.  Besides, it's good reference in case y
 
  That's it for ATI25!!!
