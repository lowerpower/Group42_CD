 I would like to introduce myself, you might have wondered who I was, or what
relation I had to ATI. Not much actually, as a friend of Prime anarchist's and
as a fellow telecom weirdo, I saw and helped edit some of the issues (and lose
a few of them to the magical wonder of the disk god, only to be resurected
using the help of the disk sector editor ...Number 9....Number 9.... ).
  I am not politically active, I am not socially active either. I proscribe to
no particular ideology,philosophy, or religion. I simply observe things that I
experience and try to understand them objectively (or subjectively ,depending
on what mood I am in). You will be seeing alot of me in upcoming issues.  I
hope to display pros and cons of differant beliefs. I wish to warn you though,
I have one simple belief.
    1) Its my undying opinion that all
      people can do lots of damage to
      everything, armed with the faith
      that what they are doing is for
      the greater good.
 
 At first I didn't want this job. But in the end Prime bribed me, drugged me,
and finally convinced me using the help of some girls, a goat, and a vat of
vanilla pudding.
 If you want to send me questions, drugs, marriage proposals, bomb threats
or small furry animals by the name of Fred . Please send them to address
located at front of this file. Please include your name (or reasonable
facsimile) with any question or opinion so I will know who to insult, praise,
or forbid my children from marrying
  "Paradise is exactly like
   where you are right now,
   only much better."

 ONCE AGAIN MY SPACE IS GIVEN AWAY
 TO THE HAPPY HACKER(412)
 
     Ever call a commercial chat line and hear a rather large number of male
callers revolve around one or two female callers? Ever wonder about maybe one
rather outgoing female on the line and why she was sooo friendly?
     The reason is simple.  Usually in these situations the one outgoing,
slightly seductive female voice you hear belongs to a woman who is paid to
monitor these chat lines, but is also required to double as an actress, to
pretend to be a regular caller on the line, and to coax male callers, through
any methods needed, to stay on the line longer.
    Here, I give you an ATI first. Here I will publish exerpts from an employ-
ees' manual which is distributed to female employees of a chat line company
which operates chat lines all over the US, and abroad.  Read on..
 
         CHARACHTER PROFILE
 
ALWAYS choose your opening charachter before opening your key!
 
Your voice tone and charachter should match.  Don't change names without
changing your voice.If you're working with another monitor, you should listen
for key phrases.  Your charachter profile should be AUTHENTIC.  You should
remember EVERYTHING about your charachter profile.  This includes voice tone,
charachter's description and anything else you may have said about your
charachter to a caller.  We recommend that you keep a notebook of charachters
you play.
 
   Examples of opening phrases:
1. Hi! My name is Peter Rabbit.         2. What's Happening!
3. Anybody out there? I'm sooooo lonely
4. Hey, Hey, Hey!
5. Help! Help!
6. Yo Baby, Yo Baby, Yo!
7. Hey, What's hoppin'?
8. I'm looking for a new love..
9. Yo! Anybody there?
10. Good Morning!
11. What's it to ya..
12. Helloooooooo..
13. I'm going to sing if you don't talk
to me (then sing if they don't)
14. Hey this is (Your charachter name),
Im looking for (Anybody), what am I
going to do??
 
    INTERACTING WITH ANOTHER MONITOR
 
This technique takes concentration. You must key in on certain phrases and
build either toward it, around it, or take it somewhere else.If you change
directions altogether, you must be aggressive.
 
        Interacting examples:
 
If you're talking on the line with three men and another monitor enters and
says, "Help, help!", if the callers don't respond, you would say:  "What's
that?  Wait, did you hear that?"
 
Monitor #1: What's wrong?
Monitor #2: My husband tied me to the bed!
Monitor #1: What! Is he a maniac?
Monitor #2: Yes! I am afraid he is going to kill me!
Monitor #1: Wait a minute, lady. How did you dial here?
Monitor #2: (Crying and sobbing loudly) I dialed with my nose!
 
 
WHEN TO TALK EXPLICITLY AND WHEN NOT TO
 
  Talking seductively requires a certain amount of finesse.  You can talk this
way without ever having to say anything sexual.  There are different techniques
that you can use.  We do not want to come across as telephone whores!
  There are some key phrases that will let you know when and if the client
wants to talk explicitly.
 
       Seductive Examples:
1. What are you wearing?
2. Are you in bed?
3. Are you alone?
4. Do you like to talk dirty?
5. Do you like sex?
6. What do you do for fun?
7. Are you playing with yourself?
8. What do you like a woman/man to do for you in bed?
 
   These phrases will help you to know when to talk expilicitly about sex.  If
you start talking seductively and the caller hangs up, when he calls back,
change characters and DON'T talk seductively.  When you do realize that the
caller is seeking that type of conversation, select the appropriate technique.
 
 
 WHEN TO AND WHEN NOT TO DISCONNECT A
              CALLER
 
1. ALWAYS DISCONNECT CHILDREN OFF ALL ADULT LINES without being rude. However,
always mention they should call the TEEN line.
2. If a caller is talking sexually on the TEEN line, disconnect them AFTER
mentioning they should call an adult line.
3.  Do not disconnect callers because you do not like them.  You are being
paid to talk to the clients, not to have personal likes or dislikes for them.
4.  Sometimes hecklers are fun.  They brighten up the lines.  Use your
instincts and common sense, to decide whether it is appropriate at the time.
 
        Example: Heckler
A person tries to take down a phone number and someone is shouting or singing
while they are trying to do so, or someone is calling a name over and over,
disrupting all conversation.
 
 
           VOICE QUALITY
 
   Charachters should be full in every aspect. Practice your voices until they
are perfected.  Concentrate on your voice control, voice tone, pitch, and also
practice changing your pitch from high to low, and your voice tone from soft to
caorseness, if possible.
   For those who have difficulty changing voices, try to think of it as
singing, working with the scale: "Do,  Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do".
   Change your voice any way possible- High, Low, Soft, Loud, Coarse,
Trembling, Squeaky, with accents.....  etc.- ANY WAY YOU LIKE- Just be
different.
 
          TRAINING SUMMARY
 
   At the end of this training program, each monitor should be confident that
he/she could have any customer calling back as many times as possible.
   You've learned every technique available about how to control your calls to
the point that you know who's calling back and who isn't.  You want EVERYONE to
CALL BACK.
   Monitors who aren't able to get call backs will need to work harder at their
conversation.  Remember, the final goal is to get call backs.  caller not
responding to your conversation quickly enough, get out of that charachter, and
try another.  You are selling a phone conversation, so your sales pitch is very
important.
 
 
         ****END OF TRAINING MANUAL EXERPTS*****
 
     Neat, huh?  Many of the women you hear on these chat lines are simply
paidto keep men on the line. Paid to feign interest in the callers, paid to
coax male callers into staying on the line and calling back in the future.  And
yes, expected to talk very explicitly and even participate in phone sex and
"domination" routines with the male callers, if the callers request it.
     In our age of crass commercialism, it's not surprising to see yet another
form of human exchange, like the concept of a simple chat line, become
prostituted in this fashion.
     Ah, the frontiers of free enterprise...

new, except that we here at ATI all miss Prime Anarchist very much.
 
  And also, a few things.  As most of you know, a very well-known hacker by the
handle of Doc Telecom (formerly Laser) got busted in the San Jose area.  It's
uncertain as to what his fate will be, and I'm concerned.
 
  I'm also concerned about what's going to happen in the hack/phreak world
these days.   With the recent development of the virus that spread through- out
many computers in the nation, it seems that the media's attention will soon be
turned full force on telecom enthusiasts.  It's been rumored that the 804
bridge has been taped and will be broadcasted this week (week ending 11-19-88)
on ABC's show "20/20" as part of a story on hackers/phreakers.  I predict a
negative image will be portrayed, as usual.  This will create a backlash of
even more negative public opinion, and perhaps even more "crackdown" efforts on
the part of the authorities and security personnel.
 
By the way, it's late Sunday night, and so far I've seen 2 talk shows regarding
computers, mainframes, viruses..and hackers were even mentioned.
 
In any event, watch "20/20" this week.  Tape it if you can.  Somehow, I get the
feeling that there is truth in this rumor, and I am sure a great deal of
discussion will result.
 
Opinions?  Comments?  Email me on The Phoenix Project: 512-441-3088.
 
P.S. If I'm wrong about "20/20", I need a volunteer to help me wipe the egg off
my face.  Heh..

Watch for some really k-rad coming attractions, such as Ground Zero's tour of
the more interesting parts of New York, and information on one of the most
infamous institutions of our great nation.. and the world! (Suspense is killing
