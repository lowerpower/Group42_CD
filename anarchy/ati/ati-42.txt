A continuation of ATI41..
 
And now, here's some /<-Rad hacking info from Nightcrawler (516):
 
***************************************************************************
 
       Here are bits 'n pieces of things I thought I'd share with you.
Nothing much...just a little bit of variety.
 
     ()()()()()())()()()()(()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()
     ()    The first piece of info is a short program, called a    ()
     ()    subroutine, that will allow  you access the  various    ()
     ()    disk  accounts that  are part  of AMOS  -- the Alpha    ()
     ()    Micro Operating System.  The program is as follows..    ()
     ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()

;Usage:  XCALL SETLOG, "dev:[p,pn]"

  The above program is usable only from within BASIC.  But first you
  need to create it using the text editor called VUE.  You would type in
  "VUE SETLOG.M68", and type in the program above.  Press your ESC key
  and type "G" to compile the program.  After a short period of time, and
  assuming there are no errors, you'll have a program called SETLOG.SBR,
  which is what you want.  Next step is to enter BASIC by typing that in
  at the prompt.  Next, you should type in this phrase exactly:
 
 XCALL SETLOG, "DSK0:[1,4]"
 
  Now exit it out of BASIC by typing "bye", and if all has gone well, you
  should now be logged into DSK0:[1,4], also known as SYS:.  The account
  can be anything you want, as long as you know what available accounts
  are on the system you are calling into.  This is easily found out by
  typing in MOUNT, which will give you a list of all mounted disks on the
  system.  Follow this up with a PPN ?diskname? and you'll know where to
  start.  The above subroutine is only really needed if an account is
  password protected, which is rare.
 
===========================================================================
 
  Next up, a brief summary of special logon processes for a company called
  CBI, or Credit Bureau Inc.  They have credit reports on a good portion
  of the population.
 
  Step 1> Dial via modem a local CBI number.
  Step 2> Press the "RETURN" key twice.
  Step 3> At the "Please sign on" prompt, respond with a line soemthing
          like this:          999AA-11,ALICE,P.  <------Name or intials
            Membership # -----^     ^---Security code
          Make sure you end the sig-on line with a period (.).
  Step 4> Press "RETURN" after signin.
  Step 5> Wait until the terminal prints "Proceed".
  Step 6> At this point, enter inquiries into the system.  At the minimum,
          you should at least know the name and eith a partial address or
          social security number for the person you are looking up.
          In addition, CBI requires that each line you enter in ends with
          a period.
  Step 7> After finishing, press control-D to exit out.
  Step 8> If any errors occur while doing a lookup, press asterisk (*)
          key for each correction; this takes the place of the DEL key.

Last, but not least, a qucik tutorial about a Blue Cross Unix system...
 
[a]  Get connected and wait 10 secs, at which time the familiar "login:"
prompt will appear.  Enter in the ID and password.  Remember to be in
lower case, and that the password will not echo to your screen.
 
[b]  If everything is cool, you should see:  "UNIX 3B2".  After that, any
messages from Blue Cross will appear.  Based upon your log ID, a line pops
up saying..."YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS TO READ THIS MESSAGE." Normal billing
replies and remittances are sent to the screen.
 
[c]  About 2-3 minutes later, after all the messages have stopped being
displayed, another message shows up:  "YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED TWO FILES".
Then the '$' prompt appears, and you are now at the OS level.  I haven't
played around with this too much (been too busy).
 
[d]  If you want to erase any of the claims that were sent to you, type
in "rcln" to delete the files.  The blue cross system will pause for a
few seconds, and the $ will come back.
 
[e]  When you want to submit claims (why?), type in "tmgr 14000", and send
whatever you want to be sent to blue cross.  The message "THE 3B2 IS NOW
READY FOR YOUR TRANSMISSION" is the key to look for.
 
[f]  To exit off the system, just type in "logoff", and the blue cross CPU
will say "GOODBYE!!!" and disconnect you.  Note: The claims submission
process will automatically disconnect you, so make that your last option!

Here's something from my BBS, The Red Phone (201-748-4005).  A user on my BBS
just moved up here to NJ from Texas, and here are some of his thoughts after
someone on my bbs made a reference to "fucking texans":

**I'M** one of the "FUCKING TEXAN'S", and let me tell you..
Here is just one example...
I went into a Safeway (a local grocery store chain) and asked for a
"check cashing card".   They gave it to me and asked if I wanted top
cash a check.   HELL YES!  Sure, I didn't have any money in my account,
but what the hell, right?  I'll pay it later (and I have..).  Three times
I went back to safeway and cashed **BAD** checks.  And Ive paid every
one of them since..  NOW.....yes...  *NOW* I'm up east.
 
To get a check card at my local A&P, I have to fill out this form and I
get my little card in the mail (Postmaster, do not forward).  I went to
a bank with a $900 check in my hot little hands to open an account
(they had an ATM, my bank didn't), what happend?  They wanted
(get this) a fucking ***CREDIT CARD**** before they would even open
a ***FUCKING CHECKING ACCOUNT****.  What the hell is wrong with you
people up here?
 
I go to the grocery store and what do I see?????????????
Fucking barricades so I can't take my shopping cart full of $110 worth
of groceries to my car.   I've been ALL OVER Texas and have yet
to see a grocery store with that kind of security.
 
WHAT's my point?  You ass-holes up here have let it happen to you!
Why didn't anyone protest when the local stores put up barricades
to keep you from taking your groceries to you car, not the other
way around?  What are you fucking yankees?  Stupid?
This would ***********NEVER************* go over in Texas.
The store would go out of business.
 
That's all, reread it and capture it.  I'm pissed..

Here's another post from a user in Argentina (further south, no doubt..):
 
From: ALBERT FISCHER

Wow! Ground Zero..can't believe what I read! You understand me!!
To The Prophet: I am not against the US, but I am against them exploiting our
people.  Anyway, there are few people here that can enjoy computers and techno-
logy.  Im one of the lucky ones. But.. most Argentinians are not! And they work
10-12 hr a day just to earn $50 us per month!!! And that's EXPLOITING! true
that we depend on US and Europe, but it's true too, that we have no chance to
get out of this situation, because YOU and europe regulate the world prices for
everything we produce. The US and Europe don't wish us to be Japan or Germany,
or someting like this....they just want us where we are. Because...you need
that cheap workers to make difference which you invest in more and more tech-
nology. So please stop talking of the billions spent in help. That billions are
not help, that's because we worked so long, and what we need to not die from
starvation, so you can continue with this silly game....like IBM, i.e. Why do
you think there is an IBM factory in Argentina? In USA they must pay at least
$1000 a month for each worker..here..it's OK to pay $50 a month, but it's not
enough to sustain a whole family of 4 or 5 members....but...anyway, that's not
YOUR problem, as all the Americans say... It's simple, they say, they can't pay
more, because there would not be profits for them.... and that is a great LIE!!
IBM was the greatest exporter last year....
This is a game where two players are needed. One rich player, and one poor
player. If the poor player DIES, the rich one can't keep playing, and winning.
They can't keep selling their technology, and they can't continue exploiting
the other people.
 
The same would happen if the poor one goes socialist..Why do you think there
are thousands of contras in Honduras and Nicaragua? Just for fun?.....KILLING
PEOPLE THAT DO NOT WANT TO WORK FOR THE U.S.!!!!
 
A.F.
 
 
Right on, Albert!!!!!!!

Here's the address on some firm that sells a product which is supposed to make
last night's joint undectable by a urine test.  I haven't written for info, so
I guess just write to them and ask them for info or a catalog:
 
Zydot Unlimited

Tulsa, OK 74151-0485
 
There's a new chat system in New York. After Oct 1st there will be a monthly
fee to access it, but it won't be much. There are a lot of cyberpunks hanging
around on it, so call it at 212-721-0338 at 1200 baud..

That's all for ATI42.... Look for ATI43 soon! It'll be stupendous!
 
As usual ;)  .............
