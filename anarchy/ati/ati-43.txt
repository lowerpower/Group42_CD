Hi folks. First up, it's Prime Anarchist with Prime Anarchist World News:
 
p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*
 
PRIME ANARCHIST PRODUCTIONS Presents ATI, now a GZP - in case you didn't know
that already. PAP, Activist Times Inc. and Ground Zero Productions all come
under the same umbrella (but we're not trying to sell you insurance - just
share some ideas).
 
     "Check out special billing options....like accounting codes. These codes
are dialed with the call (usually 2 digits). Calls come back summarized by
code.
     "One warning: most accounting codes are not 'restrictive', i.e. calls
will go through for any 2 digits dialed, so this is not a good way to control
abuse."
     See possibilities there? I do. Adding 2 digits to a 14-digit Sprint or
MCI card could force 17 calls to the same place to take up 17 lines. So
--instead of your bill showing 17 calls to Oshkosh, Wyoming for a total of so
many minutes, there will be 17 lines for those calls.  In other words, do a
random number each time (99 possibilities for each call dialed) and the bill
will come home in a box.
     Looooooooooove that paper trail!
     Best prank I've heard of so far?
     23 year-old Joseph Mulcahey tried to withdraw money at his local bank.
     Suddenly, police showed up and took him away. He says he had no idea
someone days before scribbled "Give me $10,000. I have a gun." on the back of
a withdrawal slip and put it back in the middle of the stack at the bank's
table.
     Dweezil hotline: dial 818-PUM-PKIN.
     A real "war-on-drugz" would have to involve alcohol, tobacco, caffeine,
valium, phenobarbitol, and many other substances. What we have before us is a
witch hunt. I think Bush is going to "Blow his Wod".
     Book review: "Loyalties" by Carl Bernstein. Carl tackles the issue of
having a mom and dad who joined the Communist party. More than just commies,
Mr. and Mrs. Bernstein were hard workers in the labor movement. Joining the
Communist party just helped them getting around.
     AROUAH!!!
     I.D. trick of the month: Go to East Germany as a tourist. Get their
version of a white card. Flock to West Germany as a "refugee".
     West Germany is flooded with newbies. They'll give you instant citizenship
, hence credentials.
     Don't worry about the heavy American accent. Everyone speaks fluent
English except us anyways.

     I be gone.
     Bye bye.
     NO CARRIER.

                      --- The Roving Eavesdropper---
 
We got a lot of compliments on the story called "Terrorism of a 976 Phone Sex
Line" in ATI37. And the chat buffer in ATI34 got a lot of laughs, too. So, ATI
will now have a new occasional feature called "The Roving Eavesdropper", where
we will bring you possible conversations that possibly took place over the
phone, over the modem (via buffers), or even in person.  We bring you this
feature to represent reality. To show you humorous sides of human interaction
that are normally not encountered. To just have some fun!!!
 
So, in this issue we bring you a buffer from a chat system called Diversi-Dial.
Diversi-Dial, or D-Dial as it is commonly referred to, is a 300-baud chat
system run on an Apple computer and 7 modems and phone lines. It seems to
sometimes attract a more interesting variety of individuals, as we will see
now.
 
When a + is shown, it means someone is had logged on. A - indicates someone
logged off. Users who do not have a password (they cost between $5-$15 per
month) have a time limit of 5 minutes on the system. The callers in this
instance were all non-password holders, so you will see a lot of logging on and
logging off, including the signons and signoffs of the person who buffered this
fascinating conversation.
                                        A /s gives a list of users online. So wh
a short list. And any line beginning with P was a private message to the user
who buffered this.
                                        Anyway, on with the show:

Wasn't that special? Look in ATI44 for a great story called "Typical
Converstion Heard at a Suburban Mall". It'll knock your socks off!!

Now for a special announcement:
 
 
RC Cola drinkers, unite.
Boycott Pepsi.
 
     Wayne Calloway, Pepsico's Chairman also sits of Exxon's Bored of
Directors. Exxon and Pepsi are both bad on the First Ammendment (not to
mention the environment! -GZ). Pepsico's address is Purchase, NY 10577; fone
number is 914-253-2000.
 
Suggestions:
 
1. Light up their switchboard.
2. Tear up your Exxon card.
3. Don't buy Exxon gas or other products.
4. Tape or crazy-glue all Pepsi vending machines.
5. Write "Pepsi Boycott" in the street in front of major sidewalk promotions.
6. Jam Pepsi ads on your local TV station (We're not in the Max Headroom days
yet! -GZ)
7. Buy your grocer's homemade colas.
8. Get the Coke recipe and brew your own.
9. Start drinking iced tea.
10. Hijack a Pepsi truck and and drive it off a cliff (dress up like an Indian
or a Coke deliveryman).
11. Call your operator and pose this rhetorical question: "On your next break
will you drink a Pepsi, which stands for censorship, or will you participate
in the boycott?"
 
So next time you want to make the choice of a New Generation, pop open a Royal
Crown.
 
GZ's note: Don't forget other Pepsi products, like Slice. If in doubt, check
the can or label.

And now, a story from the 10-17-89 issue of The Sun. For all you Trekkies like
me! Read it and laugh:
 
Hundreds of Trekkies Shave Their Heads to Look Like Captain Picard--
 
            (Typed in from a tabloid called THE SUN)
 
     The next generation of trekkies has had it with the fake Vulcan ears of
Mr. Spock --they're shaving their heads to look like Captain Picard!
     Bald heads are popping up all over the country as more and more
spaced-out STAR TREK fans pay tribute to the skinhead Enterprise captain of
TV's STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.
     "STAR TREK isn't just a TV show, it's a way of life", says bald Kevin
Johnson, 23. "And Captain Picard is the best example of what the Enterprise
crew stands for.
     "Shaving your head is the ultimate test for a Trekkie to show his
allegiance."
     While older STAR TREK fanatics are free to do what they want with thier
hair, parents are alarmed that growing numbers of young children are taking
razors to their scalps.
     Mad mom Marlene Peterson forbid her 10-year old son Gary from watching
his favorite show when he arrived at the breakfast table sporting a Captain
Picard top.
     "I could have dropped dead", she recalls.
     "He had used his father's electric razor the night before and shaved off
every hair.
     "When I screamed at him he just shrugged and said all the kids were doing
it."
     STAR TREK has always had a large group of steadfast loyal fans who'll go
to amazing extremes to imitate their heroes.
     But according to Dr. Louise Fitzgibbon, a top psychologist who has
studied the phenomenon, Captain Picard is an especially attractive role model.
     "He is very dedicated and professional", she says.
     "Although he seems unemotional on the surface, he will make any sacrifice
for his crew.
     "To devoted trekkies, he is the man of the future, and for them, shaved
heads are the final frontier."

Now for a great poem I saw in Environmental Action magazine:
 
 
          WHAT KING GEORGE SAYS
 
"It's sweet and it doesn't have any of that stuff theey spray on the apples"
 
        -George Bush, on why he drinks carrot juice (Newsweek, March 27, 1989)
 
He ought to know,
head of a government that
okays carcinogens on
our apples, grapes and
other produce.
Friend of Uniroyal, which makes Alar.
Buddy of the fruit and vegetable cartels.
Overseer of comprador governments that
spray DDT on their own field hands.
 
Carrot juice, though less dangerous,
is not cheap, nor available in Safeway,
Kroger or Winn-Dixie.
It's the juice of those who know,
those who can afford to shop
in gourmet health food stores.
 
As for the masses, King George says:
LET 'EM EAT ALAR
 
                  -- Bob Slaymaker
 
Alar is a ripening agent used mainly on apples and is a known carcinogen.
And it looks like the masses ARE going to eat Alar. The federal government is
buying out a 15-million surplus created when the serious effects of Alar became
widely publicized. These apples will be distributed to the poor. They will not
be tested for Alar content.
 
==============================================================================
 
A major quake happened in Northern California, affecting San Francisco,Oakland,
San Jose and other cities. I hope the people affected get the best help
possible. At least ol' Bush was kind enough to declare the area a disaster
area, and federal aid will soon follow.
 
That's all for ATI43. See you on the dark side of the moon!
