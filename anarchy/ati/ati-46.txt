Howdy! Welcome to ATI46. I know it's been a while. But, we should be getting
on a regular schedule from now on.. like every 2 weeks or so. Thanks for all
of your support in the recent months. ATI's readership has been growing, and
we've been getting a lot of positive feedback. Keep the comments, positive
and
negative, coming!
 
This issue brings some new contributors, namely Sk8 The Skinhead (313) and
TI-Man (201). Look for their contributions later in upcoming issues!
 
Also, we are happy to announce the return of a BBS run by The Mentor of LOD
called The Phoenix Project. It's an excellent board that I highly reccomend.
Call it at 512-441-0229 for the most stimulating discusion of computer and
telecom-related subjects!
 
Speaking of BBSs.. here is a partial list of boards that you can find ATI on.
 
Give these great boards a call!

We
are also expecting to be on quite a few more international BBSs.
 
We don't know exactly where ATI is getting to, but these are the places that
we know ATI is getting uploaded regularly to. In the next few weeks I will
attept to compile a more complete list of boards that have ATI issues. And of
 
course, it goes without saying that if you have ATI issues, please do upload
them to any boards you call!
 
Also, we are now offering full sets of ATI issues to anyone who wants them.
Just send us $1.00 to cover postage and give us an address, and we will mail
you a full set of ATI issues for you to enjoy (and upload to your local
boards!). If you already have some issues, then tell us which ones you don't
have (issues 1-46) and we will send you them. The disks can be sent in the
following formats: Commodore, Amiga, IBM MS-DOS, and Atari-ST. All disks are
3 1/2" size, unless you have a Commodore. If you have a Commodore, we can
send
you the files on a 3 1/2" disk or 5 1/4" disks. Please do take advantage of
this offer, as we want to get as many people reading ATI as possible. We
would
definitely like to hear from any and all BBS sysops that have the space to
put
up our issues! (issues 1-46 together make up about 500k)
 
You can also get ATI issues through Bitnet. Just mail tk0eee1@NIU and you
will
be mailed ATI thru the net!
 
And now, on with the show!

And now, here's P.A.W.N.:
 
    DONDE ESTA MI CHINGADA SALADA. It's time for more prime. Prime Anarchist
World News. PAWN is brought to you by ATI in conjunctivitis with Murine and
Minolta. Famous for getting the red out.
    I saw a show on cable TV for deprived people called "Bowling for Gas
Money
to Get Home".
    Fone area codes for 5 bodies of water (I'm not kidding). 873 gets you
the
Indian Ocean; 872 is the Pacific, 871 is the Atlantic, Carribean and
Mediterranean. Call your favorite oil tanker guy (and guess what?!?! 9 times
 
out of 10? Step-X!!!)
    GOOD KING GEORGE'S FREUDIAN SLIP-- Discussing an executive order
charging
27 prominent people with taking a "drug initiative", George said, "They all
share my goal of ridding Americans, er, uh, America of illegal drugs."
    PAP GOES DECLASSIFIED: the phollowing info has been declassified from
PAP's
phun philez:
    Some of PA's aliases from 1981-1987:
Yipster, Noriega, Pie Guy, Mud Yuppy, Infomaniack, The Infomaniack, Infoman,
 
The Infoman, Rad Dood, B. Badass, Pro Tester, Anarchist, The Anarchist, NRK,
 
PA, TPA, Prime Guy, PG, and Anne R. Chisolm. More info there'll come later.
    The GOD pasword to the online game HACKIT (c)1987-88 was "Run N. Gun".
Closest attempts at that were Run A Gun and Buy A Gun. Congrats and thanx to
 
all who put up with and frequented Infomaniack BBS while the game was being
developed. It was a smashing (crashing???) success only due to your email
and
feedback. Anyone who wants information on purchasing a copy of Hackit or
photo-
copying the t-files can kiss my jolly gym shorts.
    I like strawberry nectar better than peach or apricot nectar. Try it.
    God, I wish the Cleopatra look would die already. If you don't have
black
hair naturally, do us all a favor?
    Don't try.
    Whether you think "cherish" by madonna is cherishable or perishable, I
say
throw it out.
    Having troble discerning a touch-tone or series of touch-tones you've
recorded? Play the tones into any Aspen voice-mail system. It will spit the
decoded numbers back to you as part of an error message. Or play the tomes
into
the Bell Labs wakeup call at 201-644-2306. Or play them to an SSCU. Or if
you
own an Apple-Cat modem you can boot up a prg that will recognize and decode
the
touch-tomes.

------->poetry corner-------->
 
first a poem by ground zero:
 
    **To Juan**
 
On a planet
On which life is cheap
You epitomiz the tragedy
of a single wasted life.
 
What led to the exit?
Solitude? Fear? Confusion?
I suppose solitude led
to fear and confusion....
 
If you'd offer'd someone a glimpse
of your heart-
Could this end have been
averted?
 
So what of your lost future?
What of the event of an individual
being pushed
to end his days?
What of the collective?
 
We have failed.
Miserably.
 
 
  ARMAGEDDON ISLE
  TO THE TUNE OF: Gilligin's Isle...
It all started when we tried to smoke
A joint that was too fat.
We smoked it from beginning to end
In 30 seconds flat.
Them buds they crackled
'n' seeds all popped as
Paper inched across.
I noticed that my head was getting
High as a kite.
High as a kite.
 
The thoughts grew few and far between,
the topics were of peace.
If not for the US and our secret wars
The whole world would be free.
The whole world would be free.
 
So then the others turned to me
And this is what one said.
  We can have peace,
  And Freedom too,
  Equality,
  And justice.
 
But the movie star
Is a war monger and greedy bastard.
Here on Armageddon Isle.
Here on Raygun's Isle.
Here on Bush's Isle.
 
 
TO THE TUNE OF "CHESTNUTS ROASTING"
Flame broiled Whoppers in
a cardboard box.
French fries sizzling in fat.
Eat them fast or they're soggy and flat
Burger King is where it's at.
 
You know that Herb is on his way.
And his whole entire ad campaign is gay
Even though, they do it your way,
It still costs too much for
     steroid sandwiches these days.
 
 
 
        and now,
        a poem
       by prime
War?
Local or far away-
Will it ever go away.
I draw a peace sign in the sand,
A crab bites my toe.
I let him go.
The woe of aftermath--
Can we hang?
