ATI's Insane Staff:

     Ground Zero - publisher, editor, writer
     Prime Anarchist - editor, writer
     Writing/Research Staff - Sk8 the Skinhead, Fah-Q, MAC???, Happy Harry
     Hardon, Stormbringer, and other occasional contributors.
     Archivist: Llo    

 
     Hello. Welcome to ATI51.  First off, I apologize for all the typos 
in ATI49 and ATI50. We'll try to better this time ;) .
     I would like to welcome all of the new ATI readers that have been 
added to our net distribution list.  We acquired these new readers due to
a piece written by Prime and myself that was run in the Computer Underground
Digest (CuD).  Any reader who has any comments or contributions, or would
just like to say hi, email me at:
           ...uunet!tronsbox!akcs.groundzero
     Those of you who expressed an interest in writing for ATI may send in
their contributions by typing them out and emailing me the text at the 
above address.  Anyone who does not have a net address may type out their
piece in hardcopy (handwrite it if you have to as long as it's readable)
and send it to me at the above ATI's PO Box address. Submissions can range
in size from one paragraph to about 15k. We will consider articles larger
than 15k, but send a brief outline first before submitting the actual piece.
     A warm welcome also goes out to two new regular contributors: Happy
Harry Hardon (anyone see "Pump Up The Volume"?) and Stormbringer.  You'll
be seeing items from them every so often.
     Also, some corrections and updates on items in ATI49/50. Ripco BBS is
back up, under a much smaller system with a file area and one message base. 
The sysop, Dr. Ripco, has stated that the "new Ripco" is not meant to replace
the system as it was before Sun Devil, but exists mainly as a means for
interested parties to keep in touch. Call it at 312-528-5020.
     In our review of other interesting publications, we neglected to 
mention CuD (although we have written it up in a previous issue). It is an
online newsletter dedicated to reporting items about the computer underground
and any issues relevant to computer use, first ammendment rights of computer
users, and more. CuD is a professional journal and provides valuable 
information in a well-written, concise format.  To get on their distribution
list, email them at: tk0jut2@NIU.BITNET.
     Now, as always, let's start out with Prime Anarchist and his column,
Prime Anarchist World News:

turn of back on national tv, told both sides of the gaza strip (dont ask
for an 8 oz gaza strip (medium-well) at a kosher restaurant.) "our fone #
is still 1-202-456-1414. If you feel like talking about peace sometime,
give us a call." Now, I'm not saying we should continue our orgiatic
lovemaking with either side but we've been in bed with Israel for 42 years
now, and mother earth has stayed-together-at-her-seams so far DESPITE all
our efforts to plunder, pillage and petrify. You know what the Bible says
about cursing Israel? Uh oh...
    Welp, that's about it for now. Tune in next week when Prime interviews
a friend of a friend of a real beatnik. We'll have more phun #'s, and we'll
bring you "all the viewz that fits in a bag lady's shopping cart".

-------------------> random notes from ground zero------------------>

     "Hi. Welcome to the free white party line," chimed the introduction
to a free-access party line in 702 that no longer exists. White party 
line? Hmm. I later learned that the same company that set that line up had
another line up that introduced itself as the "free black party line". Why
the "segregation"? You might also notice a lot of 1-900, 976, and other
premiun toll chat lines conduct the same practice. They set up regualr party
lines, but also set up other lines "for soul sisters and brothers" or "for
soul companions", etc. Apparently the world "soul" is meant to indicate 
that these lines were intended for black callers. I thought segregation 
was to become a thing of the past, but with things like these lines existing,
it might not any time soon.
     Speaking of 900 numbers, another practice is bugging me: the practice
of setting up 900 numbers that charge anywhere from 70 cents to a few bucks
just to enter a sweepstakes or contest. I see plenty of commercials for
on TV. Now, it's the law that a sweepstakes has to have a "no purchase 
necessary to enter" policy. But companies running these things are getting
around this by having commercials that repeat the 900 entry number over and
over, but only flash the "no purchase necessary" mail-in address momentarily
without allowing enough time for it to be written down, in hopes that most
people will call the 900 number and pay to enter instead of trying to write
the address down. Meanwhile, these companies, and 900 leasers are raking
the money in. A dishonest practice.
     Did anyone ever watch "Alien Nation" before it was cancelled by Fox? 
It was a great show - as good as "Star Trek" or "Beauty and the Beast". If 
anyone knows anything "Alien Nation" maybe coming back or going under 
syndication, let me know!
     If a movie called "King of New York" is playing in your area, go see it.
The plot is definitely thought-provoking. It's another movie that makes the
viewer think about organized crime, criminals, and their role in society.

THE ROVING EAVESDROPPER 

     We have an occaional column in ATI called The Roving Eavesdropper in
which we present possible phone conversations, buffers, in-person communiques
or other interesting phenomena. We do this in order to represent other 
forms of reality, to educate our readers..or just to have some good clean
fun!

     In this issue, we proudly present:


                      "Fun and Chaos on a Conference Bridge"

     It was a slow evening on the conference bridge, a dial-in conference
line owned by a private company which was sometimes borrowed by hacker types
to hold their own conferences.  Although the number to bridge was widely 
known within hacker circles, there weren't many caller that early evening.
     "Hey, anyone got any good codes?", asked on unknown voice.
     The caller's request was met by silence.  Finally, after a long pause, 
another voice spoke up.
     "Shut the hell up with that shit, man," growled Brutus, a regular caller
who disguised his voice to sound like a Black man, although most of the
callers knew he was white.  "We don't need no talk about codes on here."
     "Hey," protested the first voice, "I'm calling this thing direct and I
need something-"
     "Then why don't you just wait until you get something to call with
before you call? Who says you have to call here now anyway?" yelled Brutus, 
interrupting him.
     "Well, I'm supposed to meet someone here now," said the first voice.
     "Who you meeting here?" demanded Brutus. "Who are you anyway? What's
your handle?"
     "This is Pyro. I'm waiting for-"
     "Oh yeah, I heard you the other night, man. You waiting for that other
lamer Terminator. What are you lamers gonna do anyway? Trade some cool warez
or what?" shouted Brutus, once again interrupting Pyro.
     "Lame, lame, lame!!!" cried out an extremely high-pitched voice that 
sounded like it was induced by helium.
     "Hey, who that? Is that Squeaky again?" asked Brutus.
     "Yeah, this is Squeaky! Some people on this bridge are lame, lame,
lame!!!" cried Squeaky in his 2600hz voice. "Hey, I'm gonna play you all a
song! Here we go!!!"
     Squeaky proceeded to play a song on his touch tones, and soon other
callers proceeded to repeat the song. As the "song" was being repeated, 
several tones were heard, indicating that a few more callers were on the
line.
     "Hey, what's going on..." greeted one voice.
     "Is Doc on here?" inquired another.
     Soon, the bridge was filled with several different voices all talking
at once, clicking out on their 3-way calling, hitting touch tones, and 
shouting.  However, above the confusion a professional-sounding male voice 
was barely audible.
     "ATS Long Distance, this is Rob, how may I help you?"
     "ATS? ATS?!?!?! You work for ATS," asked Brutus as the bridge grew 
silent.
     "Yes, sir," said Rob. "How may I help you?"
     "Hey, I got something to tell you!" exclaimed Brutus.  "I found a 
calling card out on the sidewalk, I went over to the corner to use it, and 
it said, 'Please dial a valid calling card number'. Now what you gonna do
about that?"
     "Well, sir, I think it might be helpful to set up your own ATS calling
card number. I'd be happy to help you with that if you like," said Rob.
     At that point, total mayhem spread across the bridge.  Callers started
hitting touch tones, clicking out on their three-way calling, shouting and
cat-calling Rob.
     "Hey, I think ATS rips people off," shouted on caller.
     "ATS sucks! Their security is lame!" screamed another.
     "Just what am I connected to? Is this some sort of party line?" 
asked Rob.
     Squeaky decided to join in the anarchy. "Hey, I've got something to
say...
 ..I've got something to say..I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY!!!" cried Squeaky 
until there was silence.  "I'm going to blow up ATS!!!"
     "Nah, nah..," said Brutus. "We not gonna blow up ATS. Just the parking
lot."
     "Word, word, word," chorused everyone on the bridge spontaneously.
     A barely audible click was heard on the bridge, most likely the being
the caller who originally connected Rob on his 3-way disconnecting him.
     "Hey, is that guy from ATS still here?" asked someone.
     "Nah, he gone," stated Brutus.
     "He's gone!" echoed Squeaky.
     "Just having some fun man, just having some fun," said Brutus with a 
mischievous twist in his voice.
     The night had just begun....

   Ground Zero and Happy Harry Hardon & reviews of the new (cough) TV season:


Cop Rock:
--- ----

GZ: I'd hate to say that name fast. Might result in an embarassing Freudian
slip.

HHH: Hey, that gives me an idea. Someone could make a porno version of that
show. 

GZ: A porno musical cop show? 

HHH: They could do it. I once saw a porno that was a spoof of a cop show. It
had two female officers, Gagme and Layme. It was a spoof of Cagney and Lacey.

GZ: I know, I know.. Hey, we're getting off the subject. Did you like the
show, Harry?

HHH: Yeah, I liked it. But I don't know why. It's a weird feeling.

GZ: I feel the same way. I like it, but I'm not sure why. I usually bust
out laughing when they break into their
musical numbers. I think they must have the words "YOU WILL LIKE THIS SHOW"
interspliced between frames of the show while it's airing. What do you think?

HHH: Sounds reasonable. Beware of masonic mind control techniques!


Lenny:
-----

GZ: Total sham. We all know that all blue collar men plop down on the couch
and demand a beer when they get home from work. Boring.

HHH: Boring. Hey, get me a beer, GZ.


Gabriel's Fire:
--------- ----   

GZ: Interesting. Nice photography. Has potential. They have to come up with
more interesting plots, though.

HHH: It was ok. But it needs more car chases, guns, and bombs.


Babes:
-----

GZ: I liked the commercial for the show. 2 or 3 skinny, made-up bimbos from
hell stand there tossing their teased heair when the floor opens up under
them and the big "babes" sitting on a couch get lowered down. Funny show. 

HHH: But how did they get a couch that could all of them without breaking?


Earth Farce oops.. um, Earth Force:
----- -----            ----- -----

GZ: What a disappointment. The show is poorly put together and therefore
doesn't deliver the appropriate message. It seems more like a James Bond 
007-type show that a show that's supposed to promote environmental awareness.

HHH: Well, it wasn't that bad. I think that oceanographer lady's hot! Anyway
they may get their act together a little better.  Plus the fact that the 
show even exists will get people thinking about the environment, and
hopefully, to treat it better.

+ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Wow. That's about it for now. Look for more great info on ATI52 very soon!

To obtain back issues of ATI, call BBS's such as the TAP bbs at 502-499-8933
or Ripco at 312-528-5020, or access ATI's ftp site at 128.95.136.2 and 
enter 'cd /tmp/ftp/ATI' . Or, send a 3.5 inch disk to our PO Box and specify
your computer type: Amiga, IBM Compat., Macintosh, Atari ST, or Commodore
(they are available on 5 1/4" disks for Commodores as well as 3.5").

FLASH: Doc Holiday says he will continue to put out his online newsletter
under the Phrack name. I guess we'll see how it all goes, eh?  Look for
Phrack #32 sometime in December. A "best of phrack"-type issue might also
be coming out soon.  

See ya! ;)
