        FREE CANDY, SNACKS, COINS, TOKENS AND OTHER FINE MATERIAL.

        We all know those snack machines, coin machines, soda machines that 
allow dollar bills to be excepted.  Here is a quick and easy way get all
of those items for free and sometimes also making money at the same time.
All you need is a dollar bill and a long strip of clear tape (you will want
it to be the width of the dollar).  What you do is at the very end of the 
dollar bill is tape an end of the tape to it and then fold the tape in half
(the long way).  So it should sort of look like this, a long section of 
tape (around 6 to 8 inches long) folded so it is the smooth side
and not the sticky side attached to the end of a dollar bill.  Now,
stick the dollar end of the bill into the dollar slot.  The dollar will go
in with part of the tape (there should be enough tape left for you to be
holding on to).  Now pull the tape out along with the dollar bill.  The 
machine thinks that you paid a dollar so now make a selection.  You 
should be able to get the candy or whatever along with the change.  So,
you end up with a candy and 50 cents in change for nothing!  This 
works the best on Lance Snack machines but feel free to trhy it on others
too.  If you are a little confused on how this should look feel free to 
take a look at the picture that I made using .GIF format called 
candy.gif.

        GOOD LUCK,
        MARXMAN
