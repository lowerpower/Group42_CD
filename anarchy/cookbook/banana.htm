      Bananas                                courtesy of the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>          Believe  it  or  not,  bananas  do contain a small quantity of
          _Musa Sapientum bananadine_, which is  a  mild,  short-lasting
          psychedelic.  There  are much easier ways of getting high, but
          the great advantage to this method is that bananas are legal.

<BR>          1) Obtain 15 lbs. of ripe yellow bananas.
<BR>          2) Peel all 15 lbs. and eat the fruit. Save the peels.
<BR>          3) With a sharp knife, scrape off the insides of the peels and
          save the scraped material.
<BR>          4) Put all of the scraped material in  a  large  pot  and  add
          water.  Boil  for  three to four hours until it has attained a
          solid paste consistency.
<BR>          5) Spread this paste on cookie sheets, and dry in an over  for
          about  20  minutes  to a half hour. This will result in a fine
          black powder. Makes about  one  pound  of  bananadine  powder.
          Ususally one will feel the effects of bananadine after smoking
          three or four cigarettes.
