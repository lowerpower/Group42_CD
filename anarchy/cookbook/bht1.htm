<BR>Hacking Tutorial                       Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>What is hacking?
<BR>----------------
<BR>According to popular belief the term hacker and hacking was founded at mit
it comes from the root of a hack writer,someone who keeps "hacking" at
the typewriter until he finishes the story.a computer hacker would be
hacking at the keyboard or password works.

<BR><BR>What you need:
<BR>--------------
<BR>To hack you need a computer equipped with a modem (a device that lets you
transmit data over phone lines) which should cost you from $100 to $1200.

<BR><BR>How do you hack?
<BR>----------------
<BR>Hacking recuires two things:
<BR>1. The phone number
<BR>2. Answer to identity elements
<BR><BR>How do you find the phone #?
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>There are three basic ways to find a computers phone number.
<BR>1. Scanning,
<BR>2. Directory
<BR>3. Inside info.

<BR><BR>What is scanning?
<BR>-----------------
<BR>Scanning is the process of having a computer search for a carrier tone.
For example,the computer would start at (800) 111-1111 and wait for carrier
if there is none it will go on to 111-1112 etc.if there is a carrier it
will record it for future use and continue looking for more.

<BR><BR>What is directory assictance?
<BR>-----------------------------
<BR>This way can only be used if you know where your target computer is. For
this
example say it is in menlo park, CA and the company name is sri.

<BR><BR>1. Dial 411 (or 415-555-1212)
<BR>2. Say "Menlo park"
<BR>3. Say "Sri"
<BR>4. Write down number
<BR>5. Ask if there are any more numbers
<BR>6. If so write them down.
<BR>7. Hang up on operator
<BR>8. Dial all numbers you were given
<BR>9. Listen fir carrier tone
<BR>10. If you hear carrier tone write down number, call it on your modem and
your
    set to hack!
