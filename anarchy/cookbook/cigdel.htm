Delay Igniter from a Cigarette                       by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     A simple and economical (everyone wants to save money haha) time
delay can be made with a common cigarette.

<BR><BR>Materials Required:
<BR>------------------

<BR>Cigarette
<BR>Paper match
<BR>String (shoelace or similar cord)
<BR>Fuse cord (improvised or commercial)

<BR><BR>Procedure:
<BR>---------

<BR>1) Cut end of fuse cord at a slant to expose inner core
<BR>2) Light cigarette in normal fashion. Place a paper match so that the had
is over exposed exposed end of fuse cord and tie both to the side of the
burning cigarette with string.
<BR>3) Position the burning cigarette with fuse so that it burns freely. A
suggested method is to hang the delay on a twig.

<BR><BR>Note: Common dry cigarettes burn about 1 inch every 7 or 8 minutes in
still air. (Now I am talking about all except American brands, which burn
about 1 inch every 4-5 minutes) If the fuse cord is place one inch from
the burning end of the cigarette a time delay of 7 or 8 minutes will
result.
<BR><BR>      Delay time will vary depending upon type of cigarette, wind,
moisture, and other atmospherc conditions (get to know your cigarette!)
<BR><BR>      To obtain accurate delay time, a test run should be made under
"use" conditions.
