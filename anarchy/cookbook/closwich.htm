Clothespin Switch                           by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     A spring type clothespin is used to make a circuit closing switch to
actuate explosive charges, mines, booby traps, and alarm systems.

<BR><BR>Material Required:
<BR>-----------------

<BR>Spring type clothespin
<BR>Sold copper wire -- 1/16 in. (2 mm) in diameter
<BR>Strong string on wire
<BR>Flat piece of wood (roughly 1/8 x 1" x 2")
<BR>Knife

<BR><BR>Procedure:
<BR>---------

<BR>1) Strip four in. (10 cm) of insulation from the ends of 2 solid copper
wires. Scrape the copper wires with pocket knife until the metal is
shiny.
<BR>2) Wind one scraped wire tightly on jaw of the clothespin, and the other
wire on the other jaw.
<BR>3) Make a hole in one end of the flat piece of wood using a knife, heated
nail or drill.
<BR>4) Tie strong string or wire through the hole.
<BR>5) Place flat piece of wood between the jaws of the clothespin switch.

   <BR><BR>  When the flat piece of wood is removed by pulling the string, the
jaws of the clothespin will close, completing the circuit.

<BR><BR>CAUTION: Do not attach the battery until the switch and trip wire have
been emplaced and examined. Be sure that the flat piece of wood is
seperating the jaws of the switch.
