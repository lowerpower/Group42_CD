<P>A different kind of Molitoff Cocktail               by the Jolly Roger
<br><br>
Here is how you do it:

<br> - Get a coke bottle & fill it with gasoline about half full

<br> - Cram a piece of cloth into the neck of it nice and tight

<br> - Get a chlorine tablet and stuff it in there. You are going to have
to force it because the tablets are bigger than the opening of the
bottle.

<br> - Now find a suitable victim and wing it in their direction. When it
hits the pavement or any surface hard enough to break it, and the chlorine
and gasoline mix..... BOOM!!!!!!
<br>Have fun!                                    -Jolly Roger-
