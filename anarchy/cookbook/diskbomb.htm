<P>Diskette Bombs                                  by the Jolly Roger

<P>You need:<BR>

 - A disk<BR>
 - Scissors<BR>
 - White or blue kitchen matches (they MUST be these colors!)<BR>
 - Clear nail polish<br>
- Carefully open up the diskette (3.5" disks are best for this!)<br>
- Remove the cotton covering from the inside.<br>
- Scrape a lot of match powder into a bowl (use a wooden scraper,
metal might spark the matchpowder!)<BR>
- After you have a lot, spread it evenly on the disk.<BR>
- Using the nail polish, spread it over the match mixture<BR>
- Let it dry<BR>
- Carefully put the diskette back together and use the nail polish
to seal it shut on the inside (where it came apart).<BR>
- When that disk is in a drive, the drive head attempts to read
the disk, which causes a small fire (ENOUGH HEAT TO MELT THE DISK
DRIVE AND FUCK THE HEAD UP!!). ahahahahaha! Let the fuckhead try
and fix THAT!!!<BR>                        -Jolly Roger-
