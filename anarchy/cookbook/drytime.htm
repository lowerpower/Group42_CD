Dried Seed Timer                                    by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     A time delay device for electrical firing circuits can be made using
the principle of expansion of dried seeds.

<BR><BR>Material Required:
<BR>-----------------

<BR>Dried peas, beans, or oter dehydrated seeds
<BR>Wide-mouth glass jar with non-metal cap
<BR>Two screws or bolts
<BR>Thin metal plate
<BR>Hand drill
<BR>Screwdriver

<BR><BR>Procedure:
<BR>---------
<BR>1) Determine the rate of the rise of the dried seeds selected. This is
necessary to determine the delay time of the timer.
<BR>     a) Place a sample of the dried seeds in the jar and cover with
        water.
<BR>     b) Measure the time it takes for the seeds to rise a given height.
        Most dried seeds increase 50% in one to two hours.
<BR>2) Cut a disc from thin metal plate. Disc should fit loosely inside the
jar.

<BR><BR>NOTE: If metal is painted, rusty, or otherwise coated, it must be scraped
or sanded to obtain a clean metal surface
<BR><BR>3) Drill two holes in the cap of the jar about 2 inches apart. Diameter
of holes should be such that screws or bolts will thread tightly into
them. If the jar has a metal cap or no cap, a piece of wood or plastic
(NOT METAL) can be used as a cover.
<BR>4) Turn the two screws or bolts through the holes in the cap. Bolts
should extend about one in. (2 1/2 cm) into the jar.

<BR><BR>IMPORTANT: Both bolts must extend the same distance below the container
cover.

<BR><BR>5) Pour dried seeds into the container. The level will depend upon the
previously measured rise time and the desired delay.
<BR>6) Place the metal disc in the jar on top of the seeds.

<BR><BR>How to use:
<BR>----------

<BR>1) Add just enough water to completely cover the seeds and place the cap
on the jar.
<BR>2) Attach connecting wires from the firing circuit to the two screws on
the cap.
<BR><BR>
Expansion of the seeds will raise the metal disc until it contacts the
screws and closes the circuit.
