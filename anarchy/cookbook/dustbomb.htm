Dust Bomb Instructions                               by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     An initiator which will initiate common material to produce dust
explosions can be rapidly and easily constructed. This type of charge is
ideal for the destruction of enclosed areas such as rooms or buildings.

<BR><BR>Material Required
<BR>-----------------
<BR>A flat can, 3 in. (8 cm) in diameter and 1-1/2 in. (3-3/4 cm) high. A 6-
     1/2 ounce tuna can serves the purpose quite well.
<BR>Blasting cap
<BR>Explosive
<BR>Aluminum (may be wire, cut sheet, flattened can, or powder)
<BR>Large nail, 4 in. (10 cm) long
<BR>Wooden rod - 1/4 in. (6 mm) diameter
<BR>Flour, gasoline, and powder or chipped aluminum

<BR><BR>NOTE: Plastic explosive produce better explosions than cast explosives.

<BR><BR>Procedure:
<BR>---------

<BR>1) Using the nail, press a hole through the side of the tuna can 3/8 inch
to 1/2 inch (1 to 1-1/2 cm) from the bottom. Using a rotating and lever
action, enlarge the hole until it will accomodate the blasting cap.
<BR>2) Place the wooden rod in the hole and position the end of the rod at the
center of the can.
<BR>3) Press explosive into the can, being sure to surround the rod, until it
is 3/4 inch (2 cm) from the top of the can. Carefully remove the wooden
rod.
<BR>4) Place the aluminum metal on top of the explosive.
<BR>5) Just before use, insert the blasting cap into the cavity made by the
rod. The initiator is now ready to use.

<BR><BR>NOTE: If it is desired to carry the initiator some distance, cardboard may
be pressed on top of the aluminum to insure against loss of material.

<BR><BR>How to Use:
<BR>----------

<BR><BR>     This particular unit works quite well to initiate charges of five
pounds of flour, 1/2 gallon (1-2/3 litres) of gasoline, or two pounds of
flake painters aluminum. The solid materials may merely be contained in
sacks or cardboard cartons. The gasoline may be placed in plastic coated
paper milk cartons, as well as plastic or glass bottles. The charges are
placed directly on top of the initiator and the blasting cap is actuated
electrically or by a fuse depending on the type of cap employed. this will
destroy a 2,000 cubic feet enclosure (building 10 x 20 x 10 feet).

<BR><BR>Note: For larger enclosures, use proportionally larger initiators and
charges.
