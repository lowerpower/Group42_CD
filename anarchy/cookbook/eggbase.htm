<BR><BR>Procedure:
<BR>---------

<BR><BR>CAUTION: Make sure that ther are no open flames in the area when mixing
flame fuels! NO SMOKING!!

<BR><BR>1) Seperate the egg white from the yolk. This can be done by breaking the
egg into a dish and carefully removing the yolk with a spoon.
<BR>2) Pour egg white into a jar, bottle, or other container, and add gasoline.
<BR>3) Add the salt (or other additive) to the mixture and stir occasionally
until gel forms (about 5 to 10 minutes).

<BR><BR>NOTE: A thicker gelled flame fuel can be obtained by putting the capped jar
in hot (65 degrees Centegrade) water for about 1/2 hour and then letting
them cool to room temperature. (DO NOT HEAT THE GELLED FUEL CONTAINING
COFFEE!!)
