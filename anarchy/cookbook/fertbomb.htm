<P>How to make a fertilizer bomb                       by Jolly Roger
<P>Ingredients:
<P>- Newspaper
<P>- Fertilizer (the chemical kind, GREEN THUMB or ORCHO)
<P>- Cotton
<P>- Diesel fuel
<P>Make a pouch out of the newspaper and put some fertilizer in it.
Then put cotton on top. Soak the cotton with fuel. Then light and
run like you have never ran before! This blows up 500 square feet
so don't do it in an alley!!               -Jolly Roger-
