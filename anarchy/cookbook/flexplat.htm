Flexible Plate Switch                             by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     This flexible plate switch is used for initiating emplaced mines and
explosives.

<BR><BR>Material Required:
<BR>-----------------

<BR>Two flexible metal sheets
<BR>  one approximately 10 in. (25 cm) square
<BR>  one approximately 10 in. x 8 in. (20 cm)
<BR>Piece of wood 10 in. square x 1 in. thick
<BR>Four soft wood blocks 1 in. x 1 in. x 1/4 in.
<BR>Eight flat head nails, 1 in. long
<BR>Connecting wires
<BR>Adhesive tape

<BR><BR>Procedure:
<BR>---------

<BR>1) Nail 10 in. by 8 in. metal sheet to 10 in. square piece of wood so that
1 in. of wood shows on each side of the metal. Leave one of the nails
sticking up about 1/4 in.
<BR>2) Strip insulation from the end of one connecting wire. Wrap this end
around the nail and drive the nail all the way in.
<BR>3) Place the four wood blocks on the corners of the wood base.
<BR>4) Place the 10 in. square flexible metal sheet so that it rests on the
blocks in line with the wood base.
<BR>5) Drive four nails through the metal sheet and the blocks (1 per block)
to fasten the sheet to the wood base. A second connecting wire is atached
to one of the nails as in step #2.
<BR>6) Wrap the adhesive tape around the edges of the plate and wood base.
This will assure that no dirt or other foreign matter will get between the
plates and prevent the switch from operating.

<BR><BR>How to use:
<BR>----------

<BR><BR>The switch is placed in a hole in the path of expected traffic and covered
with a thin layer of dirt or other camouflaging material. The mine or
other explosive device connected to the switch can be buried with the
switch or emplaced elsewhere as desired.

<BR><BR>When a vehicle passes over the switch, the two metal plates make contact
closing the firing circuit.
