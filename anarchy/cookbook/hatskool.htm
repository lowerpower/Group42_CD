<P>Do ya hate school?                  by The Jolly Roger

<P>- One of my favorites for getting out of a class or two is to call
in a bomb threat. Tell 'em that it is in a locker. Then they have
to check them all, whilst you can slip away for an hour or two.
You can even place a fake bomb (in any locker but YOURS!). They
might cancel school for a week while they investigate (of course,
you will probably have to make it up in the summer...).

<P>- Get some pure potassium or pure sodium, put it in a capsule, and
flush it down the toilet (smells awful! Stinks up the whole school!).

<P>- Use a smoke grenade in the hallway.

<P>- Steal the computer passwords & keys. Or steal the 80 column cards
 inside if they are (gag) IBM.

<P>- Make friends with student assistants and have them change your
grades when the teachers hand in their bubble sheets for the report
cards.

<P>- Spit your gum out on the carpet in the library or whatever and
grind it into the carpet. Watch the janitors cry!

<P>- Draw on lockers or spraypaint on the building that the principal
is a fascist.

<P>- Stick a potato in the tailpipe of the principal's car.

<P>- USE YOUR IMAGINATION!                   -Jolly Roger-
