Jug Bomb                                        by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>Take a glass jug, and put 3 to 4 drops of gasoline into it. Then put
the cap on, and swish the gas around so the inner surface of the jug
is coated.  Then add a few drops of potassium permanganate solution
into it and cap it.  To blow it up, either throw it at something, or
roll it at something.
