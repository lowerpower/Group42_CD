<P>Exploding lightbulbs                            by The Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>Materials needed:

<BR> -lightbulb (100w)
<BR> -socket (duh...)
<BR> -1/4 cup soap chips
<br> -blackpowder! (open some shotgun shells!)
<br> -1/4 cup kerosene orgasoline
<br> -adhesive tape
<br> -lighter or small blowtorch
<br> -glue

<br>Procedure for a simple exploding lightbulb:
<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<br> - Drill a small hole in the top of the bulb near the threads!

<br> - Carefully pour the blackpowder into the hole. Use enough so
that it touches the filament!

<br> - Insert into socket as normal (make sure the light is off or
else YOU will be the victim!!)

<br> - Get the hell out!!

<br><br>Procedure for a Napam Bulb:
<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<br> - Heat kerosene/gasoline in a double boiler

<br> - Melt soap chips, stirring slowly.

<br> - Put somewhere and allow to cool

<br> - Heat the threads of the bulb VERY carefully to melt the glue.
Remove threads, slowly drawing out the filament. Do NOT break the
cheap electrical igniters and/or the filament or this won't work!!

<br> - Pour the liquid into the bulb, and slowly lower the filament
back down into the bulb. Make sure the filament is dipped into the
fluid.
<br>- Re-glue the threads back on. Insert it into a socket frequently
used by the victim and get the hell out!!

<br><br>When the victim flips the switch, he will be in for a BIG surprise!

<br>Have fun!                              -Jolly Roger-
