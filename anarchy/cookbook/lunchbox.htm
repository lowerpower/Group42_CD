The Lunch Box                          Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>Introduction
<BR>===========

<BR><BR>The Lunch Box is a VERY simple transmitter which can be handy for all sorts
of
things. It is quite small and can easily be put in a number of places. I
have
successfully used it for tapping fones, getting inside info, blackmail and
other such things. The possibilities are endless. I will also include the
plans
or an equally small receiver for your newly made toy. Use it for just about
anything. You can also make the transmitter and receiver together in one
box
and use it as a walkie talkie.

<BR><BR>Notes about the schematic
<BR>=========================

<BR>1.  GND means ground
<BR>2.  The GND near the switch and the GND by the 2meg potentiometer should be
    connected.
<BR>3.  Where you see:  )(
<BR>                    ()
<BR>                    )( it is the transistor antenna coil with 15 turns of
<BR>                       regular hook-up wire around it.
<BR>4.  The middle of the loop on the left side (the left of "()") you should
run
    a wire down to the "+" which has nothing attached to it. There is a
.0047
    capacitor on the correct piece of wire.
<BR>5.  For the microphone use a magnetic earphone (1k to 2k).
<BR>6.  Where you see "[!]" is the antenna. Use about 8 feet of wire to
broadcast
    approx 300ft. Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulation says you can't
    broadcast over 300 feet without a license. (Hahaha). Use more wire for
an
    antenna for longer distances. (Attach it to the black wire on the fone
    line for about a 250 foot antenna!)

<BR><BR>Operation of the Lunch Box
<BR>==========================

<BR><BR>This transmitter will send the signals over the AM radio band. You use the
variable capacitor to adjust what freq. you want to use. Find a good unused
freq. down at the lower end of the scale and you're set. Use the 2 meg pot.
to
adjust gain. Just fuck with it until you get what sounds good. The switch
on
the 2meg is for turning the Lunch Box on and off. When everything is
adjusted,
turn on an AM radio adjust it to where you think the signal is. Have a
friend
lay some shit thru the Box and tune in to it. That's all there is to it.
<BR>The
plans for a simple receiver are shown below:

<BR><BR>Closing statement
<BR>=================

<BR>This two devices can be built for under a total of $10.00. Not too bad.
Using
these devices in illegal ways is your option. If you get caught, I accept
NO
responsibility for your actions. This can be a lot of fun if used
correctly.
<BR>Hook it up to the red wire on the phone line and it will send the
conversation over the air waves.

<BR><BR>Enjoy!
