Match Head Bomb                                 by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>Simple safety match heads in a pipe, capped at both ends, make a
devestating bomb. It is set off with a regular fuse.
<BR><BR>A plastic Baggie is put into the pipe before the heads go in to
prevent detonation by contact with the metal.
<BR><BR>Cutting enough match heads to fill the pipe can be tedious work for
one but an evening's fun for the family if you can drag them away from
the TV.
