Mercury Fulminate                                 by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     Mercury Fulminate is used as a primary explosive in the fabrication
of detonators. It is to be used with a booster explosive such as picric
acid or RDX (which are elsewhere in this Cookbook).

<BR><BR>Procedure:
<BR>---------

<BR>1) Dilute 5 teaspoons of nitric acid with 2-1/2 teaspoons of clean water
in a glass container by adding the acid to the water.
<BR>2) Dissolve 1/8 teaspoon of mercury in the diluted nitric acid. This
will yield dark red fumes. NOTE: It may be necessary to add water, on
drop at a time, to the mercury-acid solution in order to start a
reaction.

<BR><BR>CAUTION: Acid will burn skin and destroy clothing. If any is spilled,
wash it away with a large quantity of water. Do NOT inhale fumes!

<BR><BR>3) Warm 10 teaspoons of the alcohol in a container until the alcohol
feels warm to the inside of the wrist.
<BR>4) Pour the metal-acid solution into the warm alcohol. Reaction should
start in less than 5 minutes. Dense white fumes will be given off during
the reaction. As time lapses, the fumes will become less dense. Allow 10
to 15 minutes to complete reaction. Fulminate will settle to the bottom.

<BR><BR>CAUTION: This reaction generates large quantities of toxic, flammable
fumes. The process MUST be conducted outdoors or in a well-ventilated
area, away from sparks or open flames. DO NOT inhale fumes!

<BR><BR>5) Filter the solution through a paper towel into a container. Crystals
may stick to the side of the container. If so, tilt and squirt water
down the sides of the container until all of the material collects on
the filter paper.
<BR>6) Wash the crystals with 6 teaspoons of ethyl alcohol.
<BR>7) Allow these mercury fulminate crystals to air dry.

<BR><BR>CAUTION: Handle dry explosive with great care. Do not scrape or handle
it roughly! Keep away from sparks or open flames. Store in a cool, dry
place.
