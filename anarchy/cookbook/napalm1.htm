<P>How to make Napalm                              by the Jolly Roger

<P>- Pour some gas into an old bowl, or some kind of container.
<P>- Get some styrofoam and put it in the gas, until the gas won't
eat anymore. You should have a sticky syrup.
<P>- Put it on the end of something (don't touch it!!). The unused
stuff lasts a long time!
