Nicotine                                      by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     Nicotine is an abundant poison. Easily found in tobacco
products, in concentrated form a few drops can quickly kill
someone. Here is how to concentrate it:

<BR>     First get a can of chewing tobacco or pipe tobacco. Remove
the contents and soak in water overnight in a jar (about 2/3 cup
of water will do...). In the morning, strain into another jar the
mixture through a porous towel. Then wrap the towel around the
ball of tobacco and squeeze it until all of the liquid is in the
jar. Throw away the tobacco--you will not need it anymore.

<BR><BR>     Now you have two options. I recommend the first. It makes the
nicotine more potent.
<BR>     1) Allow to evaporate until a sticky syrup results in the
jar. This is almost pure nicotine (hell, it is pure enough for
sure!).
<BR>     2) Heat over low flame until water is evaporated and a thick
sticky syrup results (I don't know how long it takes... shouldn't
take too long, though.).

<BR><BR>     Now all you have to do, when you wish to use it, is to put
a few drops in a medicine dropper or equivalent, and slip about 4
or 5 drops into the victim's coffee. Coffee is recommended since it
will disguise the taste. Since nicotine is a drug, the victim
should get quite a buzz before they turn their toes up to the
daisies, so to speak.

<BR><BR>     Note: If the syrup is too sticky, dilute it with a few drops
of water. And while you are at it, better add an extra drop to the
coffee just to be sure!
