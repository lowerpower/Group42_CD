Nitric Acid                                     by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     Nitric Acid is used in the preparation of many explosives, incediary
mixtures, and acid delay timers. It may be prepared by distilling a mixture
of potassium nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid.

<BR><PRE>Material Required                                 Sources
-----------------                                 -------
Potassium Nitrate (2 parts by volume)             Elsewhere in this
                                                  Cookbook, or drug store
CONCENTRATED sulfuric acid (1 part by volume)     Motor vehicle batteries
                                                  Industrial plants
2 bottles or ceramin jugs (narrow necks are
     preferable)
Pot or frying pan
Heat source (wood, charcoal, or coal)
Tape (paper, electrical, masking, but NOT cellophane!)
Paper or rags</PRE>

<BR><BR>IMPORTANT: If sulfuric acid is obtained from a motor vehicle battery,
concentrate it by boiling it UNTIL white fumes appear. DO NOT INHALE FUMES

<BR><BR>NOTE: The amount of nitric acid produced is th same as the amount of
potassium nitrate. Thus, for two tablespoons of nitric acid, use 2
tablespoons of potassium nitrate and 1 tablespoonful of concentrated
sulfuric
acid.

<BR><BR>Procedure:
<BR>---------

<BR>1) Place dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug. Add sulfuric acid. Do not
fill the bottle more than 1/4 full. Mix until paste is formed.

<BR><BR>CAUTION: DO NOT INHALE FUMES!

<BR><BR>2) Wrap paper or rags around necks of two bottles. securly tape necks of
two
bottles together. Be sure that bottles are flush against each other and
that
there are no air spaces.
<BR>3) Support bottles on rocks or cans so that empty bottle is SLIGHTLY lower
than bottle containing paste so that nitric acid that is formed in
receiving
bottle will not run into other bottle.
<BR>4) Build fire in pot or frying pan.
<BR>5) Gently heat bottle containing mixture by gently moving fire in and out.
As
red fumes begin to appear periodically pour cool water over empty receiving
bottle. Nitric acid will befin to form in receiving bottle.

<BR><BR>CAUTION: Do not overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may
shatter.
As an added precaution, place bottle to be heated in heat resistant
container
filled with sand or gravel. Heat this outer container to produce nitric
acid.

<BR><BR>6) Continue the above process until no more red fumes are formed. If the
nitric acid formed in the receiving bottle is not clear (cloudy) pour it
into
cleaned bottle and repeat steps 2-6.

<BR><BR>CAUTION: Nitric acid should be ket away from all combustables and should be
kept in a SEALED CERAMIC OR GLASS container. DO NOT inhale fumes!
