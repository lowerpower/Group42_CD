<BR><BR>    This is a relatively new box, and all it basically does is serve as a
phone
ringer. You have two choices for ringers, a piezoelectric transducer
(ringer),
or a standard 8 ohm speaker. The speaker has a more pleasant tone to it,
but
either will do fine. This circuit can also be used in conjunction with a
rust
box to control an external something or other when the phone rings. Just
connect
the 8 ohm speaker output to the inputs on the rust box, and control the pot
to
tune it to light the light (which can be replaced by a relay for external
controlling) when the phone rings.

<BR><BR>Shift Rate:
<BR>-----------

<BR><BR>  This is the formula for determining the shift rate:

<PRE>                   1                   1
    SR = --------------------- = ------------ = 6.25 Hz
         (DSR(1/f1)+DSR(1/f2))    128     128
                                 ----  + ----
                                 1714    1500


              DSR = Shift Devider Rate ratio = 128
                f1 = High Output Frequency = 1714
               f2 = Low Output Frequency = 1500</PRE>
