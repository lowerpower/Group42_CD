Phone Dial Locks -- How to Beat'em      courtesy of the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>    Have you ever been in an office or somewhere and wanted to make a free
phone
call but some asshole put a lock on the phone to prevent out-going calls?
Fret
no more phellow phreake, for every system can be beaten with a little
knowledge!

<BR><BR>    There are two ways to beat this obstacle, first pick the lock, I don't
have
the time to teach locksmithing so we go to the second method which takes
advantage of telephone electronics.

<BR><BR>    To be as simple as possibnle when you pick up the phone you complete a
circuit known as a local loop. When you hang up you break the circuit.
When
you dial (pulse) it also breaks the circuit but not long enough to hang up!
So
you can "Push-dial."  To do this you >>> RAPIDLY <<< depress the
switchhook.
For example, to dial an operator (and then give her the number you want to
call)
>>> RAPIDLY <<< & >>> EVENLY <<< depress the switchhook 10 times.  To dial
634-1268, depress 6 X'S pause, then 3 X'S, pause, then 4X'S, etc.  It takes
a
little practice but you'll get the hang of it.  Try  practicing with your
own #
so you'll get a busy tone when right.  It'll also work on touch-tone(tm)
since
a DTMF line will also accept pulse.  Also, never depress the switchhook for
more than a second or it'll hang up!

<BR><BR>    Finally, remember that you have just as much right to that phone as the
asshole who put the lock on it!
