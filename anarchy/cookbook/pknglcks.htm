<P>Picking Master Locks                            by The Jolly Roger
<P>Have you ever tried to impress someone by picking one of those
Master combination locks and failed?

<P>The Master lock company made their older combination locks with a
protection scheme.  If you pull the handle too hard, the knob will
not turn.  That was their biggest mistake.
<P>The first number:

<P>Get out any of the Master locks so you know what is going on.
While pulling on the clasp (part that springs open when you get
the combination right), turn the knob to the left until it will
not move any more, and add five to the number you reach.  You now
have the first number of the combination.

<P>The second number:

<P>Spin the dial around a couple of times, then go to the first
number you got.  Turn the dial to the right, bypassing the first
number once.  When you have bypassed the first number, start
pulling on the clasp and turning the knob.  The knob will
eventually fall into the groove and lock.  While in the groove,
pull the clasp and turn the knob.  If the knob is loose, go to the
next groove, if the knob is stiff, you have the second number of
the combination.

<P>The third number:

<P>After getting the second number, spin the dial, then enter the two
numbers.  Slowly spin the dial to the right, and at each number,
pull on the clasp.  The lock will eventually open if you did the
process right.

<P>This method of opening Master locks only works on older models.
Someone informed Master of their mistake, and they employed a new
mechanism that is foolproof (for now).
