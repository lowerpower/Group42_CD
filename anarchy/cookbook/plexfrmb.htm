<P>Making Plastic Explosives from Bleach           by The Jolly Roger

<P>Potassium chlorate is an extremely volatile explosive compound,
and has been used in the past as the main explosive filler in
grenades, land mines, and mortar rounds by such countries as
France and Germany.  Common household bleach contains a small
amount of potassium chlorate, which can be extracted by the
procedure that follows.

<P>First off, you must obtain:

<P>[1]  A heat source (hot plate, stove, etc.)
<P>[2]  A hydrometer, or battery hydrometer
<P>[3]  A large Pyrex, or enameled steel container (to weigh
     chemicals)
<P>[4]  Potassium chloride (sold as a salt substitute at health and
     nutrition stores)

<P>Take one gallon of bleach, place it in the container, and begin
heating it.  While this solution heats, weigh out 63 grams of
potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated.
Constantly check the solution being heated with the hydrometer,
and boil until you get a reading of 1.3.  If using a battery
hydrometer, boil until you read a FULL charge.

<P>Take the solution and allow it to cool in a refrigerator until it
is between room temperature and 0 degrees Celcius.  Filter out the
crystals that have formed and save them.  Boil this solution again
and cool as before.  Filter and save the crystals.

<P>Take the crystals that have been saved, and mix them with
distilled water in the following proportions:  56 grams per 100
milliliters distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils
and allow to cool.  Filter the solution and save the crystals that
form upon cooling.  This process of purification is called
"fractional crystalization".  These crystals should be relatively
pure potassium chlorate.

<P>Powder these to the consistency of face powder, and heat gently to
drive off all moisture.

<P>Now, melt five parts Vaseline with five parts wax.  Dissolve this
in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline), and pour this liquid on
90 parts potassium chlorate (the powdered crystals from above)
into a plastic bowl.  Knead this liquid into the potassium
chlorate until intimately mixed.  Allow all gasoline to evaporate.

<P>Finally, place this explosive into a cool, dry place.  Avoid
friction, sulfur, sulfides, and phosphorous compounds.  This
explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density of 1.3
grams in a cube and dipped in wax until water proof.  These block
type charges guarantee the highest detonation velocity.  Also, a
blasting cap of at least a 3 grade must be used.

<P>The presence of the afore mentioned compounds (sulfur, sulfides,
etc.) results in mixtures that are or can become highly sensitive
and will possibly decompose explosively while in storage.  You
should never store homemade explosives, and you must use EXTREME
caution at all times while performing the processes in this
article.
