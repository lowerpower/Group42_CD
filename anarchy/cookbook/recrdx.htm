Reclamation of RDX from C-4 Explosives            by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     RDX can be obtained from C-4 explosives with the use of gasoline. It
can
be used as a booster explosive for detonators or as a high explosive
charge.

<BR><BR>Material Required
<BR>-----------------
<PRE>Gasoline
C-4 explosive
2 - pint glass jars, wide mouth
Paper towels
Stirring rod (glass or wood)
Water
Ceramic or glass dish
Pan
Heat source
Teaspoon
Cup
Tape</PRE>

<BR><BR>NOTE: Water, Ceramic or glass dish, pan, & heat source are all optional.
The
RDX can be air dried instead.

<BR><BR>Procedure:
<BR>---------

<BR>1) Place 1-1/2 teaspoons (15 grams) of C-4 explosive in one of the pint
jars.
Add 1 cup (240 milliliters) of gasoline.

<BR><BR>NOTE: These quantities can be increased to obtain more RDX. For example,
use 2
gallons of gasoline per 1 cup of C-4.

<BR><BR>2) Knead and stir the C-4 with the rod until the C-4 has broken down into
small
particles. Allow mixture to stand for 1/2 hour.
<BR>3) Stir the mixture again until a fine white powder remains on the bottom
of
the jar.
<BR>4) Filter the mixture through a paper towel into the other glass jar. Wash
the
particles collected on the paper towel with 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of
gasoline. Discard the waste liquid.
<BR>5) Place the RDX particles in a glass or ceramic dish. Set the dish in a
pan of
hot water, not boiling and dry for a period of 1 hour.

<BR><BR>NOTE: The RDX particles may be air dried for a period of 2 to 3 hours.
