Recognizing credit cards                        by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR><PRE>  [Sample: American Express]
      XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX
      MM/Y1 THRU MM/Y2       Y1
      John Doe               AX</PRE>

<BR><BR>Explanation:
<BR>The first date is the date the person got the card, the second
date is the expriation date, after the expiration date is the same
digits in the first year.The American Express Gold has many more
numbers (I think 6 8 then 8). If you do find a Gold card keep it
for it has a $5000.00 backup even when the guy has no money!

<BR><PRE>[Sample: Master Card]
   5XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
   XXXX AAA DD-MM-YY MM/YY
   John Doe.</PRE>

<BR><BR>Explanation:
<BR>The format varies, I have never seen a card that did not start with
a 5XXX there is another 4 digits on the next line that is sometimes
asked for when ordering stuff, (and rarely a 3 digit letter combo
(e. ANB). The first date is the date the person got the card
and the second date is the expiration date.
<BR>Master Card is almost always accepted at stores.
<BR><PRE>[Sample: VISA]
   XXXX XXX(X) XXX(X) XXX(X)
   MM/YY    MM/YY*VISA
   John Doe</PRE>

<BR><BR>Explanation:
<BR>Visa is the most straight forward
of the cards,for it has the name right on the card itself, again the
first date is the date he got the card and the second is the
expiration date. (Sometimes the first date is left out). The
numbers can eather be 4 3 3 3 or 4 4 4 4. Visa is also almost always
accepted at stores, therefore, the best of cards to use.
