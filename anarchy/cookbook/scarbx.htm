Scarlet Box Plans                               by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>   The purpose of a Scarlet box is to create a very bad conection,
it can be used to crash a BBS or just make life miserable for those you
seek to avenge.
<BR><BR>Materials: 2 alligator clips, 3 inch wire, or a resister
<BR>(plain wire will create greatest amount of static)
<BR>(Resister will decrease the amount of static in porportion to
the resister you are using)

<BR><BR>Step (1): Find the phone box at your victims house, and pop the cover off.
<BR><BR>Step (2): Find the two prongs that the phone line you wish to box are
connected to.
<BR><BR>Step (3): Hook your alligator clips to your (wire/resister).
<BR><BR>Step (4): Find the lower middle prong and take off all wires connected to
it, i think this disables the ground and call waiting and shit like that.
<BR><BR>Step (5): Now take one of the alligator clips and attach it to the upper
most prong, and take the other and attach it to the lower middle prong.
<BR><BR>Step (6): Now put the cover back on the box and take off!!
