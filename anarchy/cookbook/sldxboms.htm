<P>Solidox Bombs                                   by The Jolly Roger

<P>Most people are not aware that a volatile, extremely explosive
chemical can be bought over the counter:  Solidox.

<P>Solidox comes in an aluminum can containing 6 grey sticks, and can
be bought at Kmart, and various hardware supply shops for around
$7.00.  Solidox is used in welding applications as an oxidizing
agent for the hot flame needed to melt metal.  The most active
ingredient in Solidox is potassium chlorate, a filler used in many
military applications in the WWII era.

<P>Since Solidox is literally what the name says:  SOLID OXygen, you
must have an energy source for an explosion.  The most common and
readily available energy source is common household sugar, or
sucrose.  In theory, glucose would be the purest energy source,
but it is hard to find a solid supply of glucose.

<P>Making the mixture:

<P>[1]  Open the can of Solidox, and remove all 6 sticks.  One by one, grind up each of the sticks (preferably with a mortar and pestle) into the finest powder possible.
<P>[2]  The ratio for mixing the sugar with the Solidox is 1:1, so weigh the Solidox powder, and grind up the equivalent amount of sugar.
<P>[3]  Mix equivalent amounts of Solidox powder, and sugar in a 1:1 ratio.

<P>It is just that simple!  You now have an extremely powerful
substance that can be used in a variety of applications.  A word
of caution:  be EXTREMELY careful in the entire process.  Avoid
friction, heat, and flame.  A few years back, a teenager I knew
blew 4 fingers off while trying to make a pipe bomb with Solidox.
You have been warned!
