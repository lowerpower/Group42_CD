<P>Smoke Bombs                         by the Jolly Roger

<P>Here is the recipe for one helluva smoke bomb!

<P>4 parts sugar
<P>6 parts potassium nitrate (Salt Peter)

<P>Heat this mixture over a LOW flame until it melts, stirring well.
Pour it into a future container and, before it solidifies, imbed a
few matches into the mixture to use as fuses. One pound of this
stuff will fill up a whole block with thick, white smoke!
