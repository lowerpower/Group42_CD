Sodium Chlorate                                by the Jolly Roger

<BR><BR>     Sodium Chlorate is a strong oxidizer used in the manufacture of
explosives. It can be used in place of Potassium Chlorate.

2 carbon or lead rods (1 in. diameter        Dry Cell Batteries
by 5 in. long)                               (2-1/2 in. diameter by
                                             7" long) or plumbing

Motor Vehicle
Water
2 wires, 16 gauge (3/64 in. diameter approx.), 6 ft. long, insulated.
Gasoline
1 gallon glass jar, wide mouth (5 in. diameter by 6 in. high approx.)
Sticks
String
Teaspoon
Trays
Cup
Heavy cloth
Knife
Large flat pan or tray</PRE>

<BR><BR>Procedure
<BR>---------

<BR>1) Mix 1/2 cup of salt into the one gallon glass jar with 3 litres (3
quarts) of water.
<BR>2) Add 2 teaspoons of battery acid to the solution and stir vigorously
for 5 minutes.
<BR>3) Strip about 4 inches of insulation from both ends of the two wires.
<BR>4) With knife and sticks, shape 2 strips of wood 1 by 1/8 by 1-1/2. Tie
the wood strips to the lead or carbon rods so that they are 1-1/2 incles
apart.
<BR>5) Connect the rods to the battery in a motor vehicle with the insulated
wire.
<BR>6) Submerge 4-1/2 inches of the rods in the salt water solution.
<BR>7) With gear in neutral position, start the vehicle engine. Depress the
accelerator approx. 1/5 of its full travel.
<BR>8) Run the engine with the accelerator in this position for 2 hours, then
shut it down for 2 hours.
<BR>9) Repeat this cycle for a total of 64 hours while maintaining the level
of the acid-salt water solution in the glass jar.

<BR><BR>CAUTION: This arrangement employs voltages which can be quite dangerous!
Do not touch bare wire leads while engine is running!!

<BR>10) Shut off the engine. Remove the rods from the glass jar and
disconnect wire leads from the battery.
<BR>11) Filter the solution through the heavy cloth into a flat pan or tray,
leaving the sediment at the bottom of the glass jar.
<BR>12) Allow the water in the filtered solution to evaporate at room
temperature (approx. 16 hours). The residue is approximately 60% or more
sodium chlorate which is pure enough to be used as an explosive
ingredient.
