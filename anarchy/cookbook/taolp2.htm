<P>The Arts of Lockpicking II             courtesy of The Jolly Roger

<P>So you want to be a criminal.  Well, if you want to be like James
Bond and open a lock in fifteen seconds, then go to Hollywood,
because that is the only place you are ever going to do it.  Even
experienced locksmiths can spend five to ten minutes on a lock if
they are unlucky.  If you are wanting extremely quick access, look
elsewhere.  The following instructions will pertain mostly to the
"lock in knob" type lock, since it is the easiest to pick.

<P>First of all, you need a pick set.  If you know a locksmith, get
him to make you a set.  This will be the best possible set for you
to use.  If you find a locksmith unwilling to supply a set, don't
give up hope.  It is possible to make your own, if you have access
to a grinder (you can use a file, but it takes forever).

<P>The thing you need is an allen wrench set (very small).  These
should be small enough to fit into the keyhole slot.  Now, bend
the long end of the allen wrench at a slight angle (not 90
degrees).  Now, take your pick to a grinder or a file, and smooth
the end until it is rounded so it won't hang inside the lock.
Test your tool out on doorknobs at your house to see if it will
slide in and out smoothly.  Now, this is where the screwdriver
comes in.  It must be small enough for it and your pick to be used
in the same lock at the same time, one above the other.  In the
coming instructions, please refer to this chart of the interior of
a lock:
<TT><P>[Please Download the cookbook and look at this, it looks like garbage in HTML. =(</TT>

<P>The object is to press the pin up so that the space between the
upper pin and the lower pin is level with the cylinder wall.  Now,
if you push a pin up, it's tendency is to fall back down, right?
That is where the screwdriver comes in.  Insert the screwdriver
into the slot and turn.  This tension will keep the "solved" pins
from falling back down.  Now, work from the back of the lock to
the front, and when you are through, there will be a click, the
screwdriver will turn freely, and the door will open.

 
<P>Do not get discouraged on your first try!  It will probably take
you about twenty to thirty minutes your first time.  After that,
you will quickly improve with practice.
