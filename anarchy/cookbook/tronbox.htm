<PRE> (C)=CAPACITOR
  F =FUSE
  R =RESISTOR
 I,- ARE WIRE</PRE>
<BR>  PARTS LIST:
<BR> (3) ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS RATED AT 50V(LOWEST) .47UF
<BR> (1) 20-30OHM 1/2 WATT RESISTOR
<BR> (1) 120VOLT FUSE (AMP RATING BEST TO USE AT LEAST HALF OF TOTAL
     HOUSE CURRENT OR EVEN LESS IT KEEPS YOU FROM BLOWING YOUR
     BREAKER JUST IN CASE...)
<BR> (1) POWER CORD (CUT UP AN EXTENSTION CORD. NEED PLUG PART AND WIRE)
<BR> (1) ELECTRICALLY INSULATED BOX


<BR><BR>REST OF SIF YOUR DONT FILL COMFORTABLE ABOUT ELECTRICITY THEN DONT
PLAY WITH THIS THERE IS VOLTAGE PRESENT THAT WILL
***KILL*** YOU......................

<BR><BR>THE THING WORKS WHEN THE LOAD IN YOUR HOUSE IS LOW LIKE AT NIGHT TIME. IT
WILL PUT A REVERSE PHASE SIGNAL ON THE LINE AND CANCEL OUT THE OTHER PHASE
AND PUT A REVERSE PHASE RUNNING EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE. WELL IF YOU HAVE
EVER SWITCHED THE POWER LEADS ON A D.C. (BATTERY POWERED) MOTOR YOU
WILL SEE THAT IT RUNS BACKWARDS WELL YOUR ELECTRIC METER SORT OF WORKS
THIS WAY...SO REVERSE PHASE MAKES THE METER SLOW DOWN AND IF YOUR
LUCKY IT WILL GO BACKWARDS. ANYWAY IT MEANS A CHEAPER ELECTRIC BILL.
