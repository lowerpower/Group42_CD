<P>Under water igniters                            by The Jolly Roger

<br><br>Materials needed:

<br> -Pack of 10 silicon diodes (available at Radio Shack. you will
  know you got the right ones if they are very, very small glass
  objects!)
<br> -Pack of matches
<br> -1 candle

<br><br>Procedure:

<br> - Light the candle and allow a pool of molten wax to form in the
top.

<br> - Take a single match and hold the glass part of a single diode
against the head. Bend the diode pins around the matchhead so that
one wraps in an upward direction and thensticks out to the side.
Do the same with the other wire, but in a downward direction. The
diodes should now be hugging the matchhead, but its wires MUST NOT
TOUCH EACH OTHER!

<br> - Dip the matchhead in wax to give it a water-proof coat. These
work underwater

<br> - repeat to make as many as you want

<br><br>How to use them:

<br>When these little dudes are hooked across a 6v battery, the diode
reaches what is called breakdown voltage. When most electrical
components reach this voltage, they usually produce great amounts
of heat and light, while quickly melting into a little blob. This
heat is enough to ignite a matchhead. These are recommended for
use underwater, where most other igniters refuse to work. ENJOY!
