<P>Ways to send a car to Hell            by The Jolly Roger

<P>There are 1001 ways to destroy a car but I am going to cover only
the ones that are the most fun (for you), the most destructive
(for them), and the hardest to trace (for the cops).

<P>- Place thermite on the hood, light it, and watch it burn all the
way through the pavement!

<P>- Tape a CO2 bomb to the hood, axel, gas tank, wheel, muffler,
etc.)

<P>- Put a tampon, dirt, sugar (this one is good!), a ping pong ball,
or just about anything that will dissolve in the gas tank.

<P>- Put potatoes, rocks, banannas, or anything that will fit, into
the tailpipe. Use a broom handle to stuff 'em up into the
tailpipe.

<P>- Put a long rag into the gas tank and light it...

<P>- Steal a key, copy it, replace it, and then steal the stereo.

<P>- Break into the car. Cut a thin metal ruler into a shape like
this:
<P>             ----
<P>             |  |
<P>             |  |
<P>             |  |
<P>             | <
<P>             ----

<P>Slide it into the outside window and keep pulling it back up until
you catch the lock cable which should unlock the door. This device
is also called a SLIM JIM. Now get the stereo, equalizer, radar
detector, etc. Now destroy the inside. (A sharp knife does wonders
on the seats!)

<P>Have Fun!                                    -Jolly Roger-
