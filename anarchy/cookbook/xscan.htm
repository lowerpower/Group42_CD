Exchange Scanning                       courtesy of the Jolly Roger


<BR><BR>    Almost every exchange in the bell system has test #'s and other
"goodies"
such as loops with dial-ups. These "goodies" are usually found betweed 9900
and 9999 in your local exchange.  If you have the time and initiative, scan
your exchange and you may become lucky!

<BR><BR>Here are some findings in the 914-268 exchange:


<PRE>9900 - ANI
9901 - ANI
9927 - OSC. TONE (POSSIBLE TONE SIDE OF A LOOP)
9936 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL OFFICE
9937 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL OFFICE
9941 - COMPUTER (DIGITAL VOICE TRANSMISSION?)
9960 - OSC. TONE (TONE SIDE LOOP) MAY ALSO BE A COMPUTER IN SOME EXCHANGES
9961 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9962 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9963 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9966 - COMPUTER (SEE 9941)
9968 - TONE THAT DISAPPEARS--RESPONDS TO CERTAIN TOUCH-TONE KEYS</PRE>

<BR><BR>    Most of the numbers between 9900 & 9999 will ring or go to a "what #,
please?" operator.
