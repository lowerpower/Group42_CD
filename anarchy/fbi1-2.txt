                          ASSASINATION MADE EASY
  By:GaRBlED UsEr

     PART I:  The Beginning
   Ok.. So theres this guy who stole yer girlfreind, or beat up yer little
sister, or something to that effect. What goes through you mind first?
-Not WHY, not WHEN, not IF...
But rather HOW should I kill him?

   Well, you could beat him up...naw...unoriginal. Plus you MIGHT get hurt!
You could get yer 5 best friends, and beat him up.  Nope, makes ya look wimpy.

   Well.. only one option left.. Assasinate him!

   How you say.. Well.. In the next few parts.. I'll tell you..
But Before I do.. READ THESE!!
=========================
:THE ELEVEN COMMANDMENTS:
: OF REVENGE from SCREW :
:   UNTO OTHERS by      :
:    George Hayduke     :
=========================

1) Thou shalt neither trust nor confide in anyone!
2) Thou shalt never use thine own telephone for revenge business!
3) Thou shalt not touch thine form of revenge!
4) Thou shalt become a garbage collector!
5) Thou shalt bide thy time before activating a revenge plot!
6) Thou shalt secure a "mail-drop" address in another city!
7) Thou shalt learn everything there is to learn about the vicitm!
8) Thou shalt pay cash all the time in a revenge plot!
9) Thou shalt trade with merchants who have never heard of you!
0) Thou shalt never threaten thy intended victim!
!) Thou shalt not leave evidence lying around, however circumstantial.


     PART II:  The Hunt
   Well, you know his name...that's a start.  Now, as around about him. BE 
DISCREET!! Only ask CLOSE freinds.. or just kinda slip it into a conversation.. 
and sit back while people tell you all about him (especially his enemies!)

   Grab yerself a phone book.. Hopefully, you have a ROUGH idea where he 
lives..  Look him up.. and try to narrow it down. Ex- Yer huntin down a kid 
named Ralph Norwieg.. Well.. look up Norwieg.. WHAT?!! 30 entries.. Hmm..  he 
lives SOMEWHERE in liverpool.. that leaves 10.. Now call em all, and ask for 
Ralph, you should end up with one or 2..  with luck.. you can figure out which 
is him just by his voice.. Or a "POLL". "Excuse me, how many high school 
students live here?, and thier names?" (that one ALLWAYS works..)

   Now you know his Phone # and address... Now.. start planning...
Step I: The LIE.
   Be REAL nice to him.. make freinds with him, tell him everything is
   forgiven.. Have one of your freinds threaten him, when they do.. jump in
   to "save the day". This will earn you his trust.

Step II: The PLAN!
   Now.. First you need to decide an assasination method.. Hmm.. you could:
        -Poison his food
        -Blow his house up
        -Blow his car up
              O R
  Kill him(NOT advised.. VERY dangerous!!!)

   Ok.. Lets say you decide to poison his food.. Now, grab a vial of yer 
FAVORITE biotoxin, and eat lunch with him someday. Take him up to McDonalds..  
Ask him "Tell me what you want, My treat.. just go find a table" You order his 
shit, and when NOBODY is looking, dump the little vial (MAKE SURE it is a 
POWERFUL poison.. so that it does NOT take much to KILL!!!) onto his food.  
Now.. This is VERY important.. Eat with him.. make sure HE gets the poisoned 
food(duh!) Don't act all jittery, or scared.. just act natural. Start a 
conversation even..  Sooner or later, the poison gets to him.. Now this is VERY 
IMPO!!!!  Say ,no, YELL "OH MY GOD!! Ralph? Ralph?" (start shaking his sholder) 
"QUICK!  Somebody call an ambulance!!, RALPH..  SPEAK TO ME!!,, Oh my god.. He 
didn't deserve to die" Make sure you show up at the funeral.. Cry alot.. bring 
lotsa flowers.. The cops will NEVER suspect you.. AND DONT brag about it!! Ya 
gotta act like yer best freind just died.. You even show the SLIGHTEST sign of 
hatered towards him.. yer toast.  Even better, Use botulism.. WHy? IF it's a
relative of yours, you can sue McDonalds while yer at it!!

   Don't like the poisoning idea eh? Well.. what was next on that list? OH 
Yeah.. Blow his house up.
   First off.. Timing is EVERYTHING.. You blow up his house while he's at 
school.. and, well.. that's just stupid. Actually.. The best thing to do is, 
call him up on the night of the bomb.. Ask him if he's doing anything that 
night. Talk to him.. blah blah blah. Keep the putz on the fone till he goes to 
bed. Then.. begin your plan.
   Point A. The more people who know what yer doing.. the bigger chance of a 
wimpout.. or a rat. Keep it to a FEW trusted freinds. 3 is a MAXIMUM!
   Point B.  Hit about 2am. Give yourself enough time to be a couple miles away 
when it goes off.. an alabi helps.
  That should do it. Basically, Plant the bomb in a way you KNOW it will hit 
him. If his room is in the back of the house.. don't plant the bomb on the 
porch! Plant the devise AS NEAR TO HIM AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN!!! Even if it's enof 
explosives to blow up a city block. The only stupid assasin, is the one who is 
overconfident. Make sure you use a timer, you want an hour or two to get the 
hell away. Unless you intend to use a lightbulb, or sodacan.. or similar device.
Follow these steps..and the basic rules of non-stupidity(threats are DEFINATELY 
OUT!) and you will have done a good deed for society.. the destruction of 
another dork.

  SO... the putz has a car eh? WELL.. this one is SIMPLE! Simply get yourself a 
nice fused explosive.. put it NEAR the passenger area of the car.. tie the fuse 
around the exaust manifold. And.. when your unsuspecting target drives to 
school.. he will hit the sky halfway down the highway.

Ain't Death Grand???!

 Yes.. from the WONDERFUL idea of the gerbil feed bomb comes......

                         The Peanut Butter Bomb.

     I was inspired by Acid Reign to write this file.. Bravo Acid..!
 Possibly you've heard of the almighty gerbil feed bomb. Well.. this is a 
variation of that WONDERFUL anti-personnel device.
WHAT YOU NEED:
      -1- Jiff Peanut butter Jar.(NOT PLASTIC!)
      - - Gasoline
      - - Some gunpowder.(empty a few shotgun shells)
      -1- Model airplane glue.
      - - Sugar.
      -1- Fuse.(any type except electric)
      -1- Psychotic tendency.

Ok.. Mix the gunpowder with the sugar in a 10:1 ratio. Then add enough model 
glue to thoroughly coat the mixture. Mix the glue and the mixture so that the 
newly formed mixture becomes VERY sticky. Half fill the peanut butter jar with 
this. Now, add the gasoline. Fill the jar the rest of the way up. Close the jar. 
Shake vigorously(not TOO vigorously!). Now drill a hole in the lid. Put the fuse 
in the jar. Light the fuse. And unless you are quite a far way away from this 
little toy when it explodes.. prepare to die. The only drawback to this bomb 
is.. if you add the gasoline a while before you set the bomb off, it may jam up. 
Of course.. you can overcome this by pouring the gasoline in JUST before you 
plant the bomb. This bomb will have about 2 - 10 times the power of the gerbil 
feed bomb.
HAVE A BLAST! (literally)

    How to make a SAFEer Carbide Bomb!

       by Sentinel

 Ever make a carbide bomb and have it go off in yer face? Yes, No?. well, here's
a REALLY simple way to do such that is so mind bogglingly obvious i'm suprised
I didn't read it elsewhere (yep, an FBI first!)

   First: i'll tell you how to make a regular Carbide bomb, and also explain why
they suck. First off, go somewhere and TRY to get some Calcium Carbide. Now
this is sometimes called "Lantern Fuel" They always say that you can get it in
any hardware store... WRONG you'll end up looking like an asshole "Duuh, got
any <fillinablank>" Sometimes you can get it in "Hickville" hardware stores...
(if the guy behind the counter is wearing Flannel, has a sunburnt neck, and has
a beard, chances are, yer in hickville) another possible location is
"Spieleology" shops (people who climb in caves) ask fer lantern fuel, you can
usually buy it in "Economy Size" (ie: enough to blow the hell outta city block)
The only place I seem to have found it is in the closet marked "Danger
chemicals, Do NOT enter" in the science labs. it will look like gravel with
brownish powder. and will smell like pig shit. Take a bottle, put a bit of
water in it (about a third to half of the bottle) then place a handful of
calcium carbide in the bottle (1 handful per 1/2 litre or an average "Soda
bottle") Unfortunately as soon as the Calcium Carbide (i'll call it CC from now
on cause i hate to type as much as you hate to read) AS soon as the CC hits the
water it starts reacting, forming a gas not unlike acetylene (the stuff in
cutting torches) now, this stuff spatters all over yer hands, clothes, the
floor, and if you cap it (if you can manage) it blows up almost
instantaneously. Ruining yer complexion.


 Yes now you can have the really improved Sentinel Version! <applause>  take the
bottle, and get yer normal run of the mill balloon, ie: the things you fill
with water and throw out windows of cars. Take the water balloon and stick it
on the end of a faucet just like you would for a water balloon, now slide the
bottle opening over the balloon. THEN fill it with water. once there is
sufficient water (ie: 1/3 to 1/2 of the bottle size) tie the water balloon
(which SHOULD be inside the bottle) now take the CC bomb to wherever you want
it, and throw the CC in, then cap it. if you notice the thing does NOT spurt
out, because the water is in the balloon.  Now, shake the bomb until the
balloon breaks, then set it down (you have approximately 30 seconds before you
hear a BOOM!  and shattered glass goes flying about 20 feet.) what's really
fun, is arm it (fill the balloon, add CC and cap but do NOT shake it) then tape
it to the bottom of a gas tank on a car, or any other vehicle, or just toss it
in the back of a truck.  Eventually the balloon will rupture from either the
knocking around it gets or the reaction of the CC and the small amount of water
that always seems to get in the jar.  For added excitement, leave a burning rag
nearby or pour napalm on the bottle and light it (napalm = gasoline + lots of
styrofoam peanuts) you'll get a HUGE fireball.


    REMEMBER: FBI takes no responsibility for anything you do
anytime, EVER. So be careful. And if yer gonna put it on
someones doorstep and ring the bell... Make sure its someone
you REALLY hate, cause at close range, this will REALLY fuck
someone up.

                     ~~~Rocket Tubes and YOU!~~~
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     This file will tech you the basics of building, loading and using the 
dreaded rocket tube. This is one of the militant's most powerful devices!!

  The rocket tube is a simple device that will let you destoy things at extreme 
distances with relative ease!  This desturctive mechanism allows the roving 
anarchist to take buildings, low flying aircraft, doors, and even people out 
from afar.  Interested yet?? Well  read on..

  The rocket tube can be easily manufactured by taking a few trips around 
town....  A working knowledge in Model Rocketry will help you VERY MUCH!  The 
better you are at rocket building, the more accuracy and power your tube will 
have!
       You will need:

Now here's a nice diagram..

  --->|                                                          |
      |                                                          |
      |                                                          |

              \       \
               \_______\

The back end should be TOTALLY sealed.. unless you want your face ripped apart.
a blast shield around the front end made of sheet metal would also be a good 
idea! But is not nessecary if you put the handle farther back.
NOTE- the farther back the handle is.. the harder it will be to keep the rocket 
straight.. and your accuracy will suffer considerably.

Now.. the rocket is simple to construct... just build a basic rocket..
Now, cut the fins in a manner as shown...

                     \             \
                      \_____________\

The total width of the rocket(with 4 fins!) should be equal to the diameter of 
the rocket tube.. sand them off so they fit nicely.
  Now put the little straw on the side of the rocket.
find yourself a long piece of metal, round and thin.It must be able to fit into
the little straw on the side of the rocket, and should be 3 inches longer than
the rocket tube.
Put the metal piece through the straw, and fit the rocket into the tube.. You
need to secure the metal dowel in a place in the sealed end of the tube. this
will serve as a guide for the rocket. It may be easier if the seal on the back
is removable, or at least seal it on AFTER you put the dowel in.
The entire tube, dowel and all should be greased smooth, all throughout the
inside. This will insure a smooth launch.

Now.. to build your rocket.. I will give a distance estimation based on some
estes charts, and personal knowledge..

Engine size |  horizontal range |  verticle range |
---------------------------------------------------
A8-3        |  200-400 ft       | 200-600ft       |
b6-4        |  300-600ft        | 300-900ft       |
C6-5        |  350-1000ft       | 400-1450ft      |
d12-5       |  600-1500ft       | 800-2300ft      | (the best! most advised)


you will want to select your engine depending on the range of the target.
Also remember..  these are MUCH heavier than normal rockets.. it is not advised 
to aim low!! aim just high of your target, depending on the distance.. For very 
long distances.. aim at a 30-45 degree angle.. Practice makes perfect. practice
with wieghted down duds before you go indiscriminatly blowing up nuke plants..

A normal rocket is made with recovery wadding, and a nice little parachute.. 
Fuck these.. This should be made the following way.

A)Take 1 paper towel.. soak it in gasoline.. 
B)Take 1 paper towel.. soak it in battery acid, and muriatic(HCL)acid. let dry
(optional ^^^)
C)Mix gasoline and gunpowder in a 3:1 ratio.. disolve thouroughly. Soak 2 paper 
towels in this and let dry.

 Now take your tube and do the following..

---------------------------------------------------------------------
  nose || gunpowder           |     C      |  B   |   A  |engine
---------------------------------------------------------------------
(a,b,c correspond to the steps listed above)

Now, there are two ways to build this rocket..

1)  Rocket will fly until out of fuel and then explode..(can be delayed)
  this is good for kiling people, scare tactics, and airplane destruction.

2)  Rocket will run out of fuel, engine will eject.. and will explode on impact.
  The uses for this are obvious, doors, cars, buildings, landforms(heh heh).

For number one.. glue the nose cone on.. and launch(more on that later)

For number two.. replace C with A.  omit c and b.  place a stopper about 1 inch 
thick in front of the engine. Glue this in.. fill the remaining space with more 
gunpowder.  Now.. take the shotgun shell, and glue it in so that the primer 
faces out the front of the rocket. Drive the nail through the nose cone, so that 
the head of the nail is at the tip of the cone. Get some more tubing and..

       ---b-----------
a------         --c-----------
-------         --------------
       ----------------

a is the nose cone, b is the extra tubing, and c is where the shotgun shell is..
the nail tip, sticking out from A should just touch the primer. put some glue 
around it to insure the placment.  B should be glued around C. and A should have 
a very WEAK bond to b.

When the rocket hits cone first.. the bond between a and b breaks. this causes 
the nail to break the primer, and set off the shell.. causing a VERY nasty 
explosion.


Ok.. now the last part.. the engine...
Take your engine.. and make a slow burning fuse... 15-20 seconds should be 
enough.. (depending on how fast you want the rocket going off)..
Now.. Scrape a larger hole out of the clay in the back.(use a drill bit)
FIll this with gunpowder and a fuse. place a little glue on the end to hold it
all in.


To launch..  place the straw(from the rocket) on the dowel(in the tube). Get a 
lighter.. Light the fuse. Tilt the tube back so the rocket falls back into the 
tube. DO NOT PUSH IT IN YOURSELF..(I shouldn't need to explain this one!)
Aim the tube, and wait for the rocket to fire.. hold steady.. this mutha kicks 
one damn ass punch! Also.. wear goggles.. don't be an idiot.


NOTE- The engine bit can also be done with the regular igniters from a rocket.. 
but remember.. they have a 50% failure rate.. so by gaining an electrical push 
button system.. you can lose your launch speed.. and possibly your life!



What to use this for..

  These rockets will be refered to as TYPE A (launch/explode) and type B
(launch/impact/explode). Type a is normally used to cause a BIG fireball in the
middle of nowhere..  but if launched into somebodies stomach.. can be quite
cool! Also this type is used to blow up aircraft, due to the phenominal aim you
would need to actually HIT the plane.. this can take it out as long as you get
near the craft.. and time it right.  These are also used to destroy crowds..
This tactic is quite deadly!Launching one of these into a crowd is like blowing
up a bomb in the middle. These rocket tubes are comparable to RPGs and
bazookas!!

Type B is used to take out tanks, cars, doors, buildings and other assorted non
moving objects. The explosion from type B is MUCH bigger than a.. but will not
travel as far!  Type B can also be used to set off a pre-planted explosive
somewhere by aiming at the general vicinity.


So.. when you've got a big gang fight to go to.. and your out numbered 10:1.. 
bring good ol Nellie the RT along.. when they see a rocket shoot out of that 
tube and blow up the swingset.. they'll run like hell!!  Or maybe your fighting 
a civil war... playing war games.. or whatever..
Just remember.. This was brought to YOU by the FBI.. and GarbLeD USeR.

Note- If the engine fires and the rocket does not leave the tube.. Chuck the 
tube .. and hit the deck.. you fucked up somewhere.. and the rocket will still 
explode!!!
Also- These tubes are REUSABLE.. so you can make 400 rockets, and only need one 
tube... but try and re-grease it FREQUENTLY.. otherwise the above may happen to 
YOU!
Also.. the first time you make this.. try it without the dowel in the middle.. 
sometimes it works better with, and sometimes better without. I suppose it
depends on the quality of the rocket.

       And other assorted easy-to-do-detonations!

Yes.. FBI and GaRbLeD UseR bring you another informing, wonderful article.. 
This article is based on the need for weaponry.. FAST, and cheap.

   Example 1-  Your house is surrounded by urban terrorists, they want your
girlfriend to come out, naked, with her hands up.  What do you do??

   Example 2-  Your nextdoor neighbor has noticed a few STRANGE smoke clouds
coming from your home, and has decided to call the Feds. Too bad you have 30
kilos of coke stashed under your bed. WHat to do???!

   Example 3-  Your best freind has been taken hostage by the KGB, and is 
being held in a warehouse 1000 ft. away. He has 30 minutes to live.. No car,
No ready made weapons.  WHAT WILL YOU DO?!?!?

Well.. aside from the corny examples, you pull out this article.

  How will this ASCII save your best friend from the KGB?  Easy, It teaches 
you a simple fact. That every household in america contains enough explosives
to detonate a city block. No way.. uh uh.. you say.. Well... READ ON!!

  The Gerbil Feed Bomb
BY:Acid Reign

  This is a simple weapon.. Have a pet? Small rodent perhaps??

Modeling Cement?? EVEN better!
Great, now get some gasoline, a glass jar, and a wick. (See later text for
how to on wicks!)

Take the glass jar, Powder up the pet food, (preferably green pellets but the
little cylindyrs do nicely) Now take the modeling cement.. POUR it in. Mix
thouroughly.. Now that you've TOTALLY emptied about 2 glue containers into
the mixture. Fill the rest of the bottle with gasoline.(did I forget to mention
the gerbil feed should only about half fill the container?) Shake. 
Now take Mr.Wick Put it in through the top. Light, run, hit the dirt!!!

VERY powerful.. one went off in Beirut and killed 57 people!!


  The BIC BomB!
BY:Garbled User

     This is a very simple, and powerful grenade, and can be made MORE powerful
with some BB's and glue. Take a lighter, preferably with LOTS of fluid.(BIC
disposable) Pull the metal thing off the top, now pull the little wheel out.

     Optional:Coat with glue and roll in BB's!
     
     Now.. Light the little plastic bits at the top(heat until they bubble!)
and THROW!!  Should make a nice BIG fireball. If you included the optional step
watch your opponents die from a shotgun-like blast!


  Generic Pipe Bomb
By:Garbled USer

        This simple bomb can be made many many wayz!!

1) FIll with assorted explosive powders(match heads, Rocket Engines, rust,
aluminum powder, or whatever else you have laying around that looks deadly!)

2) Same as method 1. Omit the part about drilling the hole for the fuse.
simply fill a MR. COFFEE filter with DAMP Nitrogen Triiodide(discused later)
and put in one(or both) end(s) of the pipe. Unviel,throw, Enjoy!

3) The ol' Gunpowder and wick works too.. but can be donw with shotgun shells
too!!


  Exploding Arrows
By:Garbled User

        Another simple bomb. Get the following.
Shotgun primer(from UNFIRED shell)
BB.
Glue.
Bow 
Aluminum arrow.
Gunpowder.

     Fill the arrow with gunpowder. Glue the primer to the end of the arrow.
Glue the BB to end of the primer. Shoot at your intended enemy. Watch him die in
pain as the arrow explodes! This also tends to produce millions of little
shards of aluminum, which can be quite deadly when accelerated(say,.. by an
explosion).
(as allways, gunpowder can be replaced by many other things..)


   Gunpowder Replacements (for the anarchist in a jam for time)
BY:Garbled User
Simple replacements for gunpowder.

  Rocket engine powder(ground up)
  Ground up match heads
  Emptied out bullets and shells.
  Emptied out Bottle rockets and other assorted fireworks.
  
These replacements will do nicely in a REAL jam.  And even when you have
the right equipment.. Most of these work equally or better than the real
thing. Except maybe the match heads.. they have a knack for being more like
flash powder.. but are still comparable!!


   Quick Wicks
BY:GArbled uSer

  These wicks aren't the best.. but do OK in a jam.
Take any burning string(except nylon, if it melts when burned, it's nylon!)
Get some acetone(nail polish remover) and gunpowder(or ground up charcoal if
in a SERIOUS jam. (you is bummin!) Mix in 1:1 ratio. Dip string in mixture.
Let the ACETONE soak in for awhile. Let dry. Repeat about 10 times.

This should give you a VERY NICE WICK!!

   Blast Oil
BY:Garbled User

  This is a strange liquid..  Take a Plastic peanut butter jar,(or any plastic
jar) Fill up with half nail polish remover and half 99% iso-propyl alcohol.
Either-
A) Ignite mixture, run fast
B) Ignite bottle, throw fast
C) Pour on target, Light and run fast!!

if used properly.. it sometimes has a nasty property of causting the entire
mixture to become gaseous.. INSTANTLY.. this can cause a TREMENDOUS exlosion!!
  One note.. Try to get 99% pure Iso-Propyl Alcolhol.. The lesser the purity, 
the lesser the chance of explosion.. Same with the acetone!
BE CAREFUL!!

   Force Grenade
BY:GArbled User

  This little bastard will blow just about anyone 30-100 feet back!! Can cause
a car to nearly flip over.. and can cause almost nuclear damage to a window!

 Simply Grab the vineger, grab the ol ARM and HAMMER baking soda. Take a
cheap plastic bottle(2 liter is good). Take some paper towels.Fill them with
alot of baking soda. Wrap them VERY thoughroughly(but small enof to still fit
thru the neck of the bottle). FIll the bottle about 60% up with vineger. TAke
the baking soda rolls you made(about 10) and drop them in. then just
 close, and throw.. FAST!! The reaction causes a HUGE amount of CO2 gas
to be produced.. causing a BIG BOOM!
You can ALSO use a glass bottle, which will create MANY nice, sharp glass 
shards! Which function nicely as an anti-personel device.

   Death Grenade
BY:Garbled User

  This is the same as a force grenade, except the minor fact that it releases
a cloud of poison gas SO deadly it will kill just about anyone nearby!
(not to mention the sheer power of the bomb!)
Just replace the Arm-n-hammer with any ammonia containing liquid (ammonia Water
works the best (ammonium hydroxide))
Replace the vineger with a chlorine containing liquid, like industrial strength
chlorine bleach.
Ever wonder why they allways tell you not to mix the two?? Now you know.. they
produce chlorine gas.
heh heh..
This will produce QUITE a blast.. and a green cloud that will sweep a city
block.. so try not to be downwind of the bomb!! It will also take longer to
explode..So you have more time to throw the grenade.. BUT Don't be thinking...
"Gee, I have all the time in the world.. I think I'll have a few cigs before I
throw this" Or you will end up looking VERY dead. By more time I mean about 10-
15 more seconds added to the safety margin before the thing HAS to be thrown!

Another STRANGE thing you can do with this one is, tie a turpentine soaked rag
around the bottle.. (DO NOT LIGHT) This will react with the chlorine, and catch
on fire, releasing TONS of black smoke.. and an interestingly noxious smell..
which is also probably very dangerous. (No I'm not sure.. Would YOU stand near
a death grenade to find out whether or not it was deadly??)


   Fire Grenade
BY:Garbled User

   Quite simple. Same as above two.  Use Calcium Carbide and water.
Harder to do because CaC2 is NOT usually a houshold chemical.. Unless your wife
is a speliologist.
Now.. Simply tie a gasoline soaked rag to the bottle, light, throw.. run.

SHould make a nice, big.. powerful blast.. emitting a HUGE fireball!!
This should be used with a glass bottle, be advised.. if you throw the bottle
to hard.. it will break, causing a not-so-awesome explosion..
Of course.. when using glass you could allways cushion the outside!

All of these should be thrown as soon as they are closed.. The gases they 
produce are quite harmful.. and being nearby when one explodes is ALLWAYS a bad 
idea!!

   Propane/Butane Bomb
BY:Acid Reign. Also added to by GArbled User

    Well, this bomb was constructed by us in an attempt to not only make an
antipersonnel device which was easy to construct, but also to create the
biggest fireball that the world has ever seen.  So, you get the power of pure
butane, with the added advantage of simplicity in construction...have phun!

    1.  A Cannister of Butane Fuel: Easy to obtain, this can be found at just
        about any good drugstore, certainly at a hardware store.
    2.  Gun Powder: See above.
    3.  Plastic Container: Preferably a TupperWare-(tm) glass, as it will both
        melt away and explode, while glass will shatter with heat, and metal
        will not explode.
    4.  A Fuse: You can buy these in places, but if you don't want to go thru
        the hassle, simply rub model glue all over a string, it'll work just
        as well.
    5.  Masking Tape: Or electrical tape, or cellophane tape, or whatever kind
        of tape that you've got lying 'round the house.
 Assembly
    1.  Fill the plastic container with 1/4 to 1/2 inch of powder.
    2.  Center the butane in the container, atop the powder.
    3.  Fill the rest of the container with powder, around the butane.  Pack
        it down -- lightly, just so that it fully fills in the container.
    4.  Insert the fuse at least 1/2 inch into the powder, and pack the
        surrounding powder as in step 3.  Seal the top of the container around
        the butane with a small covering of masking tape.
    5.  Plant the device in a target area.
    6.  Light the fuse, and...
    7.  RUN LIKE HELL!!
    8.  (Detonation): If this is done correctly, and you get well out of range
        of the fireball, the immediate, (and non-immediate), area will be "up
        in smoke," persay.

______________________________________________________________________________
Now for the Garbled User enhancements!!!

 Use propane instead of Butane.
 Use an oxygen tank along with the butane/propane.(BIG WHITE BOOM!!)
 Ever see those HUGE propane canisters used in outdoor BBQ's? Get the idea?!?
 No oxygen tanks?? Use Whipped Cream(in the spray container)
 No butane/propane?? Use WD40 or other aerosols!! (WD40 and other lubricants 
 are the best tho)

All of these should make your little butane bomb capable of nuking a city..
Or.. just drop yours off by the local propane cylinder exhange at your corner
store.. heh heh..

Of course.. there are those HUGE propane canisters.(6-20 ft long!!)
those would be fun to watch.


   Nitrogen Tri-iodide.
BY:Garbled User

  Simple enof.  Take alot of ammonia water, mix with 3-4 bottles of iodine.
Shake for 5 minutes. Filter through MR Coffee filter about 10 times.
Let dry.

A) You now have a crimson substance with explosive properties, and a nasty
temper.. (Extremely shock sensitive)
B) You may also use the liquid over again..(Re mix with iodine. make more!!)
You have a virtually endless supply, as long as you have Iodine bottles, you
have explosives!!


   PeroOxyacetone
BY:GArbled User

  A useful chemical. These aren't exact measurements.. but when you are in a
hurry.. you could care less.
50/50 Acetone/Hydrogen Peroxide.
add 10 drops Muriatic(pool) acid.

Have fun with white filtrate.The Filtrate is somewhat SHOCK SENSITIVE.. so be
advised not to stomp on, hit, mutilate or whatever while in possesion.
The main way of setting this off though is to use a wick, or fire of some 
sort.. I suppose it could be used as a replacement for gunpowder.. but I 
haven't tried. Also.. It usually takes a few hours to complete the reaction.. 
so be patient.. Try heating it in a 40C water bath.. that should speed it up 
alot!


   Tennis Ball Bomb
BY:Acid Reign

SImple enof. Take tennis ball, strike anywhere matches, gunpowder. Cut the
heads off the matches. Open up the tennis ball. Fill the tennis ball with those
match heads. Pour in some gunpowder for kick. Seal the hole up with rubber
cement and duct tape.. Throw at your enemy(very hard!) watch fun as he dies!!
These little pukes are quite powerful.. but take QUITE a shock to set off! My
advice is to practice your pitching skills before taking on an enemy with
these.. or you could end up dead, and laughed at.  Also.. NEVER SQUEEZE!!!!
One time we moved a 50 lb park bench about a foot with one. Imagine the fun you
could have, if you made a HUGE batch of these, got a car, and one of those nice
MR. TENNIS PRACTICE SERVERS. You know.. The ones that shoot tennis balls out at
high speeds for court practice!! You could take out a fucking niegborhood!!


   Basic Moltov Cocktail
BY:Garbled User

   60% oil, 40% gasoline. Wine bottle filled with mixture,rag soaked in
mixture. Cork.

Put rag in bottle, so most of it sticks out. Cork the bottle. Light the rag.
Throw at intended target. The bottle will break, releasing the oil/gas mixture.
The burning rag will ignite this, and the whole area will be covered in fire!

  Now to have fun, replace oil with styrofoam!! NOW watch the fun when it
explodes!!

Of course you could allways use Blast Oil instead of gasoline.. :)

   Spray Bottle Flamethrower.
BY:GArbLed UsEr

    Even EASIER..  Get one of your nice little spray bottles,(mom or wife uses
them to water houseplants). Fill with one of many liquids..
  * Blast Oil
  * Gasoline
  * Ethyl or Iso-propyl Alcolhol
    Boiling Water
    Ammonia Water
    Chlorine Bleach
  * Naptha(lighter fluid)
    Drano(or other like fluids)
  * Nail polish Remover
Now.. If it has an asterick beside it.. SImply pull out MR lighter, and hold in
front of the blast! Turn to MIST for a deathly fireball, or STREAM for a nice
line of deadly fire! For the other liquids, ALLWAYS USE STREAM!! TRy to aim for
the face. If you can hit the eyes, any of these are guaranteed to blind the
enemy.

No spray bottles?? Look under the sink.. Maybe a WINDEX bottle, OR.. if you
have children.. a squirt gun will do nicely. Be warned! Many of these liquids
will eat through plastic! So if your weapon catches on fire.. THROW! Do not
attempt to put it out! Also try and use them quickly.. or you may end up
covered in DRANO! (The tip of the weapon will occasionally catch on fire.. this
is OK.. but be careful and put it out.. the tip may melt.. and you is toast
when it does!!

  Quick formula for HIGH EXPLOSIVES!
BY:GArbled USEr

 Quite easy. 88% Ammonium nitrate
             12% Charcoal powder.
(See below on how to get Ammonium Nitrate)


     So.. as you can see.. The modern anarchist is supplied with what he needs,
by the very entity he uses it to destroy!  In a single house alone.. there is
probably enough explosives to take a nice big building down! By simply walking
down to the corner store.. many more are found.. Butane fuel,
fireworks...alcolhols.. the whole bit! Your local hardware store sells nice
stuff like aluminum powder, toulene(!!!!) and pipes! Plus other assorted
goodies if you know what to look for. The grocery store has even MORE! Instant
cold packs. They are just water and AMONIUM NITRATE!! heh heh.. I need say no
more.

     So.. my advice to you, the budding young anarchist... Go to your favorite
store.. Read lables.. If it sez DO NOT MIX WITH blah blah. MIX IT!! If it sez
to keep away from fire, drop a match in it. Look for your neccesary anarchy
ingredients in your favorite products.. and if you are lucky enough.. You may
find EXACTLY what you were looking for!

     The Evolution Of Cubes.

    Oh no..


  This is exactly what you are thinking to yourself as you read this.. Not 
ANOTHER F.B.I paper!! Spare me..

  Heh heh heh.. It's too late!! You've allready read the title.. You are 
doomed to continue now.

     You may have learned about evolution in biology, or possibly from a local 
fanatic. But they never told you the truth... What ALL scientists fear...
 The Cube Theory.
   Yes. over the years, the inane theory has been put down, over and over.. 
mainly by evolutionists that fear the truth..  But now the theory has been 
revised, and the street clinics, and back alley liposuctions can come to an 
end now..  Yes.. the theory is being made public.. By your socially concious 
freind at the F.B.I.  GaRbLeD uSeR..

=============================================================================
| "Billyons and Billyons of people hate this theory!" -Carl Sagan, infidel. |
=============================================================================

     Millions of years ago.. a small spark began on the earth, who knows what 
caused it.. Some say blind luck. Others argue supernatural interference. But 
only the cubists can explain this theory..

     We must go back, 20.. no.. 30.. 40 billion years. The Big Bang.  This 
event has still mystified scientists and dope addicts alike for many years 
now.  But this.. is the answer to the cube theory.

     It is thought that at this time, a black hole of tremendous mass, 
existed, and it's own great mass caused a mighty catastrophic explosion. 
Giving birth to Galaxys, Stars, Planets, Landforms.. and later, curious little 
beings who like to discuss trees.  This has always been refuted by the simple 
question, "What was there before the big bang??"

     To find this answer, go to your local Post office.

      Yes.. just a day ago last year, the Wonderful U.S. Postal service lost 
my package. I spent over a hundred dollars mailing 19 cubic meters of lead to 
my freind as a birthday present.  The post office lost it.  HOW could ANYONE, 
even one as incompetent as a post office employee, loose 19 cubic meters of 
LEAD?!  The answer came to me today. 
     It was sucked into a space time vortex, and landed in the past..
40 billion years in the past to be specific! See the tie.  The universe began 
due to the hard, dilligent work of our US postal service men and weomen.  If 
it wasn't for their contstant incompetence, and lack of common sence, the 
universe would not exist today. oops.. Back to the story.
     As I was saying, this huge cube of metal JUST happened to land on an 
energy fluxuation. This energy compressed the cube to the size of a cat.  Then 
the energy began to take the form of the cube, and the cube was replicated, 
and this was repeated, over and over. Soon the mass became tremendous, and the 
entire cube collapsed upon itself. A great explosion soon followed. This was 
the fabled Big Bang. 
     
     Soon the stars were formed, and our little sun came to be. And what a 
nice sun it is.  This gave birth to a world, full of little beings, that would 
soon fufil their niche in the universe, to create it. Should this world have 
been destroyed before the completion of my task.. we would never have existed.

You can thank me later.

     So next time you see that postal service worker walking down the street, 
stop him. Thank him for your existance.  If he weren't so incredibly stupid.. 
you wouldn't be around!

 Don't let the Trees getcha!

No.. I won't let you...
 AIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
How could you!!.. It's all over....  I depart.. from the realm.. of the sane..

Present..
              How to Idiot Hack.

     Say what?? You want into your fave unix,vax, or whatever system.. but you 
don't have an account?
Well you could allways BRUTE FORCE hack an account.. But this is a waste of 
time.. and most times doesn't work..

Instead.. you IDIOT hack..

     Yes.. the sad truth about users of School Mainframes is.. They have no 
idea what they are doing!

All you need is a list of accounts on the system you hope to hack..
Ask around to the local hackers.. maybe they have a few.. or if you can get 
in.. youve got it made..

Simply.

more /ect/passwd

this will show you the ENTIRE userlist for the system.

capture this..

Now hangup and logon again..

Take the first account and go to the login prompt..
(I will use Unix for an example here..)

Login:gwbempky
Password:.........

Well.. what do you do?? You need a password.. It's actually quite simple.. 90% 
of the users have the SAME PASSWORD AS THIER LOGIN NAME.

So.. just go down the list, pump int the user name , then pump it in again for 
the password. I guarantee you will get at LEAST 1-10 acounts that way.. simply 
find one that hasn't been used in a LONG time.(It will tell you the last login 
when you logon) Now type passwd or something like that and commendeer the 
account.. Or to make it last longer.. just leave it alone and try to erase all 
traces of your existance.  Chances are the user is a fool, so you can trick him 
with simple things like hidden dirs!

just type
mkdir .programs
this will create a dir named .programs  that will only show up if the user 
typed ls -lt *

This system is PROVEN to work.. I have found 10 out of 15 attempts to work!!
After that.. it got so hilariously funny I couldn't continue and just 
comendeered one.

So.. Get a userlist.. and HACK!! HACK HACK HACK!! And enjoy your new 
UNIX/VAX/WHATEVER accounts!

Now.. to find out if your host has this feature enter Kermit, and type "?"
If it sez dial.. you are in BUisiness!!

Simply type the following commands..

help dial
help set line
help set modem
help set speed

this should give you an idea of what yer up against.

First thing to do.. is to set the modem..
type   set modem ?
this will give you a nice list of modems to chose from.. you should choose 
Hayes.. this is usually the best..

Now type set line ?
this will tell you what to set the line to!! In my case I have to CWD to /dev
then type  set line tty
Now type set speed to whatever value.

YOU have an outdial!!

Now type

dial 13156560846

this will dial the Realm Of Nihilism..
if not.. you did something wrong..
after it screws around fer awhile.. type connnect at the prompt..
and there's yer terminal screen!!

now download whatever you want..(AT 9600!!) and use the bbs normally..

now you can exit.. and download everything from your unix site using 
kermit(yuk!)..  Slow.. but FREE!!

BTW- I advise against using this feature if you have a legit account! the 
school may just BILL you!! ($953.45 for 34 calls to Syracuse NY)

heh heh.. have fun.. and Thank GarbLed UseR for opening a new door in Pirating!

GarBled UseR bids you farewell.. happy hacking..

supports Phreaking, hacking, and anarchy. We are also willing to support just 
about anything you send in! Send us in a carding file, we'll print it up!! The 
only reason this issue was mainly ANARCHY was the fact that I (GarBled UsEr) 
specialize in anarchy.. and I wrote most of these articles!!

     Unfortunately.. we have a few rules concerning articles submitted to us.

1) No disclaimer is nessecary, as a general disclaimer will be put at the end 
of each newsletter! Putting a disclaimer in will just cause unneeded hassle for 
our poor editors.

2) In anarchy and Chemistry articles, all measurements must be in the following 
units.. or your article may not be accepted!
Temperature - CELCIUS!!
Distance    - Meter(metric)
Volume      - Liter(metric)
Mass        - Gram(Metric)
Please help us keep a standard in our newsletters by conforming to these 
standards.. If you wrote the file in english system originaly, please take the 
time to convert..

3) Please submit only original articles, written by yourself(or copied from a 
book by you). Please do not submit articles that you also submitted to 12 
different newsletters.  If you send it to us, and follow these guidelines, it 
WILL be accepted.

4) Try to keep all Headers and credits to about 5 lines at the beginning and 
the end of the files.. This will keep our little publication neat for any of 
you readers.


     Also.. If you would like a subscription to our publication.. Simply send 
us a message saying so. We are non profit, and therefore we will mail a printed 
copy of the newsletter out(prior to national release, so YOU are one of the 
first to get the issue!) postage due. This may sound like we are cheap, but 
this way nobody gets cheated, and we get to remain anonymous.  Also.. we need 
your address to send you mail.. :)

NOTE- Our internet accounts do not allow for the sending of mail outside of our 
system.. therefore it will be impossible to respond to your messages. So don't 
go around thinking we hate you because we never responded..

         Hey,   you  guessed  it,  here  it is again..  FBI's 2nd issue.. We're
     sorry  for   the   delay,  we   took   a   little   vacation,  literally..
     Be  looking  for  the  next  release  sometime  around  the  end  of Sept.
     Well, on with the articles!

*******************************************************************************


   Aye... it's the Sentinel again... back with another kicking bomb idea... its
the FBI
              Death Grenade Two!

     Start  out  by  reading  the  previous   carbide.fbi  text  in  the  first
newsletter. Put the baloon  in... as directed,  but first  make sure its pretty
dry ( set it out somewhere for a  day... or use a hair dryer, etc.. ) then toss
some vinegar and some Sodium Ferrocyanide ( a crystalized substance... mine was
blue ) then throw in the calcium carbide. ( for a better bomb,  put the CC in a
separate  holder, if the bottle top is big enough ) Now, put this  outside away
from people for a few  days...  so the vinegar and the  Sodium Ferrocyanide can
make Hydrogen Cyanide (i think) anyways, after the few days,if the bomb dosen't
explode (make sure its in a cool place, FAR away from anything living ( and NOT
the fridge ) you shake it so the baloon bursts and mixes with the CC.  Put this
somewhere where the victim is going to go  (you have about 30 seconds before it
goes off) also, leave a burning rag next to it. this will cause an explosion of
acytylene gas, hydrogen  cyanide, flame and  shattered glass  at about 300 FPS.
the kill range is about 5 feet. the Fuck up really bad range is up to about 10-
15 feet. If you watch this go off... make sure yer 80-100 feet away because the
cyanide  gas  goes FAR.  If you just want  an explosion,  just use  the CC  and
water... its not QUITE as deadly. NOTE: I havent wanted to kill anyone that bad
recently, and hence, this recipe hasn't been tested. So be careful.

        Garbled UseR and the   FBI   present...

                T  H  E    S  O  D  A    C  A  N  .  .  .  .
Just one more part of  "The Militant's Militia"


        This is one of  the most deadly, evil,  vile, destuctive and just plain
dire  explosive  devices  known  to  the  FBI.  This  weapon  operates  on  the
"Deadman's  Switch"  theory, but is easily  disguised as an  innocent recylable
object.  The  reason it is so  demonic, is that once it is set, merely TOUCHING
the device will  set it off.  Thus one  could place it on a  doorstep, behind a
car, or just  in the middle of the street  where some  innocent passer-by could
mistakenly set  it  off.  Even  worse,  some  cheap  fool,  or  environmentally
concious  person  could  set  it  off.  Depending on what type of explosive you
use, and whether  or not you add  shrapnel, the device's power could range from
a small flare, to a tremendous detonation!

        The concept  is quite simple, and will be given in an easy step by step
format, for your reading pleasure. :)

1.  Decide  what you  want to do with the bomb, to use it as a scare tactic, or
    to detonate a city block, or maybe just a small, but powerfull explosion.

2.  Pick up the following ingredients for the bomb:
       (1)   Aluminum can used for soda or beer.  Ranging from 12oz and up.
       (1)   Spool of wire, any color. Preferably solid. Fone wire works nice.
       (1)   Mercury Switch.(optional)
       (1)   Mini SPST Switch.
       (1)   SPST pushbutton switch. Normally ON.
       (1)   Spool of solder, and a nice iron. Neatness counts!
       (1)   Nine Volt Battery.

2A.     Now  here's  where your decision in step 1 counts.. If you want a scare
        tactic, Pick  up  some  flash powder (or flare powder) and a  nice 1.5V
        flashlight bulb. ( convieniently available at  your local RADIO-SHACK )

2B. WHAT!? You want to detonate a city block?!  You are a lunatic!  We must get
    together  some  time.  Go  to  your local  store and  pick up some ammonium
    nitrate ( instant  coldpacks,  or fertilizer ).  Now Aquire,  or make ( not
    advised )  a nice #8 blasting cap.   On second thought, making one might be
    better for your purposes, because you can make it MILITARY style. (75% more
    powerful then conventional blasting caps. )  #8's  have  a tendency  not to
    work well with Ammonium Nitrate.

2C. Just a nice routine explosion eh?  Pick up a  flashlight bulb ( 1.5V )  and
    some gun powder, or black powder.

3.  Take your  nice, innocent  can,  and empty the contents.  Cut the top CLEAR
    off right  under the rim.  DON'T Be messy, if you bend the can, start over.
    Neatness makes the bomb WORK.

4.  Drill a hole in  the direct center  of the  bottom  of the can,  barely big
    enough to  thread the  pushbutton switch  in, and secure  it with the handy
    bolt that comes with it.

5.  Now cut a small rectangular hole, near the inside edge of  the botom of the
    can to house the mini switch.

6.  OK, the CAN section of your process is  complete.  Time for  the hard part.
    Hope you can solder.
        Here is a nice, cheap ASCII diagram.. yes it sux.. but watcha gonna do?

   Ok, now that I've wasted your precious time with that horrid diagram, I will
explain it.  The Wires leading to and from the mercury switch are NOT TO BE PUT
in if the mercury switch is omited.

        Simply enough, The current goes through the wires to the first  switch,
if the  first switch is ON, it goes to the  next switch,  If this switch is on,
It goes to the  detonator, which in turn explodes the  device.  I reccomend you
test your circuit with a multi-tester before you  go about  construction of the
bomb.  This will help to assure a NON-DUD.  I advize  that you  remove the nice
detonator before doing this, unless of course you are a massochist.

7.   You managed to follow the diagram and constructed the WORKING(optimal word
     here ) circuit.  OK..  now the fun begins.  Place the pushbutton switch in
     it's proper  hole, and  secure.  Do the  same with  the mini switch.  Tape
     the good ol nine-volt battery to the inside of the can. Add some epoxy for
     safety's sake.  MAKE SURE NO WIRES  TOUCH  EACHOTHER!  IF THEY DO.. well..
     alas.. a good militant was he.

8.    OK, fill the can up about 1/4th the way up with your explosive of choice.
      Pack if  desired.  Get a  small  amount of  shrapnel if  desired and  add
      generously.  Add  no  more  than  1/4th  the  total  wieght  of  the can.

9.   If you  opted to use the  mercury switch, place that here.  Place it in a
     manner so that if the can  is moved from  the vertical  direction it will
     set off the detonator.

10. If you  are  mercury-less place the detonator here. If you used the  switch
    fill  the can  with enough  explosives to cover  your newly  placed switch.
    If you have used the flashlight  bulb, now is the  time to  CAREFULLY break
    the bulb, WITHOUT damaging the filament.. test with a multi-tester.. If you
    screw up.. your bad luck.

11. If you used the  switch, place  your  detonator here.  In either case, fill
    the can the rest of the way up.

12. Get out the epoxy and glue the top back on.

     You have just made a soda can..  Now, if you are proceding with this file,
before  reading it completely, you are probably dead about now.  Here's why you
died:

   During the final stages, you  left the mini switch  ON.  This is  the arming
switch, and should ONLY be used during testing, and planting.

   You managed to build up a large  amount of static electricity and discharged
it into a can  full of  explosives.  Bad move.  Use  ANTI-Static spray to avoid
this.

   You did this by a nice, warm open fire. Or better  yet you smoked nearby the
device.  Bravo on an excellent demise.

   You left  the device stiing in your nice hot window  sill, where it exploded
killing your family. I applaud you.

   You  decided  my instructions  weren't  good  enough for you, and WINGED it.

   You let some wires touch in the  final stage of  construction. Avoid this by
coating  all  wires and  leads with  melted plastic, or use electical tape. The
first method is prefered.

Well, If you got this far.. you are alive. (I hope!!)

        OK, you have yer nice,  prepared device, and wish to plant it.  This is
simple.  Sort  of.  There  is  a  danger  factor  involved,  so  be forewarned.

        Take the  device  to the  site.  DO  NOT  arm it until it is  absolutly
ready! This is  CRITICAL !  The easiest place to put is is on a raised platform
such as a door step.  Place  the can on  the edge  of the step, make sure it is
perfectly vertical.  The Pushbutton switch should be  pushed in now, and in the
OFF position.  Now  CAREFULLY arm the device.  CAREFULLY slide it over to about
the  center of  the door step, so  that it gets  kicked over when someone steps
outside.  If you  used the mercury switch, you now realize why it  is optional.
If you move the can too fast, the switch will detonate you.

        If you  are  placing  this on a  large flat surface, using  the mercury
switch is HIGHLY advised against!  Place  a VERY thin sheet of paperboard under
your can, compressing the bottom switch.  Poke a hole in the bottom of the can,
so that it can be armed.  Arm the device, and place it on the ground. Push down
on the top of the device, and SLOWLY remove  the paperboard.  If the paperboard
was thin enough you survived.

        Get the hell out of there, and  DO  yourself a favor, and wear gloves..
finger prints are WAY uncool.

        Ok,  The  mercury switch is  VERY VERY  dangerous, but it also makes it
absolutely  impossible  to  disarm the  bomb  should  someone discover it.  The
paperboard can  be simply  cut away  from the  edges in the  flat surface bomb.
this can be extremely  useful in circumstances  where you are  placing the bomb
in an area  that is very  bumpy, or rocky, like loose sand or  dirt.  Or if you
just prefer to keep your life.

        How Your Bomb Works:
   Well, simply enough, once it is armed, if the pushbutton  switch is released
the circuit  will be completed.  With  the mercury  switch added, if either the
switch or  the button  is tripped, it  will explode.  The current  will set off
the  detonator, or  if  you  used  the  flashlight bulb, It will  cause a  high
intensity  flame to  be produced  for about  1-2 seconds.  This is quite enough
to explode any light explosive.

   To tell  you the truth, you can use any explosive  that you desire with this
bomb.  One time  I even saw one of these made completely of THERMITE. Holy shit
the  whole  can just  melted, and fused  with the  road tar.   If you want, you
can use plastique, or just pour in some nitroglycerine(HA!).

Basically, it's up to you.. and it's your life.  So have fun.

      Eight line wiring.. The New Standard?

Choice excerpts from "Telephone Inside Wire Standards"

   Brought to you by Garbled User

        Well, here I was,  on vacation..  looking around my room here..  Lo and
Behold... what's this?!  New inside wiring standards.. 8 LINES??  Yep.  They've
changed the wires.. no more red right ring for us...

   The following is a bunch of quotes, and paragraphs from the pamphlet, I only
took the good stuff out.. the rest is just  " You and your telephone " garbage.

My comments to the various quotes will appear after the ">" sign.

"This  brochure  covers  most  inside  wire  applications.  You can also obtain
information about approved wire and equipment from local  building and hardware
stores,  electrical  supply  stores  or your  local public  library.  For  more
technical, detailed standards you may purchase the Standard Proposal No.1558-B,
which  addresses, "Residential  and Light Commercial  Telecommunications Wiring
Standards" by contacting the  Telecommunications  Institute of America ( TIA ),
2001  Pennsylvania  Avenue  NW,  9th floor,   Washington,  DC  20006 - 1813  or
Phone (202) 457-4912. Cost is approximately $25.00."

" Wire for telephone service must be solid copper wire and should have at least
eight (8) conductors, four (4) pairs of wires.  The American National Standards
Institute ( ANSI ) standard code listing  for  this classification of wiring is
"CM", which represents "Communications Wire."   Approved wiring will be stamped
with the code "CM".

O    These wires must be individually paired and twisted together.

O    Flat wire ( i.e., undercarpet wire ) or wire not being twisted together is
     NOT ACCEPTABLE.

O    Wire smaller than 26 gauge should not be used at anytime. ( The higher the
     gauge number, the smaller the wire. )

O    The  conductors must be sheathed ( wires covered ) in an insulating jacket
        or enclosed in conduit.

Some existing  wire is only two (2) pair.  This is not considered  standard for
new installation.   Existing 2  pair is  acceptable  for  single line  service.
Four (4) pair wire  is optional  for lines  used with  computers, fax machines,
etc.  It also reduces crosstalk (interference from other  lines) and provides a
spare  pair  in  the  event  of  malfunction.  Four  ( 4 )  pair  enables  easy
installation  of  additional lines without the expense of installing new wire."

>   Whoa.  I wonder why  flat wire is  unacceptable?  And why would you want to

" One wire of a single pair of wires is for conducting voltage and the other is
for  grounding  the circuit.   The  universal  standard  color code is provided
below.

                RING/GROUND                      TIP/VOLTAGE

>     Whoa!  That sounds DAMN confusing.. How in hell are you supposed to tell
>which white wire to use! not everyone has a multitester! I'm starting to like

"Wire run distance limitations  are to be  no more than 250 feet for 22 gauge,
200 feet for  24 gauge  and 100 feet for 26 gauge.  EXCEEDING  THESE DISTANCES
COULD RESULT IN OVERLOAD OF THE WIRING SYSTEM AND CAUSE THE  TELEPHONE SETS OR
SYSTEM TO MALFUNCTION."

>and a phone, and you can obliterate them.  It must drain the voltage from the
>central office or something.. Tee hee hee.

"Each outlet in your home should have a separate set of wires which connect to
a  primary  point where  your inside  wire ends and U S WEST facilities begin.
This is called the  DEMARCATION POINT and  usually connects to a  REGISTRATION
JACK/STANDARD NETWORK INTERFACE, installed  by  U S WEST Communications, which
includes  a  protector.   The  protector  acts like a circuit  fuse preventing
harmful voltages from entering your inside wiring."

>Well I guess that means Blotto and Urine boxes are out. ::sniff::

  " FOR SAFETY  REASONS UNDER  NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CUSTOMERS OR THEIR VENDORS
PERMITTED TO  CONNECT  EITHER NEW  OR EXISTING WIRE IN ANY  WAY TO  U S WEST'S
PROTECTOR  OR  BYPASS  IN  ANY  WAY  THE  REGISTRATION  JACK/STANDARD  NETWORK
INTERFACE (DEMARCATION POINT)"

>Do you  REALLY think that's for "customer safety"?? Oh come now. Beige boxing
>is what they're afraid of.

"NOTE: BEFORE WORKING ON ANY WIRING ALWAYS UNPLUG YOUR CONNECTIONS AT U S
 WEST'S  DEMARCATION  POINT  TO  AVOID  THE  RISK  OF  ACCIDENTAL  SHOCK.
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS  WIRING CAN CARRY VOLTAGES FROM 48 TO 240 VOLTS  D.C."

 "If  you plan  on installing new wire, adding to, or rearranging your existing
telephone wire,  REMEMBER:  Telephone wiring  is intended  only for  a specific
purpose, that is, only direct (DC) low voltages.  The following  standards will
avert interference  or  problems  with your  telephone  service  or  equipment.
TELEPHONE  WIRE SHOULD NEVER BE USED  TO CONNECT AC VOLTAGES OR CURRENTS OF ANY
KIND."

        FBI presents...
 
            Di-NitroNapthalene


        Say what?

        Anywayz,  here I  go again..   This is  a relatively  odd concept,  but
I have  heard of  it being done  extensively, in commercial explosives.  Follow
the nice step-by-step instructions.

1.  Assemble the following ingrediants:
      (5)  Moth Balls.  The Napthalene kind.
      (1)  Nitric acid.  130ml
      (1)  Sulpheric Acid.  100ml
      (2)  250ml Erlynmyer flasks.
      (1)  250ml Beaker.
      (1)  Funnel.
      (5)  MR COFFEE filters.

2. That should do  nicely.  OK,  now  figure it  out  yerself!    Just kidding,
couldn't  resist!  Grind those  moth balls up  into a nice, fine powder.  Don't
even think about breathing any in.

3. Ok, this  will be done in small amounts.  I have  not personally  done this 
expirament, so  I am  advising caution.  But  I  have heard of people doing it,
using this method.

4. Mix  the nitric  acid  and the  sulpheric acid in a 50 - 50 ratio.  ADD  the
sulpheric  acid to the  nitric!  Otherwise it  will  splater!  Mix  this in the
beaker.  You will want approximately 200 ml. of the mixture.

5. Place  your  ground up powder  in the  bottom of the first flask.  Lower the
temperature of the flask to around 10 oC. This is very important, Make sure the
temperature  stays  below 12 oC!! If it gets  too High,  RUN  LIKE  THE  DEVIL.
Also, you will want  to cool the  acid off to the  same temperature, maybe even
lower.

6. Add 100ml of The acid mixture.  Keep the mixture  cool, If it starts to warm
up, try too cool it off by adding dry ice  to the ice  bath.  If all else fails
I advise a hasty retreat.

7. Let this mixture go for about 5-6  hours.  Filter off the acid, so that only
the mono-nitronapthalene  remains.  To  my knowlegde it does not dissolve.  But
if it, by some unlucky chance  does, you can  boil off  the acid, and leave the
area ( do this outside! ) until  the  acid is  gone.  Then try  to turn off the
burner without putting yourself in direct danger.

8. The next  step has been  known to  be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!  Even  worse then
trying to boil the acid off! This expirament is not for those without extensive
safety equipment.  

9.  Ok, you  have your  mono-nitronapthalene in hand ( not literally ).  Remove
it from the  flask or  filter,  wash  all the acid  off, you want NO extra acid
on this mixture!  Add this to the second flask.

10. Take your 50/50 mix,  and add 30 ml of nitric acid to it.  This should give
you  130 ml. of  the   acid  mixture,   and  it  will  be   at  an  8:5  ratio.

11. Chill the acid and the second flask to 35 oC.

12. Add the acid mixture.  Make sure the  temp does not  go above  40 oC.  This
is VERY  important.  Like  I said,  this step  is most  dangerous, use  a blast
shield, and get the hell out of the area.

13. Keep  this reaction going for about 1 day.  At the end of it, you should be
able to  filter off the  di-nitronapthalene.  If not, you know what to do. Wash
the substance, let dry, and enjoy.


        Ok.. Now this  stuff is  NOT  to  be  taken lightly, I  have seen it in
action.  It combines the worst properties of  nitroglycerine and  flash powder.
It  is  said to  be very  explosive, and  it also  is very un predictable.  One
report  says that it  usually acts  like  gunpowder,  but  one  time he left it
unconfined to dispose of some, and when he lit it, it nearly  detonated, making
a thunder that shook the ground all  around him.  He  was over  100  feet away!

        I intend to make  a batch of  this soon, and I will put the  results in
the next issue of  FBI.  If you want  to be safe, I  suggest that you  wait for
that  article.  But  for  those  of  you  with  alot  of  courage,  go  for it!

Just don't blame me if it nukes you, or doesn't work period.

*************************************************************************

        Lately  there  has been  much hullaballo  about the making,  and use of
Thermite.   Many  people state  that it  can only be lit with a vast  amount of
heat,  such  as a  burning strip of  magnesium.   Others say they  have  lit it
with  a  match.   Here I will try to give an over view of the current theories,
and let you come to your own conclusions. 

        First,  for those of  you  who may  not know, I will describe thermite,
it's uses, and basic construction.

        Thermite  is a  relatively  easy substance to  create,  being made from
ingredients  that are somewhat  simple to  obtain.  Thermite, when ignited, can
reach  temperatures  nearing  6000+  degrees  celcius,  and  has been  known to
vaporize  carbon  steel.   The  general  "formula"  for making  thermite  is as
follows:

        50%  powdered rust. (iron oxide (Fe2O3))
        50%  powdered aluminum (Al)

        Simple  enough  to  create.   Rust  can  be obtained quickly by running
a low  current  (DC)  through an  iron object, and placing the object in water.
One electrode is placed on the object, and the other in the water.  This causes
vast  amounts  of  rust  to  be  created,  which  can  easily  be  extracted by
evaporating,  or  boiling the water.   The  aluminum can generally be purchased
at  hardware  or  paint stores.   It  can  also be made,  by  taking a peice of
aluminum metal ( such as an aluminum door frame,  or pipe. ) and shaving it off
with a metal file.

        I have heard from some people,  that thermite is not very picky in it's
ingredients.   One  report  states that  he ripped  apart an  aluminum can with
his  bare  hands, leaving peices roughly .5cm in diameter.  He then proceded to
make some  regular thermite, with powdered aluminum.  He had made approximately
a  bucket full  of the  large  aluminum  thermite,  and sprinkled  two to three
handfulls of the  regular thermite  on the top.   He  then lit the mixture with
a strip  of magnesium,  and let it burn.  The entire mixture burned quite well,
actually  setting a fence nearly  15 feet away on fire from the heat alone.  If
this  is true,  then  large amounts of thermite,  would  be  much  easier for a
person  to  create,  than if  he had  to use  powdered  aluminum for the entire
mixture.  It would also be MUCH cheaper.

        The  other report  I heard,  stated that  the  ignition  temperature of
thermite,  depended  mainly  on the  grade  of aluminum.   He stated by getting
the  finest  grade  mesh  of aluminum powder he could find, he effectively made
the thermite more  sensitive.   He  stated that this  mixture led to less heat,
but,  also ignited with  greater ease.  So much greater ease, that he ignited a
small  handfull  of the substance, by simply dropping  a  wooden match into the
mixture.   Such  an  easy to  use substance  would  have obvious uses,  such as
being the  ignition  for regular thermite,  which could then even  ignite large
thermite.   This  would also  make thermite  igniteable  by  wicks,  and  minor
blasts.   This  could make a VERY dangerous weapon should it be put in a rocket
or shrapnel bomb.

I hope you found this article interesting.. I certainly had alot of fun reading
up on these topics, and finally putting them into cyberspace.

                      Just in case you hadn't had enough...
                             yes... its yet another.

                                 FORCE GRENADE!




     Yep, its another  stupid  destructive file  from the FBi... one note... in
case you were wondering, "Where's  the phreaking  files.. you are the PHREAKERS
bureau...  aren't you?" well,  rumor has it on Garbled User's extended vacation
he just might have made one... maybe. <grin>

     On to the force grenade... Al(s) and HCl(l) react to form Hydrogen... Just
in case yer  REAL stupid... this  means, take a  big bottle  ( 2 litres are the
standard... all though I don't know how they'll fare with the acid) and roll up
some tubes or crunch up some balls of ALUMINUM foil... NOT tinfoil, then you to
a hardware store (or if you bothered to read the whole file  first, you already
did) and you get some Muriatic Acid (this is HCl ie: hydrochloric acid) if they
ask why, tell them you have to clean yer concrete patio...  make sure its above
31.5% or thereabouts, or it just won't work right... If 31.5 seems a bit low...
think of this, HCl is a gas... and Hydrochloric Acid is a gas in a liquid... so
37% is deemed "Pure" or lab grade hydrochloric acid. Anyway...  I  digress.  So
put the acid in first (be careful...  they etch concrete with this stuff, think
of what it'll do  to yer piddies )  then when  ready, toss the aluminum in.  As
aforementioned, this will create Hydrogen, and hydrogen will ignite, so leave a
burning rag nearby.


     Because i'm in a really fucked up mood and really messed up the article
and don't want to rewrite it... here's a summary.

   1  6HCl(l) + 2Al(s) = 3H2(g) + 2AlCl3

   2  Al = aluminum (foil, shavings, can?)

   3  HCl = Hydrochloric Acid, or Muriatic acid (clean concrete with)

   4  Mixem together inna big bottle with a burning rag nearby

   5  Be  careful...  first time  around use a small bottle and a little bit of
            the Stuff...  and have a BB gun or a sling-shot handy to explode it
            if not enough force (NEVER PICK UP A FORCE GRENADE OR ANY EXPLOSIVE
            DEVICE THAT IS "SUPPOSED" TO BE EXPLODING)  Garbled had an accident
            which involved a mild baking soda bomb going  off in his hand... no
            serious damage.. fortunately it was a small plastic bottle.  But it
            still left his entire hand numb for an hour.

   IDIOT HACKING II
         The revenge of the fool killers!

         Rwho?  What?  Who?  Finger?  W?  Unix?  Telent?  Dialup?

Garbled User?

     Shaddup.  Yes,  It's me  again..  and again,  and again... this is getting
monotonus.  Well..  One more article for you..   After this  I'm done.. I swear
it! No REALLY!! This is it!, the end.. no more.. kaput..
Yeah.. right.. when aardvarks fly..


     OK.. ok.. enough nonsense..  Here we go with the ado..

    Say what?  You've just moved to a new NPA?  You're a new hacker?  You're on
vacation, and feel the need for unix speed?  NOT a problem..

     The trick  is of course.. quite simple.  First, find the local port dialup
for your area's  university,  corporation, etc.   Ok,  now  pull  out yor modem
set it at E71, and dial.  You  can't find  any  dialup  numbers??   ARGH!  Well
this is simple..  Pull  out a  fone book  and a  prefix  scanner.  Look  up the
local university, and see what it's numbers are.  Usually the U  will have  all
of it's numbers in a single  prefix.  Scan that  prefix  for  carriers.  If the
university has all different  prefixes, you could be in trouble. Scan around in
those areas.  Ex- University  of East BubbaFuck  Computer  Center 666-1313.  Ok
scan 666-1300 to 666-1399  Have fun.  The same method must   be used with large
corporations.  Mainly ones dealing in computers.

     Ok your in.. usually you will see some sort of strange login after hitting
return at least 500 times. Ex.
<300 CR's>
ACS PORT DIALUP
2400 QB13 tty666
Type ? for help.
Enter your destination
>

  Well great.. now what?  Duh.. If it offers help.. TAKE it!
>?
Enter one of the following areas
blackcube   asmodeusland   deathville   quadline
sunset      uebvm          lineuebvm    uebVAX
slownet     crisco

Or type one of these commands
help        hangup         showspeed    procecuteme

>

  Ok..   Now..   anything  that says  VM  should be immediately avoided.  Vm is
  quite possibly the worst  operating  system  ever invented. LineVM is equally
  as worthless.  In my opinon  VAX/VMS is  the the  best, but it is hell to get
  into.. SO if yer  new.. avoid  it.  Sunset  might be  a sunOS unix..  But you
  never  know.  SunOS  is FUN!  Blackcube  is obviously a NeXt, as are anything
  else with the words  black  or cube  in them.  Quadline  might be  a  dialout
  system,  or  one  of  those  horrid router  systems.   Slownet and crisco are
  routers ( which can be  fun..  but not very  often )  uebVAX is a VAX.. duh..
  The others,  asmodeusland  and deathville,  could be  anything..  most likely
  the main system for that university.. DEFINATELY try these out!

>asmodeusland
Portdialup calling ASMO QB13, tty9
SunOS UNIX 4.3.1 (asmodeusland)

login:

  Oh shit.. now what?  OK.. this is where the fun comes in! finger it out
  yourself!

login:finger
password:finger
Incorrect login
login:w

  jqbroin     13:25      telnet cube
  bolsdew     15:31      ls
  what        19:00      what
  operator    01:01      chuser bob

   YOU DID it!  Usually you have to go through about 4 years of this.. You have
   to   try  the   following  rwho  password  rwho,  who/who,  what/what,  w/w,
   finger/finger.   Most of  the time  it won't  ask for  a password.  Now just
   idiot hack these beautiful  accounts  you saw  above!   jqbroin.. try broin,
   jq, jqbroin,jbroin,qbroin..and anything else you can think of!
   The what is you for your information.

    OK,  you've got an account after many hours of using who accounts and idiot
  hacking.  Now  what?   Well  find  out  what  sort  of access you have!  Look
  around your directory a bit.  But there are THREE things you ALLWAYS do first
  when you enter a new account!!  #1, look at the last login date that shows up
  right before the system announcements.  If it is recent.. forget it.  Use the
  account to do some real  idiot hacking  ( See FBI 0001,  Idiot Hacking ).  If
  the date is nice and ancient..  Have fun.  #2 type "history" read the last 40
  commands.  If  the  guy  has  been  doing  all  sorts  of super - complicated
  programming and the such.  Forget it.  You'll die  real  fast..   If  the guy
  sends out 400 mail  messages a day,  forget it.  You'll be found out to fast.
  If all  he does  is login,  check his  mail and logout.. or something equally
  stupid..  take it from the fool.  What sort of  idiot has a password the same
  as his login name  anyways!?  #3,  check out if he  has a ton of mail.. If so
  find a new one.  Type  finger XXXXX where XXXX is your account name.. If it's
  a professor or something... well.. it's up to you.. but be careful.

        Ok, now try to send mail somewhere (us!) outside your local area.  Wait
  about  10 seconds,  and check your mail.. if there is a reply from the mailer
  daemon.. You have a shit system. ( no mail!! )  Now type  rn,  Rnews,  Pnwes,
  Inews.. see what you can get  into.  Try listing your  directory..  See  what
  sort of neeto toys are there for you to play with.

           Well... I hope you have fun with your new accounts!  Remember to try
     as  many  areas on  your dialup  that you  possibly can!  Enjoy your dayz!

    BTW- FBI is looking for Port Dialup numbers and adresses for a future list.
PLEASE  send us  the number  of your  local dialup!   WE NEED DIALUPS!  Even if
you only have the name, number..  whatever..  just send  it to us.. ( with area
code)  Thank you..

    What to do with ROOT@UNIX
   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-    ________________ 
                                 /BY: GaRblEd uSeR\
                                /==================\

     Hullo.  Just another  ARTICLE  on my favorite  oxymoron  and yours!!  UNIX
security!  OH yeah.  This one covers what to do ONCE you HAVE  root, not how to
get root.  So don't expect any magical formula here.

     Ok,  you've logged onto your fave  system with root.  Now, the first thing
you will want to do is secure things for  yourself.  Do this at about midnight.
That is generally a good time to hack.   You log in as root, look around.  Who,
what, ps, etc.etc...  Make  sure the REAL  root isn't on.. or you could  be one
dead dude VERY fast.  Ok, your safe.. not to many users on the system, no other
sysadmin  accounts on, ( daemon, uucp, sysadmin, etc. ) You will want to secure
your session.  Write down the current root password  somewhere.  Now change the
password.  This will keep the real root from logging in while you are on.  MAKE
sure  you change it back before you log off, or you could be in  some deeeeeeep
shit.  Now, you will want to secure your place on this system.  Use the adduser
( or something to that effect ) to create  a few  bogus users.  Now  check  the
/etc/passwd file to be sure they are in there.  Make them seem real, follow the
guidelines on  your system for  making them.  Example- My system uses the first
letter of the first name,and the last name as the username. So my name would be
guser.  Follow  whatever  the  formula  is.  Use a  few real sounding  names, I
usually use Ralph Norwieg or Peter Franklin. (rnorwieg,pfrankli) As you can see
it would be very hard to tell these are actually hacked accounts.

     Next you  want to steal a  few junked  accounts.  Find a few accounts that
have never been used, or have only been used once or twice.  6 months since the
last  login  is a  good place for you to start.   You can  grab these  accounts
easily.  Read the  /ect/passwd file,  look  at one  of the  accounts  you  just
created.  Write down the password for that account, In it's ENCRYPTED form. Now
edit the passwd file  so that you replace the passwords of all the accounts you
want to take with the encrypted code you just wrote down.  Get it?  You will be
making all those accounts have the same passwd as the one you took the code off
of.  At your leisure enter  the accounts and change the passwd to what you want
it to be.

     Ok, you are now WELL established on that system.. the real root will never
get rid  of you.  But  what if  he does?   You have  to leave  some gates open!
Here's what you do.  Edit the /etc/hosts file, so that the only line in it is a
"+" That's right just a plus sign. Delete the rest.  This will allow you to log
in from any  other system  in the  internet.  This way  you can  telnet in from
anywhere in the world and hack away!

     Ok, now  activate the  finger login.  This will let you login with account
finger  and look around a bit.   Like finding  users to idiot  hack.  Add this:
/usr/sbin/in.rwho   to the end of  /etc/inetd/rc.inet
    This activates rwho. Which allows you to see who's on from a remote system.
/etc/inetd.conf     Just delete the comment symbol (a #) in front of the finger
command. IF I remember correctly, you also have to add this to your /etc/passwd
file.  If so just add "finger::"  that should do nicely.

    Now, while you have the chance, grab some user lists from around the world.
Hopefully  you have  with you a  nice  big  telnetable  hosts list.  I'll do an
example using trantor.ee.msstate.edu
rcp trantor.ee.msstate.edu:/etc/passwd /etc/trantor.passwd

This will execute a remote copy from the other system to you. Feel free to edit
this file as you please, and keep a copy for yourself. Now that you have edited
it to your liking (changing passwords) type the following.
rcp /etc/trantor.passwd trantor.ee.msstate.edu:/etc/passwd

  You have just placed your edited passwd file onto that system.  Logically one
could start a wave of system takeovers throught the US using this method. But I
HIGHLY  advise against this,  because it may lead to the loss of my beloved rcp
command.  Also, this works on most systems.. but be warned, there is probably a
system out there somewhere where it does not.  So don't yell at me if you can't
edit the passwd file on your  fave site.  Mainly  you should use  the  file for
idiot hacking purposes ONLY.  But this sure is easier.. and by that  same note,
MUCH more dangerous, you could end up  stealing an  intelligent user's  account
somewhere.. which is ALLWAYS a  bad move.  Smart users  complain when they lose
their accounts.

    Well, thats all I have for you this month.. Enjoy.  Maybe next month I will
think  of some more lunatic  things to do to those poor defenceless UNIXes  out
there..  See you on the USENET!

       Garbled User of the FBI presents.....

  How to play the NAME GAME.
          or        Surviving in an underground world.

      Ever since the beginning of time, there has been much confusion as to the
 correct  name,  or  class to  call  certain  people in  the underground.  I am
 attempting to bring you the most complete list possible.  With this, hopefully
 we can clear up some misconceptions.

Hacker
        A hacker is generally accepted as being a person who uses his knowledge
 of  computers,  operating  systems,  and  software  to  break into  computers.
 Generally a hacker tries to get into a  system he does  not have  access  too,
 and learn as much about  it as possible,  without getting caught, or  damaging
 any data.
Ex-
   "I think a hacker broke into our system last night, there seems to be 1 hour
  of billing left unaccounted for."

Pirate
        A pirate is a person who copies, and trades programs and games that are
    under copyright.  This is generally done over Pirate BBS systems, which are
    located world-wide.
Ex-
   " Sierra has lost  over $45,000 in the past year due to pirates coping their
 games"

Trasher
       A trasher is a person who goes out late at night and searches trash bins
of his local companies for valuable information. Such information may be credit
card numbers, or local phone anomalies and codes.
Ex-
   "We've caught a trasher in our garbage bin last night, and we are attempting
 to prosecute him for trespassing."

Crasher
        This is a person who logs on to a system and causes it to crash, making
 it unavailable until the sysop gets on and reboots the computer.  These people
 can  also access  the databases,  and files  of the  system,  making all of it
 available to himself
Ex-
   "Some crasher crashed the system last week, and due to my vacation I was not
 able  to  correct the  problem until  now.   I apologize for  the system being
 unavailable for the past 6 days." 

Cracker
         A cracker is a form of a pirate who breaks the copy protection schemes
  on  software they  intend to pirate. These people are generally knowledgeable
 about programming, and many know ASM very well.
Ex-
  "We have got to get a cracker to break this program! It's useless without the
 dox!"

Anarchist
       This is a very general term, applied mainly to the person who engages in
 anarchy practices.  This person will generally blow up a bomb in the middle of
 nowhere for  fun, but  causes little  or no damage.  These  people can also be
 looked at as people who  hate law  in all  forms, and  go out  of their way to
 disobey it, or cause trouble.
Ex-
   " Did you  hear that  explosion last night?!  It must have been one of those
 anarchists!"

Militant
     This is a form of anarchist, whose main intent is to cause harm or damage.
These people should not be confused with a terrorist.  Their main cause is that
of  hatred, and a general dislike for humankind.  They have been known to throw
large bombs  into parade crowds,  or rallies.  They  are  VERY  dangerous,  and
usually phychopathic.
Ex-
   "Did you hear about the militant who took out K-Mart with an uzi last week?"

Computer Militant
        This  is a  person who  logs on  to a bbs,  or mainfraim  with the sole
 intention of destroying it, and all it's data.  These  people have  tremendous
 knowledge in the workings of a computer, but are  generally less knowledgeable
 than a  hacker.  Many  times  these people  are nothing  more than disgruntled
 workers,  or  ex-workers  who  are  enacting  their  revenge  on  the company.
Ex-
   "A  computer militant  formatted our hard-drive last night, causing the loss
 of all our data."

Phreaker
        This  is a person who is very much like a hacker.  Instead of attacking
 and  learning about computers, he uses the phone lines as a toy.  These people
 are generally equal to,  or superior  to most of the  phone  company itself in
 knowledge of the workings  of a telephone service.  Many of  these people have
 the  power  to do  things nearly  unimaginable to you and me.  Oftentimes they
 can call  long  distance  for  long  periods  of time,  and never  pay a cent.
Ex-
   "Some  phreaker ran up a $20,000 fone bill last month!  And he put it on the
 bill of some local company."

Rodent
        This is  an annoying person.  Generally a wanna be hacker.  He attempts
 to appear knowledgeable by reading  every file  he can  get his  hands on, and
 then bragging about  things that never  happened, or  minuscule hacks.   He is
 generally regarded as a nuisance and a fool.
Ex-
   "That damn  rodent keeps calling  me and  telling me how he broke into a C64
 BBS. What an idiot.. a dead mouse could break into a C64.."

Code Kidz
        This is one of  the most  hated people  in  the  phreaker  world.  This
   is a  person who  acquires codes to make long  distance calls,  and does not
   give  anything in  return.   He then  proceeds to give  the code  to all his
   friends,  and the  code dies shortly  thereafter.
Ex-
   "I wish you code  kidz would  leave something in return!  All you do is ruin
 our codes.. go bother some other area code!"

Abuser
        This is a form  of a code  kidz,  who takes a code and  uses it to it's
 fullest extent, running up bills of $5000+.  They also have been known to ruin
 a brand new code in less than 30 minutes.  These people are hated by phreakers
 and the phone company alike.  Neither  abusers or code kidz have any knowledge
 of the phone system.
Ex-
   "Abusers  have  ran  up  a bill  of over $50,000 to poor old Mrs. Fletcher."

Elf
        This is  the absolute  worst  form  of  a  rodent.   These  people  are
 complete computer geeks,  who spend  all of  their  time on  a computer.  They
 know very little  about ANYTHING  that  does not  deal  with  computers.  Most
 of their knowledge  is  completely useless  although.  Most of it dealing with
 PD software, and how to install a new  motherboard.   Many of  them  are wanna
 be hackers, but chicken  at the  thought of loosing their  computer equipment.
 They generally have  huge  egos,  and brag  about their  so-called-hacks.  The
 majority of  their information  is publicly  available,  making it  completely
 worthless.
Ex-
   "Look at all these computers! I'm in elven heaven!"


             Well, I hope my little file helped to inform you people out there.
    Hopefully the oddities and wars between us can stop. Except for the elves..
    kill them.

An Editorial On Windows, By GarblEd uSeR.

        Who Are YOU calling a LOW RANGE USER?

      In light of the recent  Microsoft/IBM  wars, it would seem that microsoft
likes to refer to us  DOS users as LOW  RANGE users.  Personally I find this to
be  quite an insult.  I have been using  dos since 2.0  came out,  and I use it
because it's  simple, and  effective.  I  am  simply more  at  home with a text
environment,  and  command line  parameters.  To the extent  that I find myself
spending more  time in a  GUI  environment trying to  load a program, then if I
could just type "CHKDSK" and leave it at that.  

        Personally, I have no hatred towards  Windows, or any of it's products.
Until now.  It seems  that windows is dominating the  market.  When I go to the
local software  store, too look at a new word processor I find interesting, the
first thing I see is, "Windows 3.0 Product."  Which to me, means, You can't use
this product, unless you shell out $99 bux for  windows.  Not a problem, I just
look for  the DOS version.  This used to work,  but now, companies are starting
to forget their  DOS users,  and are making  products for WINDOWS ONLY.  This I
find upsetting.  Such as  Borland's recent  aquirement of  Ashton Tate.  Rumors
are  now going  around that Borland  plans to  drop support  for the dos users,
which would leave NON-windows customers like me, and many others, searching the
market for a better program.

        This,  in itself  is upsetting  enough.  But reading  an article on the
Microsoft/IBM  war,  I see a small  quote by Bill  Gates. "We at microsoft have
taken control  of the  low-range(Dos)  and Medium  range(windows) environments,
while  IBM has taken  the High range(OS/2) environment."  Many of  you may look
at this and say, So what?!  But I do not.  He is  refering to those  of us, who
have  the intelligence, and cleverness to  use DOS, and saying we are LOW-range
users!  While windows users are concidered medium range.  

        This  makes little  or no  sence to  me.  How can  a user  who uses  an
environment  such as  windows,  where all  he does  is  use  easy-to-understand
mouse  clicks, and  neet little  graphics for  every  command,  be concidered a
HIGHER range than those of us who take the time to learn how to REALLY use dos.
Windows  was modeled  after the Macintosh,  which  was  originally  designed to
give the user an easy to learn environment.   This computer  line was  designed
for  the  computer  illiterate, and  is now being considered a better class  of
users than those of us  who actually have the  competance to  use command  line
programs?!

        Now, I understand that windows  has neet little features  such as being
able to  multi-task.  But the same thing  can be done in an environment such as
DesqView.  I am  sure  that there are many  other users who dislike this simple
approach to user  interfaces.  I  find it  utterly disgusting that my once high
and mighty DOS  machine, is being moved into the land of the MACS.  If I wanted
a Macintosh, I would have bought one.

        Should this  trend continue,  and dos-level  programs become a thing of
the past,  I will not  hesitate to  drop my Dos  in the garbage,  and pick up a
nice, cryptic copy of UNIX, or XENIX.  So  my words of wisdom to  you corporate
america, Forget not  your "low-range" users,  or they will forget you, and move
on to a different line of operating systems, and companies.

  This is just  my  personal opinion.  It may, or may not be the opinion of the
members of FBI.  But it is  mine, and  I intend  to express it, and live by it.
If you have an opposing  opinion, concerning this,  or any other topic, send it
to me.  If I get some letters of opinion, I will  not hesitate to print them in
a Letters To the Editors forum.

 NOVEL DECLARES WAR ON PIRATES!               BY: Garbled User

     Novell Inc. has incresed it's efforts to reduce piracy.  Recently busting
two BBSes for distributing copies of Novell NetWare 386 3.1.1, A program
costing up to $10,000.  Both of the BBSes were run in the california area.
The Red October BBS in Walnut Creek run by Captain Ramius had ALL of the
equipment for running the bbs taken away by the Novell agents with some help
from federal marshals.  The other BBS was The Original Wishlist in Redondo
beach.  A civil suit has been filed against Captain Ramius.  This could mean
up to $100,000 in fines.  But luckily he WON'T be going to jail.
 We're all behind you Captain!

     In another report from the Software Publishers Association, a group that
helps to lead the war on piracy, has stated that losses due to piracy have
dropped.  In 1989 an estimated 2.5 billion was lost to pirates, in 1990
only 2.4 billion.  Gee guys, yer slaking off! Get with it..
