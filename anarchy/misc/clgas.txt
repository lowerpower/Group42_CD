Chlorine gas is an extremely deadly gas which is EASY to make in your home.
There's a catch here: DON'T make it in your home. YOU WILL DIE. Make it
wherever you want to cause mayhem and sickness. 

Materials:
	One large jar
	One small bottle
	1:1 ratio (by volume) of:
		Household Ammonia
		CHLORINE bleach (not chlorine free)

	Now, from here it's easy. Put the bleach in the bottle and the 
ammonia in the jar. Or the other way around. It doesn't matter. Anyway, 
cap both containers and take them to your target area. This really can't 
be done "quickly", so if you want fast destruction, use something else.
	Now, find an obscure area to put the thing, and open both con-
tainers. Pour the contents from the bottle into the jar. Just make sure
your jar doesn't overflow. When this is complete, LEAVE! If you don't,
you will be overcome by the chlorine too, and probably die.

Note: If you can get a purer supply of ammonia, USE IT. Household is not
really that pure, but it's the best most people can do. If I remember
right, household ammonia only has about 30% active ammonia. Also, you
cannot use Mr. Clean or something. It has to be household cleaning ammonia.
This can be bought at any drug store, or grocery market.

----Synapsis----  I don't know the EXACT chemical reaction that occurs,
but the ammonia and the bleach bond to form CL gas. Anyone who breathes
this gas will either get very sick, and require hospitalization, or they
will die.

Enjoy!
