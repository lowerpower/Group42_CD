   This is a real quickie: How to de-childproof lighters. Almost all lighters
available now in the country (or at least my state), are "child-proof",
which is pretty stupid, cause the childproofing is a seperate little thing
you have to depress or slide around beforre striking, and little kids are
so good with their hands, I doubt the new system makes it that hard for kids
to light them. Anyway, I smoke cigars, and I know quite a few people that
smoke cigs and the like, and the best way to de-proof these new lighters
is to grab the little thing you have to pull or push or move with some
needle-nose pliers, and give it a good yank. Yup, just break it off. That'll
do it. Now it's just like an "old" lighter. 
	Note: This is only good for BIC lighters, I haven't figured out any
	other lighters.
