<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Captain Hack's Phreaking and Anarchy Info Files</H1> 
<hr size=1>
You may wonder what all these files are. Or you may never read this intro. 
I don't really know. Anyway, I'm formulating this collection to maintain 
freedom of the press in the 90's. The computer is the future's way of 
"The Press", and I think there should be <B>NO</B> ban on what kind of 
information is passed over boards etc. I'm making this collection just so 
it'll be that much harder for the Feds to get all of the H/P/A/V/C files 
out of circulation, <B>SHOULD</B> they ever ban them.<P>

This collection begins in 1995. I don't know when it will end. Hopefully, 
there will be several hundred files written or revised by me by the time 
I stop writing these. I am not releasing all of these files at once, I am 
putting them out as I complete them, so check your local boards for new 
ones often. I may not put out one a week...but perhaps 2 or 3 a month. Think 
of this collection as a bi-weekly underground newsletter. Just shorter.<P>

However you think of it, just remember that it's not the destruction that 
counts. It's our right to information, and the US government cannot and shall 
not take that right from us. I charge you, the reader, with this responsability: 
You must not, under any circumstances, allow the Feds to ban and remove all 
hack and phreak files. There is a heritage to them, they've been written for 
a decade before I knew what a floppy disk was, and with your help, they will 
continue to be written for a decade after.<P>

All I will say is this: I, Captain Hack, will not take any responsibility for 
any actions by anyone on the advice of these files. If you choose to utilize 
these files, and follow the instructions in them, that is <B>YOUR</B> choice, 
and I cannot be held responsible for your actions. Some of the actions or 
products discussed in the files can <B>SERIOUSLY INJUR OR KILL YOU</B>. Please 
take all precautions before participating in any procedure described within 
these articles.<P>

Just covering my ass. You understand.<P>
