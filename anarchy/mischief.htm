<h3>Elementry Anarchy and other Various Mischeif</h3>
by:<p>                  -[ The Epidemic ]-<p>-  SCHOOL MISCHEIF:<p>   a. tv mischeif:<p>                  Most schools have tv's in all of the classrooms hooked up to the walls or something. Check out what kinda tv your school has. For instance, mine has all magnavox tv's.  Go home and snag a remote from your house, friend, neighbor, whoever. Make sur
e the remote is made by the same company that makes your school's tv's. Bring that remote into your classes. The next thing you do is up to you. You could randomly flip the tv on and off the whole class, but this doesn't work for long cuz usually the teacher has a fit and unplugs it. You could also turn the tv on and quickly mute it. Then you could flip channels and get to your favorite show. Instead of hearing about the missouri comprimise, you could see what great bargains the home shopping network has. O
f course you'd have to reap lips, plus the whole class would crack up, so its a good idea not to tip off anyone but yer friends that you have the remote.<p>   b. computer mischeif:<p>        Yer school must have some computers, right? Of course! The hardest part you have is to get into the finder, or on an ibm, to get to dos (but we'll say finder, just so i don't have to explain it in different versions). You could ask your librarian, or whever runs the place where your target computer is located, to pu
t you in finder becasue you have to do a project or something, or you need to get some file for your own computer (think of something creative). If they don't let you then get DisEase or something and get the p/w.  If you can't do either of those, you'll have to guess it. Try first names, last names, birthdays, relative's names (wife, child) or any of those backwards.  Whatever. So once you get in to the finder go into a folder that they won't hardly ever look in. For instance, my library teacher is scared 
to death of going into the system folder. She thinks that the computer will, like, explode or something if you go in there. So go into a folder like that and create a folder called something that sounds technical like "modifications" or "formula text converting". Then, when you have a folder like that slap a program that records keystrokes, like for instance, Keystroke, in the extensions folder. You have an option of making it invisible using resedit [explained later] or not. Then restart, and move the log 
into the new folder. You will not only pick up the at ease password, but network passwords, text written about the school, maybe grades, and various other things people care to type. My friend [me, bungalow bill] picked up a user and a system password for this kid who sysops a board and calls it from school. It's best when you get fun stuff like that. This also works best when you have a librarian who's computer illiterate. Also, you could try this one on computers your parent's work might have or any offic
e place at all. Its always good to have passwords to big companies like that. Have fun with this one and use your imagination.<p>-  FILE HIDING:<p>   a.  invisibility:<p>        Do you have those certain files that you just want to keep hidden from people? Oh, say, those anarchy files you downloaded the other day. Mom and dad would hit the roof if they saw that you were trying to construct a bomb.  Or maybe you hid keystroke somewhere in the school computer. Well, do you have resedit? You'd better. O
pen it up and a little box will appear asking what you want to edit. Hit cancel. The box will close and your options will lie at the menu bar at the top of the screen. Go to "file" and select "get file/folder info." A box will appear on the screen. Here you should select which file or folder you want invisible. Then a little diologue box will pop up. It has various check boxes. Check "invisible". Viola! Your file can not be found when you go back and look for it, yet it is still there, running. You also can
not find it when you hit "find".  The only way you can find it is in a "search all files" type command, such as in Microsoft word.<p>     b.  visibility:<p>        Now that you have your hidden file, no one will get it. But you think, "hey i want to run that file!" But its invisible. You can not run these programs when they are invisible (unless they start up by themselves, like Keystroke). All you have to do to make your file reappear is to do all the same things you did to make it invisible. When you 
get to the last diolouge box make it so that the "invisible" option is not checked. Your file will reappear.<p>-  PAY PHONE MISCHEIF:<p>  a.  the paper clip method:<p>        Gotta make a phone call at a payphone but you have no change? Well, you could always use that red box that you own, but that would only work for a long distance call. Why not just try a paper clip? On some of the payphones that I've encountered you can get free phone calls using a straightened paper clip. First pick up the phone
. You will see a bunch of tiny holes formed in a circle on the mouth peice. Stick one end of the unbent paper clip in the circle that's in the very middle. Then look at the actual body of the phone. Somewhere you will see another little hole. NYNEX phones have two, use the one nearer the top. Stick the other end in it. Then dial. Wait until it starts ringing, then remove the clip. If someone picks up while the clip is still in, the microphone will be zapped, and you may get a slight shock. You'll know if it
 works or not on the type of pay phone that you're using if someone picks up on the number you're dialing. If this method doesn't work then you can go ahead and use your red box that you own, and if you don't have that, then I guess you're gonna have to use a quarter. Ah well.<p>-  GAS GRILL MISCHEIF:<p>  a.  ignition:<p>        You know that gas grill you own? Do you want to see a huge kickin' flame shoot out the top? Of course you do, and this is how you do it. First turn on the gas. Next turn both
 the oven handles to the highest setting (ie, HIGH). Wait something like ten seconds. Then throw a match into it. BOOM.  I've done this various times and never gotten burned, but i'd advise you to take precautions. Just don't burn yourself. You get a nice neat little burn on yer face plus you look like a friggin' idiot. Also, you can scare little kids and adults with this. Just don't take it too far.<p>+^+^+^+^+^+^+^+^+^+^^Brought to you by:++^+^+^+^+^+^+^+^+^+^<p>the epidemic: Omega BBS
