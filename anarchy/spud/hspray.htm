You may want a couple of buddies to go in buying the material with
you, or make 3 at the same time, as the pipe comes in 10 foot chunks.
I bought all material at a local "Home Depot" for about $15.
</P><P>
Note on choice of material:
I have seen and heard of plans for spud guns using PVC pipe.
In fact, an article in the February issue of "Modern Gun" uses PVC.
I chose to use schedule 40 ABS plastic.  The black pipe usually used
for sewerage.  If you want to know why I chose ABS, take a chunk of
PVC pipe.  Hit it with a 25 lb sledge hammer.  It fragments into
many *sharp* pieces.  Try this with ABS.  The sledge hammer bounces
off the pipe and smashes into your foot.  But it didn't break!
(The pipe, that is, I don't know about your foot).  PVC also gets
brittle with exposure to sunlight.  ABS just gets
hot.  Only ever use schedule 40!  That's the thick stuff.
It costs a little more, but not that much more.
The bill of material says 10 foot lengths, only because that's as
small a piece as is normally sold.

        They are normally made for putting inside a Colman
        lantern or stove so you don't need matches.

<H3 ALIGN=center>Construction</H3>
<P>
Step 1 - Cut the combustion chamber to size.  Cut off a 14 inch
         section of the 3 inch diameter pipe.  You don't need
         the rest of the 10 foot length, so save it for future
         bazookas, or make one with a
         couple of buddies splitting the cost.
</P><P>
Step 2 - glue the 3inch to 2 inch bushing into one side of
         the 3 inch coupling, glue the other side of the
         coupling to one end of the 14 inch combustion chamber.
         Make sure the joints are clean first
         and be liberal with the glue.
</P><P>
Step 3 - glue the threaded coupling to the other end of the
         combustion chamber (using the slip-joint side,
         obviously)  make sure the glue doesn't run into
         the threads.
</P><P>
Step 4 - Cut the "barrel" to size.  Cut off a 36 inch
         (3 foot) length of the 2 inch pipe.  Glue this into
         the other end of the bushing you've
         glued to the combustion chamber.  You should now
         have the complete gun, but it's not ready for firing
         just yet.
</P><P>
Step 5 - Using a file, taper the "muzzle" for the last half
         an inch on the outside.  This will serve to cut the
         potato as it's rammed in.
</P><P>
Step 6 - You'll need to mount the sparker inside the end cap.
         If you got the Coleman one, it is threaded and has
         two nuts with it.  There is also an angled piece of
         metal meant to hold the ignitor inside a lantern.
         Take the knurled knob off the end of the shaft.
         Be careful - there's an extra flint inside the knob.
         Unscrew the nut and discard the angled bit of metal.
         Drill a hole dead center in the ABS end cap of a diameter
         to take the shaft of the ignitor.  Mount the ignitor
         inside the end cap, put the nut on the outside of the
         shaft and tighten until the ignitor is held in place.
         The shaft will slide back and forth, but won't come out.
         Put the end knob back on and tighten the lock screw.
</P><P>
Step 7 - Make sure the glue has "cured".  I left mine overnight
         before firing.
</P><P>
Step 8 - make a ram rod.  I used surplus 1/2 inch PVC pipe,
         4 feet in length.  A broomhandle, etc. will do.
         Measure and make a mark about 2 feet 8 inches down
         the ram rod.
</P><P>
To fire:
remove end cap.
Ram a potato from the muzzle end.  The tapered end will cut the
potato to size. Make sure it has a good seal as you ram it down
with the ramrod.  Ram to the mark you made.  I've found most
misfires happen when there are gaps between the potato and the
barrel where gasses can escape.   Spray 2 - 5 seconds worth of
cheap hair spray (white rain, aqua net)   I'd use an "unscented"
one if you can, or the gun stinks after a few shots!   Start at
2 seconds and build up!
After the hair spray, quickly screw in the end cap.
One twist of the ignitor knob sends the spud skyward!
</P><P>
<H3 ALIGN=center>Safety</H3>
Once you shoot this, you'll see the potato comes out with enough
force, you wouldn't want to be on the wrong side!  Usual safety
about pointing the muzzle etc. still apply.
This is for fun only.  I don't make any guarantee you won't
blow your arse off.  (You may laugh it off, however).  Personally,
I'd never use acetylene, starting fluid (ether), black powder,
lighter fluid, gasoline etc. as a propellant, but
you may not value your body parts as much <g>.
</P><P>
You can get 3 shots off a big spud.  Partially baked ones are
fun - they seal in better and shoot farther, but they do break
up and the barrel is a mess to clean up afterwards.
</P><P>
<H3 ALIGN=center>Clean up</H3>Soap and water.  Push a small towel through (here's a case where it's OK to clean from the muzzle).
I've been shooting mine since 12/94 and have been having a
barrel of laughs.  The spuds will go nearly 200 yards!
I plan to make the "220 swift" variety by coupling a one inch
barrel to the three inch combustion chamber.
I wonder if you put the barrels on threaded couplings you could have
interchangeable barrels.  Sort of an "Idaho Contender".
</P><P>
<H3 ALIGN=center>Other tricks</H3> Ram in a cardboard container from McDonalds from
an order of large fries.  Leave the fries in the container.
The cardboard serves as a sabot and voila - a shotgun!
