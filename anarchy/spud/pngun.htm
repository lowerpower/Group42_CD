<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PURPOSE</H3>

Ever seen those silly little hairspray powered spud guns that
are all the rage?  How'd you like to show up those guys with a
cannon capable of launching spuds nearly 5 times farther?  Read
on...
<P>

Testing of hairspray spud guns revealed they can develop no more
than 10-20 PSI chamber pressure.  Most are built from schedule
40 PVC pipe.  3" PVC pipe has a burst pressure of 260 PSI. 
People have suggested using other fuels to boost pressures
higher, however this is much to dangerous.  More volatile fuels
can be very unpredictable and create pressures that would
shatter the PVC pipe.  Compressed air can be regulated to exact
safe pressures making it an excellent propellant.  The trick is
releasing a large volume of air at once to launch the
projectile.  Here's how it's done...</P>

<H3 ALIGN=center>ASSEMBLY</H3>
<P>

Cut the pipes to length.  The barrel pipe must have a perfectly
square and smooth surface on the breach end.  You may have to
flat file and sand it to make sure a good seal with the
diaphragm is achieved.
</P><P>
Cut a 3 3/16 diameter disk of 3/32 thick polypropylene or
polyethylene.  A cheap dishpan from Kmart may be a good source
of diaphragm material.
</P><P>
The front bell reducer has a small ridge that would prevent
barrel from being pushed through it during assembly.  Use a half
round file to remove the ridge.  Make sure you can push the
barrel though the reducer.  Remove the barrel and set it aside.
</P><P>
Drill a hole through the center of the cleanout plug.  Size this
hole to achieve a tight fit with the tapered nozzle of the blow
gun.
</P><P>
Assemble the outer chamber first.  Glue the bell reducer and the
female adapter to each end of the 3" pipe.  allow the glue to
dry before proceeding to install the barrel.
</P><P>
Place the diaphragm in the female adapter and screw the cleanout
plug in firmly.  Push the barrel through the reducer until it
sets firmly against the diaphragm.  Pull it back out 3 inches to
allow glue to be applied.  Apply glue to the barrel in front of
the reducer and push it quickly back into position against the
diaphragm.  Hold the barrel in place until the glue dries.
</P><P>
After the gun is assembled, remove the cleanout plug and check
to see if the barrel is properly centered in the female adapter
at the breach.  If it is not, cut 3 or 4 pieces of 5/8" heater
hose about 1" long  and force them between the barrel and the
outer chamber.
</P><P>
Slip the old trouser legs over the chamber area of the cannon
and tape them in place.  This simple precaution will contain any
pieces of exploding pipe from becoming shrapnel if something
should go wrong.
</P><P>
<H3 ALIGN=center>FIRING</H3>

To fire the cannon, unscrew the cleanout plug and remove the
diaphragm.  Push a pre-cut spud into the breach of the barrel,
making sure it is an inch or two below flush.  Replace the
diaphragm and screw the cleanout plug in firmly.  Point the
cannon down range.  Place the blowgun in the charging hole
drilled centered in the cleanout plug.  Start squirting air into
the cannon with the blowgun.  When the sound of hissing air
quiets down or stops, the cannon is charged and ready to fire. 
Keep the blowgun valve pressed down.  Aim carefully and pull the
blowgun from the charging hole.

<H3 ALIGN=center>TIPS</H3>

A tapered nozzle on the blowgun is a must.  Size the hole in the
cleanout plug to fit the nozzle snugly.   Sharpen a short piece
of 1 1/2 pipe on the outside to precut your potato.  
Portability can be had with a 5 or 10 Lb. bottle of CO2 and a
regulator.   feel free to experiment with different barrel and
chamber lengths.  This plan was only a starting point.   Get a
couple of friends to help spot your shots.  The spud leaves the
barrel *REAL* fast and can be hard to see.  I've got one shot to
go 755 yards!
</P><P>
<H3 ALIGN=center>THEORY</H3>

Because the diaphragm is somewhat flexible it will bend it's
outer edges forward from the pressure and allow the air to fill
the outer chamber.  At the same time this forward pressure is
sealing off the end of the barrel preventing air from escaping up the
barrel.  Pulling the blowgun out of the charging hole allows the
air behind the diaphragm to escape to the atmosphere.  At this
point all the pressure stored in the outer chamber bends the
diaphragm in the opposite direction sealing off on the outer
edge of the cleanout plug.  The diaphragm continues to bend
under the pressure and unseals the barrel end allowing the
stored air to escape up the barrel behind the spud.  This in
turn, propels the potato distances before unknown to mortal spud
marksmen.  
</P><P>
In the pneumatics industry, this device is called a quick
exhaust valve.   It's commonly used on truck air brakes.  In an
emergency, the quick exhaust valve dumps air from the spring
brake chambers to apply the brakes fast.
</P><P>
<H3 ALIGN=center>SAFETY</H3>

DO NOT FIRE THE CANNON AT ANYONE OR ANYTHING.  At nearly 500
feet per second muzzle velocity, a potato would be lethal if it
were to hit someone.
</P><P>
The pipe should be clearly marked SCH-40 260 PSI.  ACCEPT NO
SUBSTITUTIONS or you will be reinventing the pneumatic hand
grenade.
</P><P>

When assembling the gun BE SURE TO USE THE PROPER TYPE OF PIPE
CEMENT!  Do not use cement made for ABS pipe.   If you have any
doubts about your gluing technique, GET PLUMBER TO HELP YOU!
</P><P>
USE ONLY 100 PSI MAX!  This gives the plastic pipe a safety
factor of  more than 2.
</P><P>
KEEP THE CANNON AT ROOM TEMPERATURE!  Exposure to cold
temperatures can cause the pipe to become dangerously brittle.
</P><P>
As pipe ages it may be a good idea to build a new cannon and
discard your old one.  All plastics have a limited life span and
it would be very difficult to estimate the safe life of the
cannon.  ALWAYS KEEP THE TROUSER LEGS IN PLACE ON THE CHAMBER
WHEN FIRING! 
</P><P>
BE CAREFUL and have fun!
