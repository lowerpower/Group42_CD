 --- ---------- ----- --- 
*I recomend that you do this local*

To make a conference call with as many
people you want, just call the operator
("0") and say "Hello, I'd like to make a
conference call." Then give the (first) 
Names (not pirate names, ether) and the
phone #'s of the people you want to call
And she'll do it.(hint: make sure that the
people you are callin are expecting it.
because its damn annoying to be talking to
3 people and having the third be busy for the
whole time

  -=] Charge-a-call phones [=-
  --- ------------- ------ ---

On a charge-a-call phone (there blue but
dont have any coin slots) take a hex wrench
(with a hole in the middle) and remove the
screw in the middle for an extention!
----- -- --- ------ --- -- ----------

  -=] Free calls [=-
  --- ---- ----- ---

From a pay phone, (the kind that gives yo
a dial tone AFTER you put in the dime) and
drop in your dime.  Then dial the #, then
put another dime in!  It'll come back out 
when you finish your call.

Carbide Bomb
------------

     This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exer-
cise extreme caution....
     Obtain some calcium carbide. This
is the stuff that is used in carbide
lamps and can be found at nearly any
hardware store. Take a few pieces of
this stuff (it looks like gravel) and
put it in a glass jar with some water.
Put a lid on tightly. The carbide will
react with the water to produce acedy-
lene carbonate which is similar to the
gas used in cutting torches. Eventually
the glass with explode from internal
pressure. If you leave a burning rag
nearby, you will get a nice fireball!


Portable Grenade Launcher
-------------------------

If you have a bow, this one is for you.
Remove the ferrule from an aluminum arrow, and
fill the arrow with black powder (I use grade FFFF,
it burns easy) and then glue a shotshell primer into
the hole left where the ferrule went.

Next, glue a BB on the primer, and you
are ready to go!

Make sure no one is nearby. Little shreds of aluminim
go everywhere.


Auto Exhaust Flame Thrower
--------------------------

     For this one, all you need is a 
car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a
switch. Install the spark plug into the
last four or five inches of the tailpipe
by drilling a hole that the plug can 
screw into easily. 
     Attach the wire (this is regular
insulated wire) to one side of the 
switch and to the spark plug. The other
side of the switch is attached to the 
positive terminal on the battery.
     With the car running, simply hit
the switch and watch the flames fly!!!
Again be careful that no one is behind
you! I have seen some of these flames
go 20 feet!!!
