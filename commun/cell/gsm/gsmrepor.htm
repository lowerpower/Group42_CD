<h2><a name="1">History of GSM</a></h2>

During the early 1980s, analog cellular telephone systems were experiencing 
rapid growth in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, 
but also in France and Germany.  Each country developed its own system, 
which was incompatible with everyone else's in equipment and operation.  
This was an undesirable situation, because not only was the mobile equipment 
limited to operation within national boundaries, which in a unified Europe 
were increasingly unimportant, but there was also a very limited
market for each type of equipment, so economies of scale and the subsequent
savings could not be realized.
<p>

The Europeans realized this early on, and in 1982 the Conference of European
Posts and Telegraphs (CEPT) formed a study group called the Groupe
Sp&eacute;cial Mobile (GSM) to study and develop a pan-European public land 
mobile system.  The proposed system had to meet certain criteria:
<ul>
<li> Good subjective speech quality
<li> Low terminal and service cost
<li> Support for international roaming
<li> Ability to support handheld terminals
<li> Support for range of new services and facilities
<li> Spectral efficiency
<li> ISDN compatibility
</ul>

In 1989, GSM responsibility was transferred to the European Telecommunication
Standards Institute (ETSI), and phase I of the GSM specifications were
published in 1990.  Commercial service was started in mid-1991, and by 1993
there were 36 GSM networks in 22 countries, with 25 additional countries
having already selected or considering GSM <a href="#bib">[6]</a>.  
Although standardized in Europe, GSM is not only a European
standard.  GSM networks are operational or planned in almost 60 countries in
Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Africa, South America, and Australia.
In the beginning of 1994, there were 1.3 million subscribers
worldwide <a href="#bib">[18]</a>.  By the beginning of 1995, there were over 5 million
subscribers <a href="#bib">[21]</a>.  The acronym GSM now aptly stands for Global System 
for Mobile communications.
<p>

The developers of GSM chose an unproven (at the time) digital system, as opposed
to the then-standard analog cellular systems like AMPS in the United States
and TACS in the United Kingdom.  They had faith that advancements in 
compression algorithms and digital signal processors would allow the
fulfillment of the original criteria and the continual improvement of the
system in terms of quality and cost.  The nearly 6000 pages of GSM recommendations
try to allow flexibility and competitive innovation among suppliers, but
provide enough standardization to guarantee the proper interworking between the
components of the system.  This is done by providing functional and interface
descriptions for each of the functional entities defined in
the system.

<h2><a name="2">Services provided by GSM</a></h2>

From the beginning, the planners of GSM wanted ISDN compatibility in
terms of the services offered and the control signalling used.  However,
radio transmission limitations, in terms of bandwidth and cost, do not allow the
standard ISDN B-channel bit rate of 64 kbps to be practically achieved.
<p>

Using the ITU-T definitions, telecommunication services can be divided 
into bearer services, teleservices, and supplementary services.
The most basic teleservice supported by GSM is telephony.  As with all
other communications, speech is
digitally encoded and transmitted through the GSM network as a digital
stream.  There is also an emergency service, where the nearest 
emergency-service provider
is notified by dialing three digits (similar to 911).  
<p>

A variety of data services is offered.  GSM users can send and receive data,
at rates up to 9600 bps, to users on POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service),
ISDN, Packet Switched Public
Data Networks, and Circuit Switched Public Data Networks using a
variety of access methods and protocols, such as X.25 or X.32.
Since GSM is a digital network, a modem is not required between the
user and GSM network, although an audio modem is required inside the
GSM network to interwork with POTS.
<p>

Other data services include Group 3 facsimile, as described in ITU-T 
recommendation T.30, which is supported
by use of an appropriate fax adaptor.  A unique feature of GSM, not found
in older analog systems, is the Short Message Service (SMS).  SMS is
a bidirectional service for short alphanumeric 
(up to 160 bytes) messages.  Messages are transported
in a store-and-forward fashion.  For point-to-point SMS, a message can
be sent to another subscriber to the service, and an acknowledgement of
receipt is provided to the sender.  SMS can also be used in a cell-broadcast
mode, for sending messages such as traffic updates or
news updates.  Messages can also be stored in the SIM card for later
retrieval <a href="#bib">[2]</a>.
<p>

Supplementary services are provided on top of teleservices or bearer
services.  In the current (Phase I) specifications, they include several
forms of call forward (such as call forwarding when the mobile subscriber is
unreachable by the network), and call barring of outgoing or incoming calls,
for example when roaming in another country.  Many additional supplementary
services will be provided in the Phase 2 specifications, such as caller 
identification, call waiting, multi-party conversations.

<h2><a name="3">Architecture of the GSM network</h2>

A GSM network is composed of several functional entities, whose functions
and interfaces are specified.  Figure 1 shows the layout of a generic GSM
network.  The GSM network can be divided into three broad parts.  The
Mobile Station is carried by the subscriber, the Base Station Subsystem
controls the radio link with the Mobile Station.  The
Network Subsystem, the main part of which is the Mobile services
Switching Center, performs the switching of calls between the
mobile and other fixed or mobile network users, as well as
mobility management.  Not shown
is the Operations and Maintenance Center, which oversees the
proper operation and setup of the network.  The Mobile Station
and the Base Station Subsystem communicate across the Um interface,
also known as the air interface or radio link.  The Base Station
Subsystem communicates with the Mobile services Switching Center 
across the A interface.
<p>

<img src="tarch.gif">
<h5>Figure 1.  General architecture of a GSM network</h5>
<p>

<h3><a name="3.1">Mobile Station</a></h3>

The mobile station (MS) consists of the mobile equipment (the terminal)
and a smart 
card called the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM).  The SIM provides
personal mobility, so that the user can have access to subscribed
services irrespective of 
a specific terminal.  By inserting the SIM card into another GSM terminal, 
the user is able to receive calls at that terminal, make calls
from that terminal, and receive other subscribed services.
<p>

The mobile equipment is uniquely identified by the International Mobile
Equipment Identity (IMEI).  The SIM card contains the International
Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) used to identify the subscriber to the system,
a secret key for authentication, and other information.  The IMEI and
the IMSI are independent, thereby allowing personal mobility.  The SIM
card may be protected against unauthorized use 
by a password or personal identity number.

<h3><a name="3.2">Base Station Subsystem</a></h3>

The Base Station Subsystem is composed of two parts, the Base Transceiver
Station (BTS) and the Base Station Controller (BSC).  These communicate
across the standardized Abis interface, allowing (as in the rest of the
system) operation between components made by different suppliers.
<p>

The Base Transceiver Station houses the radio tranceivers that define
a cell and handles the radio-link protocols with the Mobile Station.
In a large urban area, there will potentially be a large number of
BTSs deployed, thus the requirements for a BTS are ruggedness, reliability,
portability, and minimum cost.
<p>

The Base Station Controller manages the radio resources for one or more
BTSs.  It handles radio-channel setup, frequency hopping, and handovers,
as described below.  The BSC is the connection between the mobile station and
the Mobile service Switching Center (MSC).

<h3><a name="3.3">Network Subsystem</a></h3>

The central component of the Network Subsystem is the Mobile services
Switching Center (MSC).  It acts like a normal switching node of the
PSTN or ISDN, and additionally provides all the functionality needed
to handle a mobile subscriber, such as registration, authentication,
location updating, handovers, and call routing to a roaming subscriber.
These services are provided in conjuction with several functional
entities, which together form the Network Subsystem.  The MSC
provides the connection to the fixed networks (such as the PSTN or ISDN).
Signalling between functional entities in the Network Subsystem uses 
Signalling System
Number 7 (SS7), used for trunk signalling in ISDN 
and widely used in current public networks.
<p>

The Home Location Register (HLR) and Visitor Location Register (VLR),
together with the MSC, provide the call-routing and 
roaming capabilities of GSM.  The HLR contains all
the administrative information of each subscriber registered in the
corresponding GSM network, along with the current location of the mobile.
The location of the mobile is typically in the form of the signalling
address of the VLR associated with the mobile station.  The actual
routing procedure will be described later.  There is logically 
one HLR per GSM network, although it may be implemented as a distributed
database.
<p>

The Visitor Location Register (VLR) contains selected administrative information
from the HLR, necessary for call control and provision of the subscribed
services, for each mobile currently located in the geographical area
controlled by the VLR.  Although each functional entity can be 
implemented as an independent unit, all manufacturers of switching
equipment to date implement the VLR together with the MSC, so that the 
geographical area controlled by the MSC corresponds to that controlled by the VLR,
thus simplifying the signalling required.  Note that the MSC contains no
information about particular mobile stations --- this information is
stored in the location registers.
<p>

The other two registers are used for authentication and security purposes.
The Equipment Identity Register (EIR) is a database that contains a list of
all valid mobile equipment on the network, where each mobile station
is identified by its International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI).  An
IMEI is marked as invalid if it has been reported stolen or is not
type approved.  The Authentication Center (AuC) is a protected database 
that stores a copy of the secret key stored in each subscriber's SIM card,
which is used for authentication and encryption over the radio channel.

<h2><a name="4">Radio link aspects</a></h2>

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which manages the 
international allocation of radio spectrum (among many other functions),
allocated the bands 890-915 MHz for the uplink (mobile station to base
station) and 935-960 MHz for the downlink (base station to mobile
station) for mobile networks in Europe.  Since this range was already
being used in the early 1980s by the analog systems of the day, 
the CEPT had the foresight
to reserve the top 10 MHz of each band for the GSM network that was
still being developed.  Eventually, GSM will be allocated the entire
2x25 MHz bandwidth.

<h3><a name="4.1">Multiple access and channel structure</a></h3>

Since radio spectrum is a limited resource shared by all users, a method
must be devised to divide up the bandwidth among as many users as possible.
The method chosen by GSM is a combination of Time- and Frequency-Division
Multiple Access (TDMA/FDMA).  The FDMA part involves the division by frequency
of the (maximum) 25 MHz bandwidth into 124 carrier frequencies spaced 200 kHz 
apart.
One or more carrier frequencies are assigned to each base station.
Each of these carrier frequencies is then divided in time, using a TDMA 
scheme.  The fundamental unit of time in this TDMA scheme is called a 
<em>burst period</em> and
it lasts 15/26 ms (or approx. 0.577 ms).  Eight burst periods are grouped into
a <em>TDMA frame</em> (120/26 ms, or approx. 4.615 ms), which forms the basic unit 
for the definition of
logical channels.  One physical channel is one burst period per TDMA frame.
<p>

Channels are defined by the number and position of their corresponding burst
periods.  All these definitions are cyclic, and the entire pattern repeats
approximately every 3 hours.  Channels can be divided into <em>dedicated
channels</em>, which are allocated to a mobile station, and <em>common 
channels</em>, which are used by mobile stations in idle mode.

<h4>Traffic channels</h4>

A traffic channel (TCH) is used to carry speech and data traffic.  Traffic
channels are defined using a 26-frame multiframe, or group of 26 TDMA frames.
The length of a 26-frame multiframe is 120 ms, which is how the length of
a burst period is defined (120 ms $\div$ 26 frames $\div$ 8 burst periods per 
frame).  Out of the 26 frames, 24 are used for traffic, 1 is used for the
Slow Associated Control Channel (SACCH) and 1 is currently unused (see
Figure 2).  TCHs
for the uplink and downlink are separated in time by 3 burst periods, so that
the mobile station does not have to transmit and receive simultaneously, thus
simplifying the electronics.
<p>

In addition to these <em>full-rate</em> TCHs, there are also
<em>half-rate</em> TCHs defined, although they are not yet
implemented.  Half-rate TCHs will effectively double the capacity of a system
once half-rate speech coders are specified (i.e., speech coding at around 7 kbps,
instead of 13 kbps).  Eighth-rate TCHs are also specified, and are used for
signalling.  In the recommendations, they are called Stand-alone 
Dedicated Control Channels (SDCCH).
<p>

<img src="ttch.gif">
<h5>Figure 2.  Organization of bursts, TDMA frames, and multiframes for
speech and data</h5>

<h4>Control channels</h4>

Common channels can be accessed both by idle mode and dedicated mode mobiles.
The common channels are used by idle mode mobiles to exchange the
signalling information required to change to dedicated mode.  Mobiles
already in dedicated mode monitor the
surrounding base stations for handover and other information. 
The common channels are defined within a 51-frame multiframe, so that
dedicated mobiles using the 26-frame multiframe TCH structure can still
monitor control channels.  The common channels include:
<dl>
<dt>Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH)
<dd>Continually broadcasts,
      on the downlink, information including base station identity,
      frequency allocations, and frequency-hopping sequences.
<dt>Frequency Correction Channel (FCCH) and Synchronisation Channel
      (SCH) 
<dd>Used to synchronise the mobile to the time slot structure of a
      cell by defining the boundaries of burst periods, and the time slot
      numbering.  Every cell in a GSM network broadcasts exactly one FCCH and 
      one SCH, which are by definition on time slot number 0 (within a 
      TDMA frame).
<dt>Random Access Channel (RACH) 
<dd>Slotted Aloha channel used by the
      mobile to request access to the network.
<dt>Paging Channel (PCH)
<dd>Used to alert the mobile station of
      incoming call.
<dt>Access Grant Channel (AGCH)
<dd>Used to allocate an SDCCH to
      a mobile for signalling (in order to obtain a dedicated channel),
      following a request on the RACH.
</dl>

<h4>Burst structure</h4>

There are four different types of bursts used for transmission in GSM 
<a href="#bib">[16]</a>.
The normal burst is used to carry data and most signalling.  It has a total
length of 156.25 bits, made up of two 57 bit information bits, a 26 bit
training sequence used for equalization, 1 stealing bit for each information
block (used for FACCH), 3 tail bits at each end, and an 8.25 bit guard
sequence, as shown in Figure 2.  The 156.25 bits are transmitted in
0.577 ms, giving a gross bit rate of 270.833 kbps.
<p>

The F burst, used on the FCCH, and the S burst, used on the SCH, have the
same length as a normal burst, but a different internal structure, which
differentiates them from normal bursts (thus allowing synchronization).
The access burst is shorter than the normal burst, and is used only on the
RACH.

<h3><a name="4.2">Speech coding</a></h3>

GSM is a digital system, so speech which is inherently analog, has to
be digitized.  The method employed by ISDN, and by current telephone
systems for multiplexing voice lines over high speed trunks and optical
fiber lines, is Pulse Coded Modulation (PCM).  The output stream from
PCM is 64 kbps, too high a rate to be feasible over a radio link.
The 64 kbps signal, although simple to implement, contains much redundancy.  
The GSM group studied several speech coding algorithms
on the basis of subjective speech quality and complexity (which is
related to cost, processing delay, and power consumption once implemented)
before arriving at the choice of a Regular Pulse Excited -- Linear 
Predictive Coder (RPE--LPC) with a Long Term Predictor loop.  Basically,
information from previous samples, which does not change very quickly,
is used to predict the current sample.  The coefficients of the linear
combination of the previous samples, plus an encoded form of the residual,
the difference between the predicted and actual sample, represent
the signal.
Speech is divided into 20 millisecond samples, each of which is encoded
as 260 bits, giving a total bit rate of 13 kbps.

<h3><a name="4.3">Channel coding and modulation</a></h3>

Because of natural and man-made electromagnetic interference, the 
encoded speech or
data signal transmitted over the radio interface must be protected from errors.
GSM uses convolutional encoding and block 
interleaving to achieve this protection.  The exact algorithms used differ
for speech and for different data rates.  The method used for speech
blocks will be described below.
<p>

Recall that the speech codec produces a 260 bit block for every 20 ms speech
sample.  From subjective testing, it was found that some bits of this block
were more important for perceived speech quality than others.  The bits are thus
divided into three classes:
<ul>
<li><b>Class Ia</b>  50 bits - most sensitive to bit errors
<li><b>Class Ib</b>  132 bits - moderately sensitive to bit errors
<li><b>Class II</b>  78 bits - least sensitive to bit errors
</ul>
Class Ia bits have a 3 bit Cyclic Redundancy Code added for error
detection.  If an error is detected, the frame is judged too damaged
to be comprehensible and it is discarded.  It is replaced by a 
slightly attenuated version of the previous correctly received frame.
These 53 bits, together with the 132 Class Ib bits and a 4 bit tail
sequence (a total of 189 bits), are input into a 1/2 rate convolutional
encoder of constraint length 4.  Each input bit is encoded as two output
bits, based on a combination of the previous 4 input bits.  The 
convolutional encoder thus outputs 378 bits, to which are added the
78 remaining Class II bits, which are unprotected.  Thus every 20 ms
speech sample is encoded as 456 bits, giving a bit rate of 22.8 kbps.
<p>

To further protect against the burst errors common to the radio interface,
each sample is interleaved.  The
456 bits output by the convolutional encoder are divided into 8 blocks of
57 bits, and these blocks are transmitted in eight consecutive time-slot
bursts.  Since each time-slot burst can carry two 57 bit blocks, each
burst carries traffic from two different speech samples.
<p>

Recall that each time-slot burst is transmitted at a gross bit rate
of 270.833 kbps.  This digital signal is modulated onto the analog
carrier frequency using Gaussian-filtered Minimum Shift
Keying (GMSK).  GMSK was selected over other modulation schemes
as a compromise between spectral efficiency, complexity of the
transmitter, and limited spurious emissions.  The complexity of
the transmitter is related to power consumption, which should be
minimized for the mobile station.  The spurious radio emissions,
outside of the allotted bandwidth, must be strictly controlled so
as to limit adjacent channel interference, and allow for the 
co-existence of GSM and the older analog systems 
(at least for the time being).

<h3><a name="4.4">Multipath equalization</a></h3>

At the 900 MHz range, radio waves bounce off everything - buildings,
hills, cars, airplanes, etc.  Thus many reflected signals, each with
a different phase, can reach an antenna.  Equalization is used to
extract the desired signal from the unwanted reflections.  It
works by finding out how a known transmitted signal is modified by multipath
fading, and constructing an inverse filter to extract the rest of
the desired signal.  This known signal is the 26-bit training
sequence transmitted in the middle of every time-slot burst.  The
actual implementation of the equalizer is not specified in the GSM
specifications.

<h3><a name="4.5">Frequency hopping</a></h3>

The mobile station already has to be frequency agile, meaning it can
move between a transmit, receive, and monitor time slot within one TDMA
frame, which normally are on
different frequencies.  GSM makes use of this inherent frequency agility
to implement slow frequency hopping, where the mobile and BTS transmit
each TDMA frame on a different carrier frequency.  The frequency
hopping algorithm is broadcast on the Broadcast Control Channel.
Since multipath fading is dependent on carrier 
frequency, slow frequency
hopping helps alleviate the problem.  In addition, co-channel interference
is in effect randomized.

<h3><a name="4.6">Discontinuous transmission</a></h3>

Minimizing co-channel interference is a goal in any cellular system,
since it allows better service for a given cell size, or the use
of smaller cells, thus increasing the overall capacity of the system.
Discontinuous transmission (DTX) is a method that takes advantage of the
fact that a person speaks less that 40 percent of the time in normal 
conversation <a href="#bib">[22]</a>, by turning
the transmitter off during silence periods.  An added benefit of
DTX is that power is conserved at the mobile unit.
<p>

The most important component of DTX is, of course, Voice Activity
Detection.  It must distinguish between voice and noise inputs,
a task that is not as trivial as it appears, considering background
noise.  If a voice signal is misinterpreted as noise, the transmitter is
turned off and a very annoying effect called clipping is heard at
the receiving end.  If, on the other hand, noise is misinterpreted as
a voice signal too often, the efficiency of DTX is dramatically decreased.
Another factor to consider is that when the transmitter is turned off,
there is total silence heard at the receiving end, due to
the digital nature of GSM.  To assure the receiver that the connection
is not dead, <em>comfort noise</em> is created at the receiving end by
trying to match the characteristics of the transmitting end's background
noise.

<h3><a name="4.7">Discontinuous reception</a></h3>

Another method used to conserve power at the mobile station is
discontinuous reception.  The paging channel, used by the base
station to signal an incoming call, is structured into sub-channels.
Each mobile station needs to listen only to its own sub-channel.
In the time between successive paging sub-channels, the mobile can go into
sleep mode, when almost no power is used.

<h3><a name="4.8">Power control</a></h3>

There are five classes of mobile stations defined, according to their
peak transmitter power, rated at 20, 8, 5, 2, and 0.8 watts. 
To minimize co-channel interference and to conserve power,
both the mobiles and the Base Transceiver Stations operate at
the lowest power level that will maintain an acceptable signal
quality.  Power levels can
be stepped up or down in steps of 2 dB from the peak power for the class
down to a minimum of 13 dBm (20 milliwatts).
<p>

The mobile station measures the signal strength or signal quality
(based on the Bit Error Ratio), and passes the information to the
Base Station Controller, which ultimately decides if
and when the power level should be changed.  Power control should be
handled carefully, since there is the possibility of instability.
This arises from having mobiles in co-channel cells alternatingly
increase their power in response to increased co-channel interference
caused by the other mobile increasing its power.  This in unlikely
to occur in practice but it is (or was as of 1991) under study.

<h2><a name="5">Network aspects</a></h2>

Ensuring the transmission of voice or data of a given quality over 
the radio link is only part of the function of a cellular mobile network.
The fact that the geographical area covered by the network is divided
into cells necessitates the implementation of a handover mechanism.
Also, the fact that the mobile can roam nationally and internationally
in GSM requires that registration, authentication,
call routing and location updating functions exist in the GSM network.
<p>

<img src="tsignal.gif">
<h5>Figure 3.  Signalling protocol structure in GSM</h5>
<p>

The signalling protocol in GSM is structured into three layers 
<a href="#bib">[1], [19]</a>, as shown in Figure 3.  
Layer 1 is the physical layer, which uses the channel 
structures discussed above.  Layer 2 is the data link layer.  Across
the Um interface, the data link layer is a modified version of the
LAPD protocol used in ISDN, called LAPDm.  Across the A interface,
the Message Transfer Part layer 2 of Signalling System Number 7 is used.  
Layer 3 of the GSM signalling protocol is itself divided into 3 sublayers.
<dl>
<dt>Radio Resources Management
<dd>Controls the setup, maintenance, and 
     termination of radio and fixed channels, including handovers.
<dt>Mobility Management
<dd>Manages the location updating and
     registration procedures, as well as security and authentication.
<dt>Connection Management
<dd>Handles general call control, similar
     to CCITT Recommendation Q.931, and manages Supplementary 
     Services and the Short Message Service.
</dl>

Signalling between the different entities in the fixed part of the network, 
such as between the HLR and VLR, is accomplished throught the Mobile 
Application Part (MAP).  MAP is built on top of the
Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP, the top layer of Signalling
System Number 7.  The specification of the MAP is quite complex, and at over
500 pages, it is one of the longest documents in the GSM recommendations 
<a href="#bib">[16]</a>. 

<h3><a name="5.1">Radio resources management</a></h3>

The radio resources management (RR) layer oversees the establishment
of a link, both radio and fixed, between the mobile station and the
MSC.  The main functional components involved are the mobile station,
and the Base Station Subsystem, as well as the MSC.  The RR layer is
concerned with the management of an RR-session <a href="#bib">[16]</a>, which is
the time that a mobile is in dedicated mode, as well as the configuration
of radio channels including the allocation of dedicated channels.
<p>

An RR-session is always initiated by a mobile station through the 
access procedure, either for an outgoing call, or in response to a
paging message.  The details of the access and paging procedures, such
as when a dedicated channel is actually assigned to the mobile, and the
paging sub-channel structure, are handled in the RR layer.  In addition, it
handles the management of radio features such as power control,
discontinuous transmission and reception, and timing advance.

<h4>Handover</h4>

In a cellular network, the radio and fixed links required are not 
permanently allocated for the duration of a call.
Handover, or handoff as it is called in North America, is the switching
of an on-going call to a different channel or cell.  The execution
and measurements required for handover form one of basic functions of
the RR layer.
<p>

There are four different types of handover in the GSM system, which 
involve transferring a call between:
<ul>
<li>Channels (time slots) in the same cell
<li>Cells (Base Transceiver Stations) under the control of the same
      Base Station Controller (BSC),
<li>Cells under the control of different BSCs, but belonging to the same
      Mobile services Switching Center (MSC), and
<li>Cells under the control of different MSCs.
</ul>

The first two types of handover, called internal handovers, involve only
one Base Station Controller (BSC).  To save signalling bandwidth, 
they are managed by the BSC without
involving the Mobile services Switching Center (MSC), except to notify it
at the completion of the handover.  The last two types of handover, called
external handovers, are handled by the MSCs involved.  An important
aspect of GSM is that the original MSC, the <em>anchor MSC</em>, remains
responsible for most call-related functions, with the exception of 
subsequent inter-BSC handovers under the control of the new MSC, called
the <em>relay MSC</em>.
<p>

Handovers can be initiated by either the mobile or the MSC (as a means
of traffic load balancing).  During its idle time slots, the mobile
scans the Broadcast Control Channel of up to 16 neighboring cells, and
forms a list of the six best candidates for possible handover, based on
the received signal strength.  This information is passed to the BSC
and MSC, at least once per second, and is used by the handover algorithm.
<p>

The algorithm for when a handover decision should be taken is not specified
in the GSM recommendations.  There are two basic algorithms used, both
closely tied in with power control.  This is because the BSC usually does not
know whether the poor signal quality is due to multipath fading or to the mobile
having moved to another cell.  This is especially true in small urban
cells.
<p>

The 'minimum acceptable performance' algorithm <a href="#bib">[3]</a> gives precedence 
to power control over handover, so that when the signal degrades beyond a 
certain point, the power level of the mobile is increased.  If further power 
increases do not improve the signal, then a handover is considered.  This is 
the simpler and more common method, but it creates 'smeared' cell boundaries
when a mobile transmitting at peak power goes some distance 
beyond its original cell boundaries into another cell.
<p>

The 'power budget' method <a href="#bib">[3]</a> uses handover to try to
maintain or improve a certain level of signal quality at the same
or lower power level.  It thus gives precedence to handover over
power control.  It avoids the 'smeared' cell boundary problem and reduces
co-channel interference, but it is quite complicated.

<h3><a name="5.2">Mobility management</a></h3>

The Mobility Management layer (MM) is built on top of the RR layer, and
handles the functions that arise from the mobility of the subscriber, as
well as the authentication and security aspects.  Location management 
is concerned with the procedures that enable the system to know the 
current location of a powered-on mobile station
so that incoming call routing can be completed.  

<h4>Location updating</h3>

A powered-on mobile is informed of an incoming call by a paging
message sent over the PAGCH channel of a cell.  One extreme would
be to page every cell in the network for each call, which is obviously
a waste of radio bandwidth.  The other extreme would be for the
mobile to notify the system, via location updating messages, of its
current location at the individual cell level.  This would require paging
messages to be sent to exactly one cell, but would be very wasteful
due to the large number of location updating messages.  A compromise
solution used in GSM is to group cells into <em>location areas</em>.  Updating
messages are required when moving between location areas, and mobile
stations are paged in the cells of their current location area.
<p>

The location updating procedures, and subsequent call routing, use the MSC 
and two location registers:  the Home Location Register (HLR) and the 
Visitor Location Register (VLR).
When a mobile station is switched on in a new location area, or it moves to
a new location area or different operator's PLMN, it must register with the
network to indicate its current location.
In the normal case, a location update message is sent to the new MSC/VLR, 
which records the location area information, and then sends the location 
information to the subscriber's HLR.  The information sent to the HLR is 
normally the
SS7 address of the new VLR, although it may be a routing number.  The
reason a routing number is not normally assigned, even though it would
reduce signalling, is that there is only a limited number of routing
numbers available in the new MSC/VLR and they are allocated on demand for
incoming calls.  If the subscriber is entitled to service, the HLR sends
a subset of the subscriber information, needed for call control, to the new 
MSC/VLR, and sends a message to the old MSC/VLR to cancel the old 
registration.
<p>

For reliability reasons, GSM also has a periodic location updating procedure.
If an HLR or MSC/VLR fails, to have each mobile register simultaneously to
bring the database up to date would cause overloading.  Therefore, the
database is updated as location updating events occur.  The enabling of
periodic updating, and the time period between periodic updates, is 
controlled by the operator, and is a trade-off between signalling traffic
and speed of recovery.  If a mobile does not register after the
updating time period, it is deregistered.
<p>

A procedure related to location updating is the IMSI attach and detach.
A detach lets the network know that the mobile station is unreachable,
and avoids having to needlessly allocate channels and send paging messages.
An attach is similar to a location update, and informs the system that
the mobile is reachable again.  The activation of IMSI attach/detach is
up to the operator on an individual cell basis.

<h4>Authentication and security</h4>

Since the radio medium can be accessed by anyone, authentication of
users to prove that they are who they claim to be, is a very important
element of a mobile network.  Authentication involves two functional
entities, the SIM card in the mobile, and the Authentication Center (AuC).
Each subscriber is given a secret key, one copy of which
is stored in the SIM card and the other in the AuC.
During authentication, the AuC generates a random number that it sends to
the mobile.  Both the mobile and the AuC then use the random number, in
conjuction with the subscriber's secret key and a ciphering algorithm
called A3, to generate a signed response (SRES) that is sent back to the AuC.
If the number sent by the mobile is the same as the one calculated by the AuC,
the subscriber is authenticated <a href="#bib">[16]</a>.
<p>

The same initial random number and subscriber key are also used to compute
the ciphering key using an algorithm called A8.  This ciphering key, 
together with the TDMA frame number, use the A5 algorithm
to create a 114 bit sequence that is XORed with the 114 bits of a burst
(the two 57 bit blocks).  Enciphering is an option 
for the fairly
paranoid, since the signal is already coded, interleaved, and transmitted
in a TDMA manner, thus providing protection from all but the most
persistent and dedicated eavesdroppers.
<p>

Another level of security is performed on the mobile equipment itself, 
as opposed to the mobile subscriber.  As mentioned earlier, each GSM 
terminal is identified by a unique International Mobile Equipment Identity 
(IMEI) number.  A list of IMEIs in the network is stored in the Equipment 
Identity Register (EIR).  The status returned in response to an IMEI query 
to the EIR is one of the following:
<dl>
<dt>White-listed
<dd>The terminal is allowed to connect to the network.
<dt>Grey-listed
<dd>The terminal is under observation from the network
                   for possible problems.
<dt>Black-listed
<dd>The terminal has either been reported stolen,
                    or is not type approved (the correct type
                    of terminal for a GSM network).  The terminal is
                    not allowed to connect to the network.
</dl>

<h3><a name="5.3">Communication management</a></h3>

The Communication Management layer (CM) is responsible for Call Control
(CC), supplementary service management, and short message service management.
Each of these may be considered as a separate sublayer within the CM layer.
Call control attempts to follow the ISDN procedures specified in Q.931,
although routing to a roaming mobile subscriber is obviously unique to 
GSM.  Other functions of the CC sublayer include call establishment,
selection of the type of service (including alternating between services
during a call), and call release.
  
<h4>Call routing</h4>

Unlike routing in the fixed network, where a terminal is semi-permanently
wired to a central office, a GSM user can roam nationally and even
internationally.  
The directory number dialed to reach a mobile subscriber is called the Mobile
Subscriber ISDN (MSISDN), which is defined by the E.164 numbering plan.
This number includes a country code and a National Destination Code which
identifies the subscriber's operator.  The first few digits of the
remaining subscriber number may identify the subscriber's HLR within the home
PLMN.  
<p>

An incoming mobile terminating call is directed to the Gateway MSC (GMSC)
function.  The GMSC is basically a switch which is able to interrogate the
subscriber's HLR to obtain routing information, and thus contains a table
linking MSISDNs to their corresponding HLR.  A simplification is to
have a GSMC handle one specific PLMN.  It should be noted that the 
GMSC function is
distinct from the MSC function, but is usually implemented in an MSC.
<p>

The routing information that is returned to the GMSC is the Mobile
Station Roaming Number (MSRN), which is also defined by the E.164
numbering plan.  MSRNs are related to the geographical numbering plan,
and not assigned to subscribers, nor are they visible to subscribers.
<p>

The most general routing procedure begins with the GMSC querying the called
subscriber's HLR for an MSRN.  The HLR typically stores only the SS7
address of the subscriber's current VLR, and does not have the MSRN
(see the location updating section).  The HLR must therefore query the
subscriber's current VLR, which will temporarily allocate an MSRN from its
pool for the call.  This MSRN is returned to the HLR and back to
the GMSC, which can then route the call to the new MSC.
At the new MSC, the IMSI corresponding to the MSRN is looked up, and
the mobile is paged in its current location area (see Figure 4).

<h2><a name="6">Conclusion and comments</a></h2>

In this paper I have tried to give an overview of the GSM system.  As
with any overview, and especially one covering a standard 6000 pages
long, there are many details missing.  I believe, however, that I gave
the general flavor of GSM and the philosophy behind its design.
It was a monumental task that the original GSM committee
undertook, and one that has proven a success, showing that international
cooperation on such projects between academia, industry, and
government can succeed.  It is a standard that ensures interoperability
without stifling competition and innovation among suppliers, to the benefit of
the public both in terms of cost and service quality.  For example, by
using Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) microprocessor technology,
many functions of the mobile station can be built on one chipset,
resulting in lighter, more compact, and more energy-efficient terminals.
<p>

Telecommunications are evolving towards personal communication networks,
whose objective can be stated as
the availability of all communication services anytime,
anywhere, to anyone, by a single identity number and a pocketable
communication terminal <a href="#bib">[25]</a>.  Having a multitude of
incompatible systems throughout the world moves us farther away from
this ideal.  The economies of scale created by a unified system
are enough to justify its implementation, not to mention the convenience
to people of carrying just one communication terminal anywhere they go, 
regardless of national boundaries.
<p>

The GSM system, and its twin system operating at 1800 MHz, called DCS1800, are
a first approach at a true personal communication system.  The SIM card
is a novel approach that implements personal mobility in addition to
terminal mobility.  Together with international roaming, and support
for a variety of services such as telephony, data transfer, fax, Short Message
Service, and supplementary services,
GSM comes close to fulfilling
the requirements for a personal communication system: close enough
that it is being used as a basis for the next generation of
mobile communication technology in Europe, the Universal Mobile 
Telecommunication System (UMTS).
<p>

Another point where GSM has shown its commitment to openness, standards and 
interoperability is the compatibility with the Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) that is evolving in most industrialized countries, and
Europe in particular (the so-called Euro-ISDN).  GSM is the first
system to make extensive use of the Intelligent Networking concept, in
in which services like 800 numbers are concentrated and handled from
a few centralized service centers, instead of being distributed over every
switch in the country.  This is the concept behind the use of 
the various registers such as the HLR.  In addition, the signalling between 
these functional entities uses Signalling System Number 7, an international
standard already deployed in many countries and specified as the backbone
signalling network for ISDN.
<p>

GSM is a very complex standard, but that is probably the price that must
be paid to achieve the level of integrated service and quality offered
while subject to the rather severe restrictions imposed by
the radio environment.
