<h3> Abstract</h3>
<h5>
  GSM, the Global System for Mobile
  communications, is a digital cellular 
  communications system which has rapidly gained acceptance and 
  market share worldwide, although it
  was initially developed in a 
  European context.  In addition to digital transmission, GSM
  incorporates many advanced services and features, including
  ISDN compatibility and worldwide roaming in other GSM networks.  
  The advanced services and architecture of GSM have made it
  a model for future third-generation cellular systems, such as UMTS.
  This paper will give an overview of the services offered by GSM, the 
  system architecture, the radio transmission structure, and the
  signalling functional architecture.
</h5>
<h3>Introduction and history of GSM</h3>

The development of GSM started in 1982, when the 
Conference of European Posts and Telegraphs (CEPT) formed a study group
called Groupe Sp&eacute;cial Mobile (the initial meaning of GSM).  The
group was to study and develop a pan-European public cellular system
in the 900 MHz range, using spectrum that had been previously allocated.
At that time, there were many incompatible analog cellular systems
in various European countries.  Some of the basic criteria for their
proposed system were:
<ul>
<li> Good subjective speech quality
<li> Low terminal and service cost
<li> Support for international roaming
<li> Ability to support handheld terminals
<li> Support for range of new services and facilities
<li> Spectral efficiency
<li> ISDN compatibility
</ul>

In 1989, the responsibility for GSM was transferred to the European
Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI), and the Phase I
recommendations were published in 1990.  At that time, the
United Kingdom requested a specification based on 
GSM but for higher user densities with low-power mobile stations, and
operating at 1.8 GHz.
The specifications for this system, called Digital
Cellular System (DCS1800) were published 1991.  Commercial operation
of GSM networks started in mid-1991 in European countries.  By the 
beginning
of 1995, there were 60 countries with operational or planned
GSM networks in Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australia,
Africa, and South America, with 
a total of over 5.4 million subscribers.

<h3>Services provided by GSM</h3>

GSM was designed having interoperability with ISDN in mind, and
the services provided by GSM are a subset of the standard ISDN services.
Speech is the most basic, and most important, teleservice provided by
GSM.
<p>
In addition, various data services are supported, with user bit rates up
to 9600 bps.  Specially equipped GSM terminals can connect with PSTN,
ISDN, Packet Switched and Circuit Switched Public Data Networks, through several
possible methods, using synchronous or asynchronous transmission.
Also supported are Group 3 facsimile service, videotex, and teletex.
Other GSM services include a cell broadcast service, where messages
such as traffic reports, are broadcast to users in particular cells.
<p>
A service unique to GSM, the Short Message Service, allows users to
send and receive point-to-point alphanumeric messages up to a few tens 
of bytes.
It is similar to paging services, but much more comprehensive, allowing
bi-directional messages, store-and-forward delivery, and acknowledgement 
of successful delivery. 
<p>
Supplementary services enhance the set of
basic teleservices.  In the Phase I specifications, supplementary services
include variations of call forwarding and call barring, such as Call
Forward on Busy or Barring of Outgoing International Calls.  Many more
supplementary services, including multiparty calls, advice of charge,
call waiting, and calling line identification presentation will be
offered in the Phase 2 specifications.

<h3>System architecture</h3>

The functional architecture of a GSM system can be broadly divided
into the mobile station, the base station subsystem, and the
network subsystem.  Each subsystem is comprised of functional
entities which communicate through the various interfaces using
specified protocols.

<h5>Mobile Station</h5>

The mobile station in GSM is really two distinct entities.  The
actual hardware is the mobile equipment, which is anonymous.  
The subscriber information, which includes a unique identifier
called the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), is
stored in the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), implemented as
a smart card.  By inserting the SIM card in any GSM mobile
equipment, the user is able to make and receive calls at that terminal
and receive other subscribed services.  By decoupling subscriber
information from a specific terminal, personal mobility is provided
to GSM users.

<h5>Base Station Subsystem</h5>

The Base Station Subsystem is composed of two parts, the Base
Transceiver Station (BTS) and the Base Station Controller (BCS).
The BTS houses the radio tranceivers that define
a cell and handles the radio (Um) interface protocols with the mobile 
station.
Due to the potentially large number of BTSs, the requirements for a BTS are
ruggedness, reliability, portability, and minimum cost.
<p>
The Base Station Controller (BSC) manages the radio resources for one 
or more BTSs, across the Abis interface.  It manages the radio interface 
channels (setup, teardown, frequency hopping, etc.) as well as 
handovers.  

<h5>Network Subsystem</h5>

The central component of the Network Subsystem is the Mobile services
Switching Center (MSC).  It acts like a normal switching node of the
PSTN or ISDN, and in addition provides all the functionality needed
to handle a mobile subscriber, including registration, authentication,
location updating, inter-MSC handovers, and call routing to a roaming subscriber.
These services are provided in conjuction with four intelligent
databases, which together with the MSC form the 
Network Subsystem.  The MSC also
provides the connection to the public fixed networks.
<p>
The Home Location Register (HLR) contains all
the administrative information of each subscriber registered in the
corresponding GSM network, along with the current location of the subscriber.
The location assists in routing incoming calls to the mobile, and is 
typically the SS7 address of the visited MSC.  There is logically 
one HLR per GSM network, although it may be implemented as a distributed
database.
<p>
The Visitor Location Register contains selected administrative information
from the HLR, necessary for call control and provision of the subscribed
services, for each mobile currently located in the geographical area
controlled by the VLR.  Although the VLR can be 
implemented as an independent unit, to date all manufacturers of switching
equipment implement the VLR together with the MSC, so that the geographical
area controlled by the MSC corresponds to that controlled by the VLR.  
The proximity of the VLR information to the MSC speeds up access
to information that the MSC requires during a call.
<p>
The other two registers are used for authentication and security purposes.
The Equipment Identity Register (EIR) is a database that contains a list of
all valid mobile equipment on the network, where each mobile equipment
is identified by its International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI).  An
IMEI is marked as invalid if it has been reported stolen or is not
type approved.  The Authentication Center (AuC) is a protected database 
that stores a copy of the secret key stored in each subscriber's SIM card,
used for authentication and ciphering on the radio channel.

<h3>Radio transmission aspects</h3>

The radio spectrum in the bands 890-915 MHz for the uplink (mobile 
station to base station) and 935-960 MHz for the downlink has been
reserved in Europe for mobile networks.  At least 10 MHz in each band
was reserved explicitly for GSM.  This 2x25 MHz spectrum
is divided into 200 kHz carrier frequencies using FDMA.  
One or more carrier
frequencies are assigned to individual base stations, and each carrier is
divided into eight time slots using TDMA.  Groups of eight consecutive
time slots form <b>TDMA frames</b>, with a duration of 4.615 ms.  
A transmission channel occupies one time slot position within a TDMA
frame.  TDMA frames of a particular carrier
frequency are numbered, and both the mobile station and the base station
are synchronized on this number.  Larger frames are formed from groups 
of 26 and 51 TDMA frames (there are also larger groups), and
position within such frames defines the type and function of a channel.
<p>
There is a basic distinction between <b>dedicated</b> and <b>idle</b>
modes, that arises from on-demand channel allocation due to spectrum
scarcity.  Dedicated, or traffic, channels provide a bi-directional point-to-point
transmission link to a mobile subscriber.  Full-rate Traffic Channels
(TCH/F) and half-rate Traffic Channels (TCH/H) are allocated together 
with a low bit-rate Slow Associated
Control Channel (SACCH), which typically transmits measurements needed for
handover decisions.  There are also eighth-rate Traffic Channels, also
called Stand-alone Dedicated Control Channels (SDCCH), which are used
primarily for transmitting location updating information.  In
addition, a TCH slot can be pre-empted for signalling, in which case
it is called a Fast Associated Control Channel (FACCH), which can be
either full-rate or half-rate. TCHs are defined within a 26-frame 
multiframe.
<p>
Common channels can be accessed both by idle mode mobiles, in order
to change to dedicated mode, and by dedicated mode mobiles, to monitor
surrounding base stations for handover information.  The common channels,
which are defined within a 51-frame multiframe, include:
<dl>
<dt>Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH)
<dd> Continually broadcasts,
      on the downlink, information including base station identity, 
      frequency allocations, and frequency-hopping sequences.
<dt>Frequency Correction Channel (FCCH) and Synchronisation Channel
      (SCH)
<dd> Used to synchronise the mobile to the time slot structre of a 
      cell by defining the beginning of a TDMA frame.
<dt>Random Access Channel (RACH)
<dd>Slotted Aloha channel used by the
      mobile to request access to the network.
<dt>Paging Channel (PCH)
<dd> Used to alert the mobile station of
      incoming call.
<dt>Access Grant Channel (AGCH)
<dd>Used to allocate an SDCCH to
      a mobile for signalling (in order to obtain a dedicated channel), 
      following a request on the RACH.
</dl>

<h5>Speech and channel coding</h5>

Speech in GSM is digitally coded at a rate of 13 kbps, so-called
full-rate speech coding.  This is
quite efficient compared with the standard ISDN rate of 64 kbps.
One of the most important Phase 2 additions will be the introduction
of a half-rate speech codec operating at around 7 kbps, effectively
doubling the capacity of a network.  
<p>
This 13 kbps digital stream (260 bits every 20 ms)
has forward error correction added by a convolutional encoder.
The gross bit rate after channel coding is 22.8 kbps (or 456 bits every
20 ms).  These 456 bits are divided into 8 57-bit blocks, and the result is 
interleaved amongst eight successive time slot bursts for protection
against bursty transmission errors.
<p>
Each time slot burst is 156.25 bits and contains two 57-bit blocks,
and a 26-bit training sequence used for equalization.  A burst is
transmitted in 0.577 ms for a total bit rate of 270.8 kbps, and is
modulated using Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) onto the 200 kHz
carrier frequency.  The
26-bit training sequence is of a known pattern that is compared with
the received pattern in the hope of being able
to reconstruct the rest of the original signal.  Forward error control
and equalization contribute to the robustness of GSM
radio signals against interference and multipath fading.
<p>
The digital TDMA nature of the signal allows several processes intended to
improve transmission quality, increase the mobile's battery life, 
and improve spectrum efficiency.  These include discontinuous transmission, 
frequency hopping and discontinuous reception when monitoring the paging
channel.  Another feature used by GSM is power control, which attempts
to minimize the radio transmission power of the mobiles and the BTS, 
and thus minimize the amount of co-channel interference generated.

<h3>Network aspects</h3>

Radio transmission forms the lowest functional layer in GSM.  In
any telecommunication system, signalling is required to coordinate the
necessarily distributed functional entities of the network.  The
transfer of signalling information in GSM follows the layered OSI
model.  On top of the physical layer described above is the data link
layer providing error-free transmission between adjacent entities, based
on the ISDN's LAPD protocol for the Um and Abis interfaces, and on
SS7's Message Transfer Protocol (MTP) for the other interfaces.
The functional layers above the data link layer are responsible for
Radio Resource management (RR), Mobility Management (MM) and Call
Management (CM).
<p>
The RR functional layer is responsible for providing a reliable
radio link between the mobile station and the network infrastructure.
This includes the establishment and allocation of radio channels on
the Um interface, as well as the establishment of A interface links
to the MSC.  The handover procedures, an essential element of cellular
systems, is managed at this layer, which involves the mobile station,
the base station subsystem, and, to a lesser degree, the MSC.  Several
protocols are used between the different network elements to provide
RR functionality.
<p>
The MM functinal layer assumes a reliable RR-connection, and is responsible for 
location management and security.  Location management involves the
procedures and signalling for location updating, so that the mobile's
current location is stored at the HLR, allowing incoming
calls to be properly routed.  Security involves the authentication of
the mobile, to prevent unauthorised access to the network, as well
as the encryption of all radio link traffic.  The protocols in the
MM layer involve the SIM, MSC, VLR, and the HLR, as well as the
AuC (which is closely tied with the HLR).  The machines in the
network subsystem exchange signalling information through the Mobile
Application Part (MAP), which is built on top of SS7.
<p>
The CM functional layer is divided into three sublayers.  The Call
Control (CC) sublayer manages call routing, establishment, maintenance, and 
release, and
is closely related to ISDN call control.  The idea is for CC to be as
independent as possible from the underlying specifics of the mobile network.
Another sublayer is Supplementary Services, which manages the
implementation of the various supplementary services, and also allows 
users to access and modify their service subscription.  The final sublayer
is the Short Message Service layer, which handles the routing and delivery of
short messages, both from and to the mobile subscriber.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The development of GSM is the first step towards a true personal
communication system that will allow communication anywhere, anytime,
and with anyone.  The functional architecture of GSM, employing intelligent
networking principles, and its ideology,
which provides enough standardization to ensure compatibility, but
still allows manufacturers and operators freedom, has been widely adopted
in the development of future wireless systems.
