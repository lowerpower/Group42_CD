GENERAL NOTES:

HANDSETS:  Most Motorola handsets are interchangeable, when a handset is
used with a transceiver other than the one it was designed for the display
will show "LOANER".  Some features and buttons may not work, for instance
if the original handset did not have a RCL or STO button, and the
replacement does, you will have to use the control * or control # sequence
to access memory and A/B system select procedures.



LOCK/UNLOCK PROCEDURES:

     Phones with "LOCK" buttons:  Press lock for at least 1/2 a second.

     Phones with a "FCN" button:  Press FCN 5, note that 5 has the letter's
                                  "J,K, and L" for lock.

     Phones with no FCN or LOCK button:  Press Control 5, control is the black
                                         volume button on the side of the
                                         handset.


SYSTEM SELECT PROCEDURES:

     Phones with a RCL button:  Press RCL *, then * to select, STO to store.

     Phones with no RCL button: Press Control * then * to select, # to store.
