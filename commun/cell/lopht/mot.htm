The ubiquitous cellular phone, Motorolas are fairly easy to program. 
First, check the <a href="motbible.txt">Motorola Bible (v. 2.0)</a> for general 
info. Most can be programmed from the <a 
href="keypad_p.txt">keypad</a>,
though only three 
times. The phones can be put into a <a 
href="testmode.txt">test
mode</a> by means of a jumper. Then you can enter interesting <a 
href="tst_cmds.txt">test mode
commands</a>, read the <a href="motsid.txt">System ID</a> from the data 
channel and <a 
href="fovchack.txt">monitor
phone calls</a> to impress your friends and annoy the government.<p> <p>
If you lost the manual and don't know how to use your motorola, <a 
href="general.txt">do not fret</a>.
<p>
We have the pinouts for the Motorola Bag Phone's 8-pin (RJ-45) <a 
href="handset.txt">handset
connector</a>, as well as its 25-pin (DB-25) <a 
href="pin25.txt">data port</a>, and the 8000 series hand held
"brick phone" <a href="mot8000.pin"> jack</a> too.<p>
If you're really hard core, and can handle a soldering iron, then take some 
wire, connectors, and resistors to make a <a 
href="reprog.htm">reprogramming
cable</a> to hook your phone up to your computer to do neat stuff, 
including changing your ESN (Serial Number).<p>

Motorola has different <a 
href="newesn94.mot">ESN
prefixes</a> for AMPS, NAMPS, and TDMA phones. By <a 
href="motosn.txt">decoding the mechanical serial number</a>, the date and 
place of manufacture can be discovered, and also the warrantee period. <p>


<p>
If you have access to an EPROM programmer, take a look at these <a 
href="motoprom.htm">PROM dumps</a>. Not surprisingly, Motorola
phones use Motorola
microcontrollers.
