    number 41-2012, if you have one attach it between the data cable and the
    transceiver and power up the phone.

    D plug and a 15 pin D socket.  Wire it straight through and jumper pins
    2 and 11.  Connect this between the tranceiver and data cable and power
    up the phone.

    in both NAMs, call timers and memory locations.  Note that if this is
    done the unit will wake up in full lock mode, to unlock the unit press
    FCN # L L L L, where LLLL is the lock code of the LAST NAM programed.

    NAM 2.
