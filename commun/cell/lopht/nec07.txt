1.  This phone officially requires an NEC programing adaptor part
    number 41-2012, if you have one attach it between the data cable and the
    transceiver and power up the phone.

    If you do not have a programing adaptor one can be made from a 15 pin
    D plug and a 15 pin D socket.  Wire it straight through and jumper pins
    2 and 11.  Connect this between the transceiver and data cable and power
    up the phone.

    (New units may display FAULT 3 when first turned on, this is normal.
    With your programing adaptor installed initialize the phone by entering
    RCL # 0 1, RCL # 5 2, RCL # 0 2.  The phone should re-cycle and wake up
    with no FAULT code.)

    RCL # 0 1 to enter test mode.
