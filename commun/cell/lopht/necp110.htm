EC P110</h2>
<hr>
This info was gleaner off of alt.cellular-phone-tech. I don't know if it's
at all correct.

(lock-code) FCN-9 (lock-code)  FCN MEM 76  MEM #01 MEM #71
use 3 to step through, hold CLR to exit command. MEM #24 reads ESN.
MEM #02 to exit.
The default lock code is 0000, 1234, or the last 4 digits of the phone number.
If you can't get this to work, you need a dongle (hardware) to get into the phone's test mode.
<p>
The text here would indicate that the commands are somewhat like the P200. check that phone's instructions for info. Please mail me what you find.
