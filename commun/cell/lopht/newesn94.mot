Subject: Motorola ESN's of 82xxxxxx and C3xxxxxx

The range of the Narrow AMPS ESN's of the C3xxxxxx has been extended.

Motorola has been approved by the FCC to begin shipping domestic cellular
subscriber units with ESN's beginning with C3 in addition to the current range
of ESN's beginning with 82. The new manufacturers code (C3) will be used on all
products (AMPS, NAMPS, and TDMA) and will be used concurrently with the earlier
manufacturer's code (82).

The range of ESN numbers may be used to identify the type of Motorola Fone.

[Check with your system operator to verify your cellular switch is capable of
operating with ESN's in all of these ranges. There have been situations in the
past where the switch software was not updated to recognize the new ESN ranges,
and customers were unable to complete phone calls as a result.]
