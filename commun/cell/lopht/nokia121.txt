The 121 is very similar to Nokia's 101/201 series (it IS the same phone
except for keypad layout and software...Technophone also has a model
that is the same (course they were bought out by Technophone, so I guess
it stands to reason)). locations 1 & 2 contain the info for NAM 1 while
4 & 5 pertain to NAM 2. Since I don't have my notes, etc with me, I'm 
not sure of the 121's layout, but for the 101/201 here's the prog seq...

*3001#12345 <STO> 00  (Display shows "store not done")
RCL 01 gives you the country code, emergency quick call number and lock code
RCL 02 gives you the 10 digit phone number
RCL 03 gives you the SYS ID (5 digits, 3 of which are not seen as they scroll
       off the screen when prog'ing phone, Local access bit, MIN mark,
       initial control channel, access overload class and Group ID.

Those 3 memory locations are for NAM 1, and 4&5 are for NAM 2 (mem location
01 is common to both NAMS)
