The Novatel 8325 is a bag-style portable cellular telephone. It is known as a

'ProClassic' in Novatel MarketSpeak. Two different handsets (control units) are

used with the 8325 transeiver: the 4130 and 5160. My phone has the 5160.

The handsets appear very similar: I doubt there is any functional difference

between them. Earlier transceivers, such as the 8320, contain many of the same

features as the 8325, though the hidden menus are accessed with different

codes. The only other code I know of is #746, which is the code for the 8320

CFG menu.

 

Terms: Throughout this article, I will refer to things without explaining them

each time. If you get lost, refer to the table below.

 

NORMAL = the phone is in this mode when it is not locked, or in either of the

hidden menus, or in the 'user' menus accessed by the MENU key. The screen will

display either READY or SCANNING when in normal mode. This is the mode the phone

is in when it is first turned on.

 

LOCKED = when the phone displays LOCKED, a code must be typed to enter normal

mode. The default code is 1234. The telephone can be locked using [FCN] 1 [SND]

from normal mode. The phone must be locked before entering in any of the codes

to access the hidden menus described below.

 

TBL = troubleshooting mode = the hidden menu accessed with 546*. This is a

menu supposedly know only to Novatel, not even their dealers are supposed to

know about it. According to Novatel, some of the features in this menu could

destroy the phone if improperly set. Scare tactics? you decide.

 

CFG = configuration mode = the hidden menu accessed with 510*. This is used by

dealers to set up a subscriber's service. As far as I know, there is nothing

particularly dangerous about this mode, but Novatel is touchy about it 

nonetheless. I take no resposibility for any damages.

 

 

 

 

Troubleshooting Mode - TBL

 

First, lock phone with [FCN] 1 [SND]

Then, enter 546* on the keypad. The phone 

will not make tones for each key pressed.

 

TBL 8325    /___ This is what shows up on my fone.

REV NA0C    \    Yours may be different.

 

You are now in troubleshooting mode. You may page through the functions

by using the arrow keys, or access the functions by number, by hitting #

(The screen will display DIR PAGE ACCESS) and then the function number,

from the chart below. Note that on initially entering Troubleshooting mode,

you are on function 37. Toggle with the [SND] key, unless otherwise noted.

                       is the last NAM examined, or 1 when entering this menu

                       the first time.

 

 

I will be dispensing with the arrows from this point on. First we start with

the common configuration. Hit the 0 key.

 

COMMON

CONFIG

 

INIT NAM        Initalize NAM memory - ALL of them! This is dangerous.

USE SND         Values in the NAMs are replaced by factory defaults.

 

INIT ICM        Initial Configuration Mode - Resets everything back to

USE SND         factory defaults. You need a special PCB boardwith a 'key'

                on it for this to work, according to Novatel.

 

INIT REP        Initialize Reperatory - This means clearing out ALL of the

USE SND         memory for storing phone numbers!

 

LOCKCODE        The code used to unlock the phone. Not too useful if you know

1234            about 510* and 546*.

 

CHANGE          To change the lock code, enter the OLD lockcode, displayed

LOCKCODE        in the previous option. the NEW CODE FFFF menu will appear,

                enter the new 4 digit code, then [SND].

 

BIL CODE        The code to get into the BIL menu. C means # and A means *.

C185            So from the LOCKED mode I would enter #185 for the BIL menu.

 

QRC SET         Quick Recall - very convenient. 10 memories, 0-9. To use, in 

		normal mode just hit which memory you want and [SND].

  

QST SET         Quick Store - store numbers in above memories. In normal mode

		type in a phone number, [FCN] [FCN] and the memory localtion.

  

WUT SET         Wake Up Tone - The sound the phone makes when first turned on.

 

MLH CLR         Mobile to Land Hold - Accumulated air time counts all mobile-

		to-land time when SET, ignores calls less than 30 seconds 

		when CLR.

  

LMH CLR         Land to Mobile Hold. See above to figure it out.

  

CRU CLR         Call Round Up - round times up to nearest minute.

  

EE  SET         Extended DTMF Enable, during call.

 

NLM CLR         No Land to Mobile. Do not count land originated calls in call

                timer.

 

HAL CLR         Horn Alert

 

ONL SET         Online Diagnostics. Activate by [FCN] 9 from normal mode.

		displays channel number, power level, received signal

		strength, and digital color code. I think it's neat, and leave

		it on all the time. Note that it overrides everything, and

		stays on even when the phone is locked. To get rid of it,

		either turn the phone off and on again, or toggle it with

		[FCN] 9 from normal mode.

 

PLACBITH      Placement Bits - a reading from the data stream -- ??

    ** *      

 

Pressing the [UP] key at this point just goes around to the start of the

common config again. Use [END] to return to the NAM selection menu.

 

Select a NAM 1 through 4. I start with NAM 1 here.

 

NAM 1         [SND] toggles ENABLED / DISABLED except on NAM 1, which 

ENABLED       cannot be disabled. Enabled means you can use it from normal mode.

 

MIN  312      Mobile Identification Number - the phone number - enter the new

555-0990      number, then [SND].

 

SIDH	      System ID - a number designating the serving area (city) an 

0010          cellular carrier (company) of the subscriber. Even numbers

              designate wire-line (System A) carriers, Odd numbers

	      Non-wire-line (System B) carriers. Enter 5 digit number, [SND}

 

TO EXIT       When installing a new NAM, most times you can just finish here

NOW--END      and leave the rest of the settings at their default values. To

              do so, hit [END].

 

IPCH          Initial Paging Channel. 0333 for System A carriers, 0334 for

0334          System B carriers. Enter 4 digit channel number, [SND].

 

 

EX  SET       Extended address - to dial more than 7 digits. always set.

 

IDCCA         IPCH scan start for A systems. Should be 0333.

0333          Enter 4 digit channel number, [SND].

 

IDCCB         IPCH scan start for B systems. Should be 0334.

0334          Enter 4 digit channel number, [SND].

 

ACCOLC        Access Overload Class. A sort of 'Priority' designation. It

08            doesn't seem to really do anything. Enter 00 through 15, [SND].

 

GROUP ID	Cell carrier sub division. This setting is not known to have

MARK  10	any effect on service.

 

 

 

REG TBL         Registration Table Size. Novatel says it should always be 1.

SIZE  1         Enter 0-4, [SND].

 

LU CLR          Local Use - SET prohibits calls outside the local area.

 

 

INVLD ID        Invalid ID - a list of System IDs to never use. Useful when

  1 NONE        you want to avoid inadvertantly wandering into an area

  2 NONE        with a cellular carrier that scalps you for roaming fees.

  3 NONE        Hit #, the 5 digit System Id number, then [SND]

  4 NONE

 

 

  FD  SET       Touch-Tone dialing. Always have set.

  MFD SET       Extended DTMF. SET for continuous tones, 

                CLR for fixed-time tones

 

32D SET         32 Digit Dialing - always have set.

 

PS  CLR         Default system. CLR = B, SET = A.

 

IRI CLR         CLR allows user to prefer system A or B from normal mode, by

		using [FCN] [SND] to display preference, and [SND] again to

		toggle. System preference function not available when the HOM

                option is set because the HOME function uses the same keys.

 

           (Note: confused? the HOM option is that which we set here

            in the CFG menu, enabling the HOME function to be used from

            normal mode.)

 

HOM CLR         When HOM is SET, [FCN] [SND] in normal mode shows the HOME

                status. [SND] a second time toggles it. When HOME is ON, all

                calls are restricted to your home system.

 

SSD SET         Signal Strength Indicator. When SET, in normal mode the bottom

                line of the display shows the received signal strength. When

                SSD is CLR, the bottom line in normal mode displays the System

                Preference, or ONLY if IRI (see above) is SET. When SSD is set

                and you want to see which operating condition is active, HOME,

                PREF, or ONLY, in normal mode type [FCN] [SND] [UP].

 

Billing Mode - BIL

 

1) lock the phone with [FCN] 1 [SND].

2) enter #185.

3) If the screen reads BIL 8325 REV NA0C (or something similar) then go to 4.

   Else,the phone still says LOCKED, enter 510*. Use the [UP] key to get to the

   screen that reads NAM1 SEL 0-4 END. Hit 0. Hit the [UP] key 7 times to get

   to the BIL CODE screen. The number on the bottom line is the code used to

   enter the Billing Mode. A "C" stands for the # sign, and "A" means the *

   sign. Write this code down. Hit [END] [END] to exit the CFG mode, and 

   restart at step one, using this code instead of #185.

4) The BIL mode has 10 screens, most of them fairly boring compared to the CFG

   and TBL modes. Like the TBL mode, BIL mode allows use of the # key to 

   directly access a given screen rather than stepping through each one with 

   [UP] and [DN] keys. Note direct access is not available from the NEW CODE

   screen, as this is interpreted literally. Use [UP] or [DN] to leave that

   screen. Below is a table of the screens available. the number on the left

   is the screen number, for use with the # sign.
