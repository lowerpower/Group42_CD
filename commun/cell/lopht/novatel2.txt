NOVATEL 8320 Programming
----------=?> DOCTOR WHO <?=-----------
v. 3/8/95

This file is an addendum to my file on the Novatel 8325 which originally
appeared unaccredited in Phrack. Read it first.

This is an alpha version of this file and will most likely undergo great 
changes. Check back here occasionally until this messages dissappears. 
The 8320 is an earlier version of the 8325 and is basically the same. It
appears that the test codes vary by software version though, so try every
thing in all combinations if you don't at first succeed.

 CFG         #259
 CNF                   #259

 SVC         #83*      #83*
 BIL         #185      #185

SVC mode appears to be TBL mode without access to functions over 35.

The 8320 lacks the following 8325 commands:

34  NVM Test
36  NVM Clear
42  DPOT Clear
43  Micro, Expand, TX Limit
47  Analog Switch 1
48  Analog Switch 2
49  Power Level, DAC
50  PL3@5000
