<font size = +2>T</font>he OKI-900 is the phone most favored by cellular 
experimenters. A company called
Network Wizards(http://www.nw.com) has produced a hardware/software
package for the 900 and 1150 called <i>The Cellular
Telephone Experimenters Kit </i> (CTEK). <a href="okipad.zip">OkiPad</a> is a
Windows NT / Windows 95 utility for the Oki. The <a href="oki04.txt">NAM</a> is 
easily reprogrammed. <a href="debug.doc">Debug mode</a> 
has several interesting functions and  is accessable from the keypad without any 
special hardware. The <a href="4711.htm">4711</a> modification for multiple
ESNs requires changing the firmware. Techies may find the <a 
href="28c64.doc">map</a> of the prom useful.
The OKI 900 uses an 8051
microcontroller. If 
you want to use the data port on the bottom of the phone, you'll need to know
