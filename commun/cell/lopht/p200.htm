<h2>NEC P-200  & P-300 Programming</h2>
<p>
The P200( and 300)'s ESN and NAM can be programmed using the P3.exe program. However, a <a href="p2.zip">front end program</a> was designed to format 
the ESN. Using this program requies building a <a href="nec93cbl.txt">cable</a> that runs between the parallel port of a PC andthe P200's 
<a href="pinouts.nec">data port</a>. After changing the 
ESN, the program leaves the phone in <a href="testmode.txt">test mode</a>, from which you can program the <a href="nec01.txt">NAM</a>.

I have recently receiver some new software. I have not sorted it out and HTMLized the documents. Its from England, and mentions only the P3, I don't know how
much of this info is good for the P2. I will be changing this page shortly.
