NAM PROGRAMING:

1.  This unit requires a programing adaptor, part number EB-W0134, if you
    do not have one try one of the following:

If the phone has a transportable pack with a charged battery you can jump
pins 2 and 3 of the power connector with a paper clip or tweezers.  With
the transceiver right side up (rubber feet on the bottom) look at the power
connector, pin 2 is bottom right, and pin 3 is top center.  In the
following diagram the X marks the top of the connector where the plastic
clip on the power cord is:

                                 X
                               5 3 1
                               6 4 2

Ignore any numbers stamped on the connector and remember this shows the
power connector looking at the transceiver, or wire side of the power cord.

cap from the power cord and jump pins 2 and 3 as above.
