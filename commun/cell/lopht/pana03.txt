NAM PROGRAMING:

1.  This unit requires a programing adaptor, if you do not have one try
    one of the following:

    Jumper pins 3 and 25 of a standard power cable.

    If the phone has a transportable pack you can wire a 25 pin "D" socket
    to a 25 pin "D" plug, wire it straight through and jump pins 3 and 25.
    Connect this between the tranceiver and transportable pack.  A ribbon
    cable with crimp on "D" connectors makes a convienient adaptor.
