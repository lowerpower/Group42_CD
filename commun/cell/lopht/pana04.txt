NAM PROGRAMING:

1.  This unit requires a programing adaptor, part number EB-WWG1036A, if you
    do not have one try the following:

Locate the expansion connector on the bottom of the phone, remove the plastic
cover if installed.  Look at the connector with the small round antenna
connector to the right (keypad facing up).  There are four pins on each side
(top and bottom) of the connector, the left bottom pin and right bottom pin
must be shorted together.  Use a bent paper clip to do this, the phone will
wake up as soon as the clip makes contact.  The clip must be kept in place
during programing.  Looking at the bottom of the phone:
