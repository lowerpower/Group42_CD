 *BEFORE YOU BEGIN*

 Turn to the screen Make sure you have the information listed that you will
need to change, including:

                      Home Area I.D. (SIDH)
                      New Phone  Number (MIN)
                      System (A or B)
                      Paging Channel
                      Station Class Mark
                      Lock Code
                      and ESN

 Refer to specific programming instructions for additional information 
required for each particular cellular phone.

 There are two programs that contain information to program Panasonic cellular
phones. They are PAN, and also BEECH.
 Enter the PAN directory and type GO and you will see the menu titled
"Phone & Function Menu".
 You can get the cabling diagramto connect Panasonic phones to a computer for
programming from THE NEW YORK HACK EXCHANGE BBS at (718) 379-4702.

 Slect 1. " Program any Chip" to use the EEPROM programmer to program either
 16911 or 93C46 chips. Choice 2, "Panasonic D, E & F Series" is the screen
 actually used for programming. That program can be used to program NOKIA,or
 basically any phone that uses either the 93C46 or 16911 Serial EEPROM.

 PROGRAMMING THE PHONE:
 ----------------------
 After you have built the correct cabling to the phone and have a dedicated
power source to it, choose "2. Panasonic D, E & F Series" from the Phone &
Function Menu. 

 I recommend the following procedure.

1. Choose [F1] "READ CHIP" from the menu. After it has read the chip, do a
"Print Screen" or use a screen capture to save the original information in
case you need to put the phone back to its original readings. You might also
want to use [F4] to save the chip in order to have the original parameters
on file. Use a system that will allow you recognize the file name in the
event you need to reload the chip. 

2. After reading the chip, select [F7] to change the Electronic Serial Number
 (ESN). The next screen will prompt you for the ESN in either HEX or DECIMAL.
 Follow the prompts, selecting either H or D to enter the ESN. Remember to
 add the dashes if you select D for Decimal. After you have selected the
 correct parameters, select [F6] to program the chip.

3. When you are finished, simply select [Esc] to exit the programming phase.

instructions you can leave me mail on THE NEW YORK HACK EXCHANGE BBS or you
can find me floating around on the INTERNET...
