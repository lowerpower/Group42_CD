<h2>Panasonic EB 2601 PROM dump</h2><hr><pre>
Well guys, here you have the original EPROM code found inside one
Panasonic EB2601 cellular phone. I read it out of an spanish
phone but I guess its the same code used for the UK phones, as
all messages are in english... it should work under all ETACS
systems. Note this is of no use to countries under AMPS system
(like USA). The micro inside the phone is from mitsubishi, maybe
one of their MELPS microcontrollers... the code for this ones is
kinda hellish and theres not many tools around to play with this
code so... anyway if you find this useful... good for you!
