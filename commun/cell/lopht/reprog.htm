<h2>Motorola reprogramming with a cable</h2><p>
There is a continual battle between Motorola and the producers of 
reprogramming kits. These kits are part hardware and part software. The 
hardware is a cable that plugs into the parallel port on a computer and 
the data port on the phone. Different cable are used for the
<a href="bagcable.htm">bag phone</a>
(the transportable and mobile models; i.e. not handheld. A black, silver, 
or grey box.), the Micro-Tac (a.k.a. DPC-550) series <a 
href="flipfone.htm">flip
phone</a>, and the (classic, ultra-classic, model 8000) <a 
href="8000cble.doc">brick phone</a>.
Software packages are available to program phones with a firmware version 
number <a href="mot66.zip">less
than 9122</a> and other packages for firmware later than 9122, including <a 
href="mpc.zip">MPC</a>, <a
href="g2.zip">AMPS G2</a>,
<a href="ccc-mot3.zip">MOT3.2</a>, 
<a href="hth-v2.zip">HTH-v2</a> and <a href="mot911.zip">Motorola v.911</a> (HTH-V2 seems to be a 
clone of the Motorola program, but I prefer the original as HTH seems only to differ in that it 
thrashes the hard-drive around when loading and creates a directory called HTHRULEZ). An <a

transfer cable</a> copies the ESN from one cell phone to another without the use of a 
computer.

<h2>Reprogramming Hints</h2>
<p>
The original motorola reprogramming software (<a 
href="mot66.zip">version
6.6</a>) seems to not take the speed of the computer being used into 
account, therefore the timing can be off with systems considerably slower 
or faster than that which it was intended for. Use a system with a clock 
speed of between 10 Mhz and 20 Mhz for best results. An 80386sx at 16 Mhz 
seems to work pretty well, for example. Also, try switching I/O cards if 
you are having trouble. Another problem is the supply voltage. Use exactly 
the right voltage from a power supply hefty enough to give the phone all 
the current it requires, 3 amps or more. If you are having 'low battery' 
troubles while programming, unplug the handset if that is appropriate, as 
it uses additional power for the lights, etc. Also, the NAM programming 
feature of v6.6 seems buggy, just program the phone from test mode.<p> <p>
Some phones with newer software versions would seem to require new 
programming software, however, switching the PROM with an older version 
works, and you can even switch the PROM back once the phone has been 
programmed.<p>
