TECHNOPHONE PC 115

NOTES:  This unit has 8 NAMS
        The ESN prefix is 162 decimal & A5 hex.
        Technophone: 516-576-2000

This unit requires a security code to access programing mode, this code is
based on the unit's electronic serial number.  The hardware serial number
on the phone is the ESN suffix, if not already known.

Take the last six digits of the ESN, rearange and subtract from 999999 to
get the security code:

         Original sequence: 1 2 3 4 5 6

         New sequence:      6 2 4 5 1 3

For example if the ESN is 16200002164 take 002164 and rearange to get
401602.  This number is then subtracted from 999999 to get a security code
of 598397.

Alternativly call 1-800-251-1414, ask for technical support and give them
the ESN.  They will convert it for you!

1.  Turn phone on by pressing the ON/C key.

2.  Enter # S S S S S S # # 9 5 3 7 3 9 # MEM 9 9 MEM (where SSSSSS is the
    security code).

3.  Turn phone off by pressing the OFF key.

4.  Turn phone on again and it should display "Which NAM?", if it does not
    review the security code and try again.

5.  Enter the NAM you want to program, NAMs are numbered 0 through 7,
    followed by the * key.

6.  The first data entry will appear.

7.  Press the MEM key to store and increment the step number.

8.  Press SEND after step 07 when display reads "Save NAM?" to store the
    new data, phone will revert to "Which NAM?" at which point you can
    press END to complete and exit, or select another NAM.
