                                 TEST MODE
    
    
    Taken from the July 1993 Cellular Subscriber Technical Training Manual
    Item# 68P09300A60-C and the Curtis Namfax vol.4.  I believe this is a
    complete listing of all the commands that were ever possible.  This 
    includes old phones and the new ones.  If there are two entries for a
    particular number, the first one is the current command and the second
    is for older models.

NOTE: Not all commands work on all telephones.  If a command is not valid the
      display will show "ErrOr."  Not all numbers have been assigned.  Not all
      numbers have been listed here.  Some commands were intended only for
      Motorola factory applications.   (This is the disclaimer in the
      technical training manual.  I have included all of the other commands I 
      have discovered one way or another.  I do believe this is a complete list
      of the commands.)
    

Three test commands are significant for programming and registering the
the telephone for service:  see full descriptions under TEST MODE COMMANDS.

32#  Clears the telephone.  (Older Motorola allowed either three or fifteen 
changes in the MIN.  After that, the phone had to be sent to Motorola to reset 
the counter.  This is the command they use.) 

38#  Displays the ESN

55#  This is the TEST MODE PROGRAMMING (as described below).


                          TEST MODE COMMANDS:


#    Enter Test Command Mode

00#  no function

01#  Restart (Re-enter DC power start-up routine.)  On TDMA telephones, this
     command has the same effect as pressing the PWR button.

02#  Display Current Telephone Status (This is a non-altering version of the
     STATUS DISPLAY.  On a 14 character display, all the information is shown.
     On a 7 character display only the information on the second line of a 14
     character display is shown.  On a 10 character display, all the 
     information on the second line of a 14 charcter display plus the last 
     three characters of the first line are shown.)

     STATUS DISPLAY, ALTERNATES BETWEEN:
     
     AAA BBB   AAA = Channel Number (decimal)    BBB = RSSI reading for channel
     CDEFGHI   are as follows:

     C = SAT frequency (0=5970, 1=6000, 2=6030, 3=no channel lock)
     D = Carrier (0=off, 1=on)
     E = Signalling tone (0=off, 1=on)
     F = Power attenuation level (0 through 7)
     G = Channel mode (0=voice channel, 1=control channel)
     H = Receive audio mute (0=unmuted, 1=muted)
     I = Transmit audio mute (0=unmuted, 1=muted)

     Press * to hold display and # to end.

03#  Reset Autonomous Timer.   This command results in the reset of the 
     autonomous timer but does not provide any test function on these models.

04#  Initializes Telephone to Standard Default Conditions:
     Carrier Off, Power Level 0, Receiver Audio Muted, Transmit Audio Muted,
     Signalling Tone Off, SAT Off, Resetting of Watch-Dog Timer Enabled, 
     DTMF and Audio Tones Off, Audio Path Set to Speaker

05#  TX Carrier On (Key Transmitter)

06#  TX Carrier Off

07#  RX Audio Off (Mute Receiver Audio)

08#  RX Audio On (Unmute Receiver Audio)

09#  TX Audio Off

10#  TX Audio On

11(Ch.No.)# Set Tranceiver to Channel xxxx (Receive and Transmit in Decimal;
            accepts 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits)

12x# Set Power Step to x; (0,1-7) 0=Maximum Power (3 Watts) 7=Minimum Power Out

13#  Power Off (Shuts off the radio)

14#  10 kHz Signalling Tone On

15#  10 kHz Signalling Tone Off

16#  Setup  (Transmits a five word RECC message; each of the five words will 
     be "FF00AA55CC33."  Transmitter de-keys at the end of the message.)

17#  Voice  (Transmits a two word REVC message; each of the two words will be
     "FF00AA55CC33."  Transmitter de-keys at the end of the message.)

18#  C-Scan  (Allows for entry of as many as 5 negative SID's for each NAM.)

     Newer Motorola phones are equipped with a feature called C-Scan, this is 
     an option along with the standard A/B system selections.  C-Scan allows 
     the phone to be programed with up to five inhibited system ID's per NAM.  
     This is designed to prevent the phone from roaming onto specified non-home
     systems and therefore reduce "accidental" roaming fees.

     1.  C-Scan can only be programed from test mode, power phone up with the
         relevant test mode contact grounded (see above).

     2.  Press # to access test mode.

     3.  Press 18#, the phone will display "0    40000".

     4.  Enter the first inhibited system ID and press *.

     Continue to enter additional system ID's if required.  After the 5th entry
     the phone will display "N2". Press * to continue and add system ID's for
     NAM 2 as required.

     5.  If an incorrect entry is made (outside the range of 00000-32767) the
         display will not advance, press CLR and re-enter.  Use a setting of
         40000 for any un-needed locations.

     6.  When the last entry has been made press * to store and press # to
exit,
         turn off power.

     or
     
     [**Phones without the C-Scan option used this command to SEND NAM.**]

18#  SEND NAM.  Display shows AA BB.  Where AA=Address and BB=Data.  Displays  

     the contents of the NAM, one address at a time, advanced by pressing the
     * key.  The following data is contained in NAM.  The test is exited by
     depressing the # key.
     SIDH                 Sec. Code

     ACCOLC               CHKSUM       GIM

19#  Display Software Version Number  (4 digits displayed as year and week)

NOTE:  Entering commands 20# through 23# or 27# causes the tranceiver to begin
       a counting sequence or continous transmission as described below.  In
       order to exit from the commands to enter another test command, the # 
       key must be depressed; all other key depressions are ignored.

20#  Receive control channel messages counting correctable and uncorrectable
     errors.  When the command starts, the number of the command will be 
     displayed in the upper-right corner of the display.  Entering a # key
     will terminate the command and display two three-digit numbers in the 
     display.  The first number is the number of correctable errors and the
     second is the uncorrectable errors.

21#  Received voice channel messages counting correctable and uncorrectable
     errors.  When the command starts, the number of the command will be 
     displayed in the upper right-hand corner of the display.  Entering a # 
     key terminates the command and will display two three-digit numbers in 
     display.  The first is the number of correctable errors and the second 
     is the uncorrectable errors.

22#  Receive control channel messages counting word sync sequence.  When the
     command starts, the number of the command will be displayed in the upper
     right-hand corner of the display.  Entering a # key will terminate the
     command and display the number of word sync sequences in the display.

23#  Receive voice channel messages counting word sync sequences.  When the
     command starts, the number of the command will be displayed in the upper
     right-hand corner of the display.  Entering a # key will terminate the 
     command and display the number of word sync sequences in the display.

                                                x=2, SAT=6030HZ

26#  SAT Off

27#  Transmit Data  (Transmits continuous control channel data.  All words 
     will be "FF00AA55CC33."  When the command starts, '27' will be displayed
     in the right side of the display.  Entering a # key will terminate the
     command.  The transmitter de-keys when finished.)

28#  Activate the high tone (1150 Hz +/- 55 Hz)

29#  De-activate the high tone

30#  Activate the low tone (770 Hz +/- 40 Hz)

31#  De-activate the low tone

32#  Clear (Sets non-volatile memory to zeroes or factory default.  This 
     command will affect all counters, all repertory memory including the last
     number called stack, and all user programmable features including the
     setting of System Registration.  It does not affect the ESN, NAM, phasing
     data, or lock code.  This takes a minute or so.  DO NOT TURN OFF THE 
     TELEPHONE WHILE THIS IS SHOWING '32' ON THE DISPLAY.  WAIT UNTIL THE 
     NORMAL SERVICE LEVEL DISPLAY RESUMES!)

55#  Display/Program N.A.M. (Test Mode Programming)

     TEST MODE PROGRAMING:

     Assuming you have completed one of the above steps correctly the phone
     will wake up in test mode when you turn the power on.  When you first
     access test mode the phone's display will alternate between various status
     information that includes the received signal strength and channel number.
     The phone will operate normally in this mode.  You can now access Service
     Mode by pressing the # key, the display will clear and a ' will appear.
     Use the following procedure to program the phone:

     1.  Enter 55# to access programing mode.

     2.  The * key advances to the next step.  (NOTE that test mode programing
         does NOT have step numbers, each time you press the * key the phone 
         will display the next data entry).

     3.  The CLR key will revert the display to the previously stored data.

     4.  The # key aborts programing at any time.

     5.  To complete programing you must scroll through ALL entries until a '
         appears in the display.

     6.  Note that some entries contain more digits than can be displayed by
the
         phone, in this case only the last part of the data can be seen.

     Steps 01 through 06 and 12 will repeat for NAM 2 if the second phone 
     number bit has been enabled in step 11.

     NOTES:

     Take care with Motorola's use of "0" and "1".  Some options use "0" to
     enable, some use "1".

     These are eight digit binary fields used to select the following options:

     1.  (step 02 above, suggested entry is: 11101001 for "A" system, 10101001
         for "B" sys)

         Digit 5: Single system scan, 1 to enable (scan A or B system only,
                  determined by bit 2 of step 02. Set to "0" to allow user the
                  option).
         Digit 6: Super speed dial, 1 to enable (pressing N, or NN SND will 
                  dial the number stored in memory location NN).

                  set long distance/memory access dialing restrictions).
         Digit 8: Lock function, 0 to enable (allows user to lock/un-lock the
                  phone, if this is set to 1 the phone can not be locked).

     3.  (step 11 above, suggested entry is: 00000000)

Notes:  There are several numbers that say "no function" next to their entry.
        In the technical manual, those numbers APPEAR to have no function.  It 
        is very possible that they DO IN FACT have a function.  As far as I 
        know, using the information provided by the technical manual, I know 
        of no functions for these numbers.  But at the top you'll notice in the
        disclaimer that NOT ALL FUNCTIONS ARE LISTED HERE.  That leaves open a
        possibility of others.  Try these numbers and you may get lucky (or you
        may wipe some vital information...who knows?).  I am in fact almost 
        certain that it is possible to change the ESN via the handset.  It is 
        just a matter of finding the correct combination of commands.  You can 
        bet that won't be easy, but it can't stay a secret forever though!

For more information, call Motorola and order part# 68-093-00a60.  This is a 
cellular service manual that's used in their cellular service classes that 
sells for $30.  Ask for the Order Fulfillment department when ordering.  This 
manual tells it all!  An absolute must have for Motorola users.
