NOTES:  This unit has 8 NAMS
        The ESN prefix is 162 decimal & A5 hex.
        Walker: 1-800-251-1414

This unit is basically a Technophone PC 105, it can only be handset
programed if the firmware has been updated.  If you can not access
programing mode call Walker/Technophone at the number above for upgrade
information.

This unit requires a security code to access programing mode, this code is
based on the unit's electronic serial number.  The hardware serial number
on the phone is the ESN suffix, if not already known.

Take the last six digits of the ESN, rearange and subtract from 999999 to
get the security code:

         Original sequence: 1 2 3 4 5 6

         New sequence:      6 2 4 5 1 3

For example if the ESN is 16200002164 take 002164 and rearange to get
401602.  This number is then subtracted from 999999 to get a security code
of 598397.

Alternativly call 1-800-251-1414, ask for technical support and give them
the ESN.  They will convert it for you!
