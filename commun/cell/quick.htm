<h3>The cells</h3>

In the UK there are 2 main cellular networks, there are others but the ones 
we discuss here are the analogue services provided by Vodafone
and Cellnet
Both these networks operate on exactly the same technical sprecification,
ie. there is no difference between the phones. Each network has towers all 
over the country known as cell-sites. A cell site is basically a 16 channel
TX/RX connected to the network nerve center. Each tower usually covers an area
of a few miles this area is called a cell.
<br><br>
Each tower constantly transmits a stream of data on one fixed channel, this 
is known as the Forward Control Channel. This channel is the one the mobile
fones are always listening to when in standby. The network in theory always
knows which cell contains which fones at any particular time, this is because 
when a mobile is switched on it transmits a data burst containing the phones
identity. This data is picked up by a tower (or maybe more than one tower) 
and that phone is then registered in that cell. The phones also retransmit 
this data every 10 or so seconds. This data burst is transmitted by the mobile
 45mhz below the towers tranmit FCC frequency, this is called the Reverse Control Channel.

<h3>What happens when you ring a mobile number.</h3>  

Since the network already knows where a particular fone is when someone 
rings that number the cell tower pages the phone and allocates it free
TX and RX channels known as the Voice channels. The phone then switches 
to these new channels and begins to ring, when the user answers the 
conversation takes place on the same channels. The mobiles transmit channel is 
always 45mhz below the RX channel. If the user is travelling at the time 
his signal will obviosly drop the further away he moves from a tower. 
When this happens the network senses that the signal is getting to weak 
and allocates a another channel on a nearer tower. This is done by the 
tower transmitting a short data burst on the RX voice channel telling the
fone which channel to jump to, known as "Hand Off". If when you ring a 
mobile fone that has not been registerd recently in a cell the network asks 
all the towers in the country to try and find the fone, this is called 
paging. Basically the tower sends out a signal to force the fone to 
register onto the network. Once this happens the call gets placed. If the 
the fone cannot be found, either because the fone is switched off (dead battery)
or in a area where the coverage is too low, you get a message telling you 
that mobile is switched off and to try later.

<h3>What happens when a Mobile rings out.</h3>

When the mobile user dials out a data burst is transmit on the Reverse Control
Channel to the Tower. This data burst contains the phones identity and the 
number being dialled. Once the network has verified that the Identity is 
valid the voice channels are allocated and the call goes through. If the 
Identity of the fone is dodgy probaly because of unpaid bills the network cuts you
off straight away, sometimes the voice channels get allocated so the network 
can tell you to go away and contact your service provider after this you 
get cut off.

<h3>So what does the Identity of a fone consist of.</h3>

This is where the phreakin comes in. Each phone has a unique Electronic Serial
Number (ESN for short) this is burned into some permanent memory in the fone 
at the factory, and it is unchangeable (err... well supposed to be). The other 
stuff is the  MIN number which is basically the actual fones telephone number. 
Actually with the MIN the first 4 digits are replaced by 4 other digits ie.
0831-123456 becomes 2344-123456 I don't quite know why this is done, there is
no mathamatical relationship between the numbers you will need a 
lookup table. 
There are other bits that get transmitted to the tower but to keep it 
simple we'll ignore them for the time being. The MIN number along with a
 few other parameters is programmed by the dealer from where you puchased your fone. 
This is called the NAM programing short for Numerical Access Module basically 
this is the permament memory in the fone that contains along with the MIN, 
other bits of data to tell the fone which Network it is connected to so it 
can tune in to the correct towers, Vodafone or Cellnet. The Lock password 
etc. are also stored in the NAM.

<h3>Err, if the ESN is permanent how the hell is Cloning possible?</h3>

Basically the ESN can be changed with the right knowledge and tools. So if 
you wanted an extension phone this should be easy to do. I'm sure that 
manufacturers could make it exteamly difficult for this type of reprogramming 
or chipping but its not the case. A lot of the newer fones are indeed 
almost un-chippable but theres always a bright spark who figures it out. 
The older the fone the more likely that it can be chipped, the easiest and 
most popular fones for this purpose have got to be the Motorolas. The fones 
are usually connected to a PC via some homemade lead/interface and 3rd party 
software used to actually read and alter the ESN/NAM. <br><br>

<h3>Ok how did they clone Jack blogg's fone number then.</h3>

Because of the grey area about discussing such things, I will only go into this
very vagely. You will be able get more info from some of the links. Basically 
the "pirates" listen to the reverse control channels, when a phone registers 
onto the network it transmits its ESN/MIN pair which is picked up by the 
tower and anyone else with the right gear. Talk about crap security!!! IN 
phreaker terminology this is known as snarfing or grabbing pairz. I strongly 
disuade any of you from trying this as it is illegal probably even more illegal
to make call's using some elses ESN/MIN pair. <br>
If someone manages to get your pair and tots up huge bills on your account, 
your service provider usually ammends your bill to your monthly average. Your
existing ESN is killed off. If they can't program a new ESN with your  
fone number into your existing fone, you are usually issued a different fone.
