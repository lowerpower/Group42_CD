The following information was gathered from various sources and is not meant 
to be a technical treatise on the cellular network.  There are plenty of 
other files out there on the subject.  This file specifically deals with the
processes involved in modifying cellulars.  I put together this file because
I have not seen one that actually tells how to do this.  When some of you  
start reading this you might say to yourselves "Hey, some of this is almost
word for word from Brian Oblivion's article (incidently, one of the best
I have seen on the subject) in Phrack #38 or so and so's article in so and so 
magazine".  Well, not to discount anyone who has written anything on cellular 
phones, but all the information in this file was purchased by me from various 
ads in the back of various radio and communications magazines.  I make no 
pretense as to where the original source of this material comes from.  In 
fact,  most of the t-files I have seen contain some of the Consumertronics 
info. word for word, and the writers try and claim it as their own.  Or maybe 
vice versa.  I make no claim to have written this manual (but beleive me 
after putting this together I could).  The only thing I have done is spent 
many hours compiling what I believe to be a very good file on the subject.
