<h3>Who is GRAPES?</h3>

 <p>We're  the <b>G</b>eorgia<b> R</b>adio <b>A</b>mateur<b>
P</b>acket<b> E</b>nthusiasts<b> S</b>ociety...<i> what a mouth
full...eh?</i> an organization of volunteer amateur radio
operators,  representing Member LAN's from across the State of
Georgia.  We've provided documentation and distribution of the
WA4DSY 56KB RF Modem Kits since 1987.   Our charter is to
promote High-Speed Amateur Networking throughout Georgia and to
provide a forum  for building a Southeastern Regional Network
with neighboring st

ate-wide packet organizations ( ALANET, TENNET, etc.).



<h3>*** The NEW WA4DSY 56KB RF Modem *** </h3>

<p>Dale Heatherington WA4DSY, has completely redesigned the 56KB
modem and produced one  that promises to revolutionize amateur
packet networking.  The first alpha units were demo'd as the RF
packet link between a web server and a client station at the
Atlanta Hamfest in July 1995.  Beta testing will begin soon in
the Atlanta area and run for a few months before the new modems
become available as off the shelf, commercially assembled and
tested units.
