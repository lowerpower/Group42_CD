<H2>9600 bps Modems</H2>
The K9NG modem was available for a number of years as a kit from 
TAPR.  It set the "standard" for 9600 bps packet operation, but it 
has now been replaced by the G3RUH and new TAPR designs.  Among the 
improvements provided by the newer designs is full-duplex capability. 
Even though full-duplex is not often used on the air, this is a great convenience 
for doing loop back testing of the modem.  If you still have a K9NG 
modem lying around, though, don't hesitate to try it.
<P>
The G3RUH modem is available from several sources:

</DT>
<DD>The new design has all of the features of the G3RUH, plus a few 
enhancements.  It is attractive for repeater use, since it includes 
provision on the board for bit regeneration/FIFO buffering ($15 extra 
for the parts).  The first rev of the board in 1992 had a few problems, 
and some mods were needed for best performance.  A new rev which 
incorporates the fixes became available in early 1993.  TAPR members 
get a 10% discount on purchases.

</DD></DL><P>The G3RUH and TAPR modems can plug directly into a TNC modem disconnect 
header as a daughter board, or be connected externally via a ribbon 
cable.
</P><P></P><H2>Data Interfaces for 9600 bps</H2>
For 9600 bps, the usual interface is a TNC.  Most of the major packet
manufacturers offer a dual-port 1200/9600 bps TNC. If you don't already 
have a TNC, it's worth considering a PC bus interface card like the 
PI2 or the PackeTwin.  They are a better investment since they will
not become obsolete if you upgrade to higher speeds than 9600.  In 
fact, many people have reported results with TNCs that were much 
less than theoretical maximums, even at 9600 bps.  The faster the 
TNC clock rate the better: 4.9 MHz should be considered an absolute 
minimum.  The serial connection to the PC is a limiting factor; even if it
run at fairly high speed (i.e., 19.2 or 38.4 kbps), the throughput will be
significantly lower than with one of the bus interface cards.
<P></P><DL>
<DT><A HREF="#pwg">Ottawa PI2 card</A> ($125 plus shipping).
</DT>
<DD>It provides a DMA port which handles 56 kbps with ease, even with 
a 4.77 MHz XT-class machine.  All you need to add is the cable to 
the modem.  The main limitation of the card is that it does not support 
full-duplex operation, but full-duplex operation is rare (especially 
amongst end users).  The PI2 also has a low-speed port and can be 
populated with an on-board 1200 bps modem (kit available for $30). 
The board can be used with any DOS version of KA9Q NOS, or with Linux.

full-duplex operation.  The Kantronics 9600 bps modem can be piggybacked 
on the card.

</DL><P></P><H2>Radios for 9600 bps</H2>

<P>A standard NBFM radio is typically used.  To interface to the 
modem, the radio must have a direct FSK modulator, discriminator 
output, an IF with sufficient bandwidth and reasonable phase characteristics, 
and fast t/r switching.  Some radios are usable with just a few modifications 
to bring out the required signals, others may need more extensive 
mods such as adding a varactor FM modulator, and still others are 
almost completely unusable due to their IF characteristics or slow 
t/r switching.  There are a few radios designed specifically for 
digital service which require no mods:
</P><P></P><H3>2m:</H3>

<DT><A HREF="#alinco">Alinco</A> <STRONG>DR-1200TH2</STRONG> (approx. $300).
</DT>
<DD>This is a version of the DR-1200T 
25W synthesized radio which has been modified for 9600 bps operation.
It is reputed to be a mediocre performer, due to slow turnaround time.

</DT>
<DD>2W output, one channel, crystal controlled (430-450 MHz).  Available 
directly from Tekk, and in packages from PacComm and other sources.
Tekk has a more expensive model called the KS960 (in a larger, chrome
case) which apparently does not work as well at 9600 bps as the KS900L,
and thus should be avoided.
</DD>
PacComm is another source of the Tekk radios, and they
also sell modified versions with new filters installed (e.g., KS-900L-D96
for 9600 bps, $230) which they say provide improved performance. The filter
upgrade kits are also sold separately ($35).

</DD>
</DL><P>A large number of amateur VHF and UHF transceivers have been successfully 
used for 9600 bps work.  Many commercial FM radios are also suitable; 
ironically, the IF filters in these radios are typically 'better' 
(narrower bandwidth, steeper skirts) than in amateur-grade equipment, 
which leads to inferior performance at 9600 bps (on the other hand, 
they also tend to have superior intermod immunity compared to amateur 
rigs). The IF stages of most receivers can be broadbanded successfully, 
but the degree of difficulty and expense involved varies considerably.
</P><P></P><P>A good source of information on radio interfacing and other topics 
related to 9600 bps operation is the <A HREF="ftp://hydra.carleton.ca/pub/hamradio/packet/96man2x0.txt">9600 Baud Packet Handbook</A> 
by <B>Mike Curtis, WD6EHR</B>.  Hard copies are distributed with 
the TAPR modem, and it can also be found in electronic form on some 
BBS's and on the Internet. The latest version seems to 2.0 (June 94).
<P>
Tests of a  number of recent "9600 ready" synthesized radios were 
reported in the May 1995 issue of <strong>QST</strong>. Most were poor
performers. The only two which delivered acceptable 9600 bps performance
were the Icom IC-820H 2m/70cm multimode and the Azden PCS-9600D 70cm
voice/data transceiver. Both are very expensive, however. Another expensive
radio which performs well at 9600 bps is the Kenwood TM-255A 2m multimode
tranceiver (QST, June 1995).</P>
<H2>Summary: 9600 bps</H2>
The cost of getting something working at 9600 bps is highly variable. 
If you already had a TNC and a suitable radio plus antenna, it could 
be as little as $80 or so (TAPR modem).  On the other hand, you can 
get a "plug 'n play" package such as the IPR-NB96 from PacComm, 
for about $500 - just add an antenna.  You should seriously 
question spending this kind of money to get 9600 bps, when you could 
put together a 56 kbps setup for not much more money (but, admittedly, 
considerably more effort!).
<P>
<HR>
<P></P><P></P><H1>Equipment for 19.2 kbps</H1>

<P>Until recently, operation at 19.2 kbps had not received much attention. 
 A major reason for this is that binary FSK at 19.2 kbps cannot be 
accommodated by the IF stages of NBFM receivers, nor is it compatible 
with the 20 or 25 kHz channel spacing used for FM in the amateur 
VHF/UHF bands. On the other hand, it makes relatively poor use of 
the 100 kHz channels typically allocated for 'wideband' digital modes. 
 However, interest in 19.2 kbps operation has been spurred by the 
appearance of the Kantronics D4-10 radio.  Since it contains a varactor 
modulator, plus a data slicer following the discriminator, it can 
be operated in 'raw FSK' mode at 19.2 kbps without additional modem 
hardware.  All that is needed in addition to the radio is the computer 
interface.  A 'souped-up' TNC might work fairly well, but one of 
the PC DMA interface boards (or maybe a DataEngine) would be better. 
 Running 'modemless' FSK entails some loss of performance, most notably 
from the lack of data scrambling, which results in more jitter in 
the recovered clock signal and thus higher bit error rates.
</P><P></P><P><A HREF="#kan">Kantronics</A> also offers a 19.2 kbps modem, similar to the DE9600. 
The performance difference between the 'barebones' D4-10 radios 
and that which you could realize with the more sophisticated modem 
has not, to my knowledge, been quantified.  The <A HREF="#grapes">GRAPES</A> modem (see 
below) could also be run at 19.2 kbps, but it would not be compatible 
with the Kantronics equipment (and why would you want to throttle 
back a modem that can do 56 kbps and more, to only 19.2?).
</P><P></P><P>Some experiences with using the D4-10's at 19.2 kbps, using
Ottawa PI cards and DataEngines as interfaces, appear in an article by <B>John 
Ackermann, AG9V</B> in the <EM>11th ARRL Computer Networking Conference 
Proceedings</EM> (available from <A HREF="#tapr">TAPR</A>).
<P>
<A HREF="#pac">PacComm</A> offers Tekk radios which have been modified for
19.2 kbps operation (<STRONG>KS-900L-D192</STRONG>, $235).  The filter upgrade kits are also
sold separately ($39).

<H2>56 kbps Modem</H2>
<P><A HREF="#grapes">GRAPES</A> (WA4DSY) modem, $250 in kit form.  You also need to provide 
a box for it, plus a few interconnecting cables and connectors.  
It requires +/-5V power (about 0.5A @ +5V, 0.1A @ -5V).  This is 
an RF modem with input and output (about 1 mW) in the 28-30 MHz band, 
designed for use in the bands above 220 MHz (occupied bandwidth is 
about 70 kHz at 56 kbps), using standard receive and transmit converters. 
The receive and transmit portions of the modem are separately crystal-controlled
, and it can run full-duplex.  It is not limited to 56 kbps - with 
suitable modifications, it can be made to work at 128 kbps or more.
</P><P>
Dale Heatherington WA4DSY has come up with a complete redesign of his modem,
substantially reducing the parts count and size (now fits on one board
instead of three). The new modem is fully compatible with the old one at
56 kbps, but it will not work at other bit rates. The big news is that it
will be sold in assembled and tested form by <A HREF="#pac">PacComm</A>.
Availability is said to be "late 1995", and the price has been announced
as $349.

<DT><A HREF="#kan">Kantronics DataEngine </A>(~$350?).
</DT>
<DD>This is essentially a higher-speed TNC with two HDLC ports that 
can reportedly run at 56 kbps, and an RS-232 port that can run at 
up to 19.2 kbps.  The standard firmware is KA-Node or G8BPQ, but 
there is now also a port of JNOS (JNOS40) by WG7J available.  The 
DE appears to be more useful as a small standalone packet switch 
than as an interface for end users.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Gracilis PackeTen</STRONG> ($1595?) from <A HREF="#pac">PacComm</A>.
</DT>
<DD>This is a full-blown packet switch that runs a custom version 
of KA9Q NOS.  It is available in both standalone and PC bus versions. 
 This is the Rolls Royce of packet switch hardware.  The name is 
a bit of a misnomer, since one PackeTen provides five ports - you 
must add another one to get ten ports.  All of the ports will handle 
synchronous or asynchronous rates of 1200 to 19200 bps, and three 
of them will do synchronous rates up to T1 or more.
<P>
PacComm has also announced that they are working on a scaled-down
version of the PackeTen (PackeTen Junior?) which will run the same
code as the big one and have two RF ports and one serial port... in
other words, like the DataEngine, only better. :-) According to PacComm,
it will be "available mid-winter at a price well below that of the
PackeTen".
</DD>
</DL><P></P><H2>RF Equipment for 56 kbps</H2>
The RF equipment required depends on whether the links are half- 
or full-duplex.  There are three basic configurations in use:
<P></P><DL>
<DT>(1) Half-duplex point-to-point links
</DT>
<DD>An example is the Georgia backbone network.  The usual RF equipment 
is a Microwave Modules (220, 430 MHz) or Sinclabs (220 MHz) transverter.
</DD>
<DT>(2) Full-duplex point-to-point links
</DT>
<DD>Full duplex operation is significantly more complicated, but it 
is also highly desirable if you want to maximize the throughput of 
a backbone link.  The GRAPES modem is inherently full-duplex, so 
it is only necessary to provide separate RF up- and down-converters. 
 The two channels may be in-band or cross-band, using either separate 
antennas or duplexers.  The only full-duplex point-to-point link 
I'm aware of is in Chicago - it uses PackeTen switches and operates 
in-band in the 70 cm band.
</DD>
<DT>(3) Multiple-access networks with full-duplex repeater
</DT>
<DD>In this case, an in-band or cross-band 56 kbps repeater provides 
hidden transmitter-free access to a channel (or rather, a pair of 
channels) by multiple 56 kbps stations.  This might just be a LAN 
for the power users, but it also is an attractive means of linking 
a number of network nodes together, with less complexity than multiple 
point-to-point links. See the <EM>10th ARRL Computer Networking Conference 
proceedings</EM> (available from <A HREF="#tapr">TAPR</A>)for more details. As in the preceding case, separate 
receive and transmit converters are used, usually with separate antennas 
(in principle, a transverter with "split" frequency operation could 
be used, but such things are hard to come by). The stations in this 
network do not require full-duplex computer interfaces, but since 
the RF portions have full-duplex capability, it allows smaller txdelays 
to be used than in the half-duplex case.  It also allows users to 
observe the quality of their signals coming back from the repeater.
</DD>
</DL><P>The first 56 kbps full-duplex repeater went on the air in 
Ottawa
in January 1990.  The repeater is cross-band (220.55 MHz in, 433.55 
MHz out), so users must up-convert the modem's 28-30 MHz IF output 
to 220 MHz, and down-convert 432 MHz to the 28-30 MHz IF input.
The new WA4DSY modem will have the bit-regenerator repeater capability
built-in.

<P>The receive converters have very broad front ends, and some additional 
<B>bandpass filtering</B> will often be needed.  A single <B>cavity</B> 
(or <B>helical resonator front-end filter</B>, in the case of separate 
receive converters) should do the trick in most cases.  There is 
also a design available for a home-brew
<A HREF="ftp://hydra.carleton.ca/pub/hamradio/packet/modems/56kbfltr.txt"> 28-30 MHz bandpass filter</A> 
for the modem front end.  This might eliminate the need for a front-end 
filter, but it depends on your receiving environment.
</P><P></P><H2>56 kbps Summary</H2>
The cost of a 56 kbps station is a bit hard to pin down, given all 
the variables.  As an example, we'll consider a station for the 
Ottawa
56kb LAN.  The modem kit and a PI2 card will set you back about
$375.  The rest depends on the choice of rf stuff.  The total will 
vary from about $500 to $800.  The "low road" is using the Hamtronics 
kits and scrounging up things such as boxes for them and the modem, 
home brewing the antennas, etc.  The "high road" is buying higher-quality 
assembled and tested gear, such as the Sinclabs transverter and the 
MM receive converter.  If you can find some good used gear, the total 
should be closer to $650.  Getting on 56 kbps is certainly a more 
challenging project than plug 'n play 9600, but the rewards are greater 
too.

<H1>The Packet Frontier: Equipment for Speeds Greater than 56 kbps</H1>

<P>The following is a very rough first cut at summarizing the current 
situation for packet at speeds greater than 56 kbps.  Commercial 
availability of radio and modem equipment for these speeds is nil, 
so this is really the domain of the true experimenter!
</P><P></P><H2>Data Interface</H2>
There is, at least, some hardware that can sink/source data at these 
rates:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#pwg">Ottawa PI2</A> card: up to 500 kbps, maybe more
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Gracilis PackeTwin</STRONG>: up to 1 Mbps claimed
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Gracilis PackeTen</STRONG>: up to 4 Mbps (aggregate)
</LI>

</UL><H2>RF Hardware for &gt;56 kbps</H2>

<H3>GRAPES Modem</H3>

<P>The original <A HREF="#grapes">GRAPES Modem</A> (not the new 1995 design)
can run at higher speeds than 56 kbps.  In his 
1987 CNC article, Dale WA4DSY mentions rates up to 120 kbps.  I've 
run a pair of modems back-to-back at 125 kbps.  Most of the changes 
are straightforward (e.g., changing the baud rate generator crystal 
from 3.579 MHz to 8 MHz), but there are two problem areas.  Standard 
555 timer chips won't work reliably above 100 kHz, so the receiver 
clock recovery PLL circuit needs more than just a resistor or capacitor 
change.  Replacement of the 555 with a TI TLC555 does the trick. 
 The other problem is the 455 kHz IF filter: it can be retuned so 
that the modem works at 125 kbps, but the eye pattern isn't very 
satisfactory.  A new filter design will be needed for decent on-the-air 
results.
</P><P></P><H3>N6GN 250-500 kbps RF Modem</H3>

<P>Glenn Elmore N6GN (<I>glenne@sr.hp.com</I>) has designed an RF 
modem for the 902 MHz band which is intended for use at rates in 
the 250 to 500 kbps range.  The modem is crystal-controlled, has 
about 12W output, and extremely fast turnaround time.  Note that 
this is an FSK modem, and is not at all similar to the spread spectrum 
"wireless ethernet" systems which are available for this band.  Glenn 
is currently running some of these units at 230.4 kbps, using <A HREF="#pwg">
Ottawa PI2</A> cards. No PC boards or construction plans are available at the 
moment.  Units for 1.2 GHz have been mentioned, but I'm not sure 
if they exist.  For more info on this work and the 10 GHz equipment described 
in the next section, check out Glenn's

<P>Glenn Elmore and friends (Kevin Rowett N6RCE, Bdale Garbee N3EUA, 
etc) have also designed an X-band (10 GHz) full-duplex packet data 
link using inexpensive gunnplexor modules that runs at a nominal 
2 Mbps rate.  Details can be found in recent editions of the ARRL 
Handbook.  I haven't heard of any such systems actually being put 
into service yet, but there is a source for the PC boards:

Status: RO
</PRE>

<PRE>Receiver boards are now (at last!) available for the n6gn designed, 
2 MBPS, 10 GHz microwave link as described in the ARRL Handbook and 
other places.  You'll still need to make the 1st IF board yourself, 
but trust me, that's easy.  I didn't believe Glenn at first, just 
follow the procedure in the article and it works!
</PRE>

<PRE>The receiver board is 4-3/4 x 5-3/4", double sided, and drilled, 
*but not plated through* (hence you'll have to solder top and bottom 
leads in some cases).  This shouldn't be a big problem because there 
are no signal traces on the component side--it's all ground plane.
</PRE>

<PRE>Folks who helped make these boards available (though they may not 
all want to admit it :-) are Glenn Elmore n6gn (of course), John 
Conner wd0fhg, Ron Atkinson n8fow, Fred Reimers kf9gx, Bdale Garbee 
n3eua, and Jon Bloom ke3z.

<H3>T1 Modem</H3>
<P>Clint Turner KA7OEI (<I>ka7oei@uugate.wa7slg.ampr.org</I>) has 
designed a T1 rate (1.536 Mbps) modem, intended for use in the packet 
backbone network in Utah.  This modem is designed for full-duplex operation
and produces and demodulates a baseband-type signal.  It was designed for
FM transmitter/receiver systems with a baseband bandwidth of at least
1.5 MHz.
