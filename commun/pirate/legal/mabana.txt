STATEMENT OF FACTS
	Mbanna Kantako, a legally blind African American citizen of 
the United States, is a resident of the John Hay Homes public 
housing project in Springfield, Illinois.  On November 23, 1988, 
he began broadcasting community-oriented radio programs over a 
one-watt FM radio station from his apartment with the aid of two 
"black boxes" which he purchased from a catalogue for $600.00.  
The station was initially named "WTRA."  The name was 
subsequently changed to "Zoom Black Magic" radio, and changed 
again to "Black Liberation Radio" following events outlined in 
this brief.

	WTRA was founded following Kantako's introduction to Mike 
Townsend, professor of social work at nearby Sangamon State 
University in the summer of 1985.  The two met at a meeting 
addressing issues facing the tenant's Residents Council within 
the John Hay Homes.  Townsend's presentation led to the 
subsequent formation of an organization called the Tenants Rights 
Association (TRA).  This community group was initially successful 
in persuading the Springfield School Department to provide 
neccessary bus service to school children living in the John Hay 
Homes.  However, a subsequent voting rights dispute convinced 
Kantako that the commercial broadcast media of Springfield were 
unable to reach that city's minority community.  Kantako realized 
that the local media were unresponsive to cultural, political and 
news issues in the black community, and felt a need to respond.  

	Rather than starting a local newspaper, Kantako's blindness 
and past experience as a disk jockey convinced him that he should 
start a radio station.  Kantako believed that newspapers are 
rapidly becoming an obsolete medium of communications.  In 
addition, Kantako felt that a radio station was more likely to 
reach African American men, who suffer a disproportionately low 
literacy rate.   However, Kantako never obtained a broadcasting 
license since no FCC licensing provision exists for stations 
operating at less than one hundred watts.  The estimated start-up 
cost of a one-hundred watt station is in excess of $50,000.  
Mbanna Kantako, a 32 year old low-income public housing resident 
could not afford the prohibitive cost of such a venture.   

	WTRA began broadcasting in November 1988 at 107.1 MHz.  
Kantako's broadcasts could be received within a mile and a half 
of the transmitter by a population of approximately 2,0000 
people, with 1,500 living in the John Hay Homes of Springfield, 
Illinois.  The population of the John Hay Homes is 98% African 
American.  The surrounding area is approximately 75% African 
American and 25% white.	

	Until Kantako's station went on the air, no Black owned or 
Black run stations existed in Springfield.   As a result, 
WTRA/Black Liberation Radio began broadcasting community 
information and music unavailable anywhere else in Springfield.   
In a given week, Kantako broadcasts the voices of anywhere from 
20 to 50 persons from the community.   This programming has 
included 
interviews with authors, scholars and activists around the 
country concerned about black genocide; lots of politically 
conscious rap and reggae music (no sexist or materialistic 
stuff); discussions and commentary (from a critical 
perspective) on local and national events effecting the 
Black community; interviews with victims of police 
misconduct and abuse; criticism of the NAACP and Urban 
League for being co-opted and irrelevant to current 
conditions in Black America; anti-drug messages recognizing 
the drug plague as a method of social control of Black men; 
severe criticism of U.S. domination of people of color 
around the world; rebroadcasting of speeches by Malcolm X, 
Minister Louis Farrakhan, Stokley Carmichael, Huey Newton, 
Angela Davis, and other Black activists....

S. Shields and R. Ogles, "Black Liberation Radio: A Case Study of 
the Micro-Radio Movement" (paper, presented at 22nd annual 
meeting of Popular Culture Association) (March, 1992).   The 
community has provided strong support for Kantako's broadcasts, 
particularly Kantako's neighbors in the John Hay Homes and other 
members of Springfield's African American community.   Volunteers 
have offered music tapes, leads on stories, and technical and air 
time assistance.  

	WTRA broadcast community-oriented programming for 18 months 
without government interference.  In January 1989, following the 
beating of a local boxing coach and his son by Springfield 
security police, Kantako broadcast a taped hospital bedside 
interview with the victims, which led to considerable outrage 
among Kantako's listeners.  Soon other victims of alleged police 
brutality began calling the station and airing their stories.  
Following Kantako's broadcast of these calls and accusations of a 
police cover-up during a three-day hostage crisis in which two 
people were killed, local police notified the FCC, citing a 
citizen's alleged complaint of on-air profanity.  Evidence 
suggests that this complaint was generated by the police 
department in response to these broadcasts condemning local 
police misconduct. 

	On April 5, 1989 a representative of the FCC, accompanied by 
five local police officers, visited Kantako and ordered him to 
cease broadcasting.  Kantako complied with the FCC order until 
April 17, 1989, when he again resumed broadcasting.  The FCC then 
cited Kantako for broadcasting without a license and fined him 
$750.00.  Kantako unsuccessfully appealed the fine, asserting his 
First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The FCC subsequently 
brought Kantako before a Federal Judge to obtain a judgment 
against Kantako in the amount of $750.  At the hearing on March 
30, 1990, Kantako refused to proceed until he was represented by 
an attorney.  Since Kantako's low income prevented him from 
hiring an attorney, he demanded the government appoint him 
counsel.  Kantako's request was refused on the grounds that the 
FCC violation involved a civil, not a criminal, penalty.  Kantako 
subsequently refused to participate in any further proceedings.  
Judgment was issued against Kantako.  Kantako continues to refuse 
to pay the $750 fine ordered by the Court. 

	Today, Black Liberation Radio continues to operate despite 
the outstanding $750 fine ordered by the Federal court.  In fact, 
since August 14, 1990, Black Liberation Radio has expanded its 
broadcast schedule to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Kantako 
reports that 40 to 50 people speak on Black Liberation Radio in 
any given week.  Many of these participants have suffered 
retribution from local police.  This retribution often takes the 
form of minor harassment like selective parking enforcement, or 
more serious acts, such as searches and arrests based on 
questionable evidence.  See: L. Rodriguez, "Rappin' in the Hood," 
The Nation, 193, Aug. 12/19, 1991.  At one point, Springfield 
police arrested, booked and took mug shots of Kantako's 9-year 
old son, a radio volunteer, after he became involved in a shoving 
match during a soccer game at his elementary school.  Then in 
late 1991, a .357 Magnum slug was fired through the Kantako 
family's front room window as Kantako was broadcasting a live 
telephone interview on the subject of white supremacy.  The 
bullet barely missed Kantako's head.  The Springfield Police, who 
have a sub-station located in the housing projects near the 
Kantakos' apartment, never came to investigate, despite the fact 
that they daily monitor and tape the station.  The Springfield 
Housing authority, which regularly tries to evict the Kantako 
family on a variety of charges, also failed to inquire about this 
murder attempt.  
	
	Mbanna Kantako and his family have also been threatened with 
eviction from his housing project apartment.  The Housing 
Authority has put forth a variety of reasons for the attempted 
eviction, but a new provision added to the lease of the 
apartments in the John Hay Homes where Kantako lives suggests the 
real reason.  The new provision requires that tenants
refrain from the installation of any antenna, radio 
equipment and/or other communications devices on any SHA 
(Springfield Housing Authority) property without written 
consent of management.

Taken literally, this overbroad prohibition would outlaw plugging 
in a television or radio without prior consent.  This provisions 
appears to be aimed at silencing Kantako and his station Black 
Liberation Radio.
	
	In April 1992 following the acquittal of four police 
officers accused in the Rodney King beating, the John Hay Homes 
experienced uprisings similar to those occurring throughout the 
country.  Rather than examining the implications of the verdict's 
response, the authorities in Springfield instead assigned blame 
on those operating Black Liberation Radio.  Recently there have 
been renewed calls for the FCC to act on its judgment against 
Kantako and to shut down the station.


OVERVIEW OF STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY TO 
REGULATE BROADCASTING STEMS FROM CONGRESS' CONSTITUTIONAL 
POWER TO REGULATE INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

	The Communications Act of 1934 was enacted to maintain the 
control of the United States over all the channels of interstate 
and foreign radio transmissions.  47 U.S.C. § 301 (1989).  This 
regulatory authority is in accord with Congress' commerce clause 
powers under the Constitution, permitting the regulation of 
commerce "among the several states."  U.S. Constitution, Art. , §  
.  Congress stated in the Communications Act that:

No person shall use or operate any apparatus for the 
transmission of energy or communications or signals by 
radio...within any State when the effects of such use extend 
beyond the borders of that State, or when interference is 
caused by such use, or operation with the transmission of 
such energy, communications, or signals from within said 
State to any place beyond its borders, or from any place 
beyond its borders to any place within said State, or with 
the transmission or reception of such energy, communications 
or signals from and/or to places beyond the borders of said 
State...except under and in accordance with this Act and 
with a license in that behalf granted under the provisions 
of this Act.  

47 U.S.C. § 301(d) (1989).  The language of § 301 clearly states 
that Congress intended to regulate the transmission of signals by 
radio which interfered with interstate commerce.  Power to 
regulate radio broadcasts was granted to the FCC pursuant to § 
303 of the Communications Act.  According to § 303, the 
Commission may make regulations not inconsistent with law as 
necessary to prevent interference between stations and to carry 
out the provisions of the Communications Act as public 
convenience, interest or necessity requires.  47 U.S.C. § 303(f) 
(1989).  In addition, the Commission may make rules and 
regulations, and prescribe restrictions and conditions not 
inconsistent with law, to carry out the provisions of the 
Communications Act or other treaties or conventions to which the 
United States is a party.  47 U.S.C. § 303(r) (1989).

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RULES REQUIRE THAT ALL NEW 
FM STATIONS HAVE A MINIMUM EFFECTIVE RADIATED POWER (ERP) OF 
100 WATTS, PURSUANT TO 47 C.F.R. §73.211(a)(1)(i).

	The broadcasts of Black Liberation Radio are currently 
prohibited under current FCC rules and regulations.  The 
Commission has authority to allocate space on the radio spectrum 
at 47 U.S.C. § 303(c).  Since 1978, the Commission has required 
that all FM station (except those in Alaska) maintain a minimum 
effective radiated power (ERP) of 100 watts.  47 C.F.R. 
§73.211(a)(1)(i) (1990).  FM stations licensed to broadcast with 
an ERP between 100 and 6,000 watts are denominated as Class A 
stations.  Id.  Class A stations may have an ERP of less than 100 
watts provided that the station's reference distance equals or 
exceeds six kilometers.  47 C.F.R. § 73.211(a)(3) (1990).  
"Reference distance" is a technical concept defined in the 
regulations at 47.C.F.R. § 73.211(b)(1)(i) (1990).  Because of 
the limited effective radiated power of Black Liberation Radio 
(approximately 1 mile), this station's signal is unable to exceed 
this minimum reference distance requirement of six kilometers. 

	The prohibition on licensing new FM stations operating at 
less than 100 watts ERP stems from a 1978 Commission Report and 
Order issued by the Commission pertaining to Class D FM 
Educational Broadcast Stations operating at a minimum 10 watts.  
This freeze on 10-watt operations was initiated following 
issuance of the Commission's First Report and Order, 68 F.C.C. 2d 
988 (1978).  The Commissions's rationale for requiring a minimum 
broadcast signal of 100 watts for most Class D educational FM 
radio stations is found in the FCC's 1978 Second Report and 
Order, In The Matter of Changes in the Rules Relating to 
Noncommercial Educational FM Broadcast Stations 69 F.C.C. 2d 240, 
44 R.R. 2d 235 (1978), amended, 70 F.C.C. 2d 972, 44 R.R. 2d 1685 
(1979).  Prior to the Second Report and Order, Class D 
educational stations could operate with no more than 10 watts 
Effective Radiated Power (ERP).  This was the lowest FM power 
licensed by the Commission.  Class D licenses are available only 
for noncommercial educational operation.  The Commission sought 
to remove these low power Class D stations from the FM band based 
on a judgment that these channels were not being used in an 
effective and efficient manner.  Memorandum Opinion and Order, 70 
F.C.C. 2d 973 (1979).   Because of this ruling, no new Class D 
applications may now be filed with the Commission.  47 CFR § 
73.512(c) (1989).  

	[DELETE THIS PARAGRAPH?] Although 47 U.S.C. § 324 directs 
all broadcast stations to operate with the minimum power 
necessary, the Commission in their Second Report and Order raised 
the minimum effective radiated power of these Class D educational 
FM stations from 10 watts to 100 watts.  [cite...]  The 
Commissions cited three reasons for increasing the minimum ERP on 
these Class D stations:  technical efficiency, wider coverage, 
and better quality service.  Id. at [cite].  However, despite the 
Commission's goals, the implementation of the Second Report and 
Order failed to adequately satisfy any of these primary 
objectives.  See:  Note, "Educational FM Radio - the Failure of 
Reform, 34 Fed. Com. L.J. 432 (1982).  As a result, Mbanna 
Kantako, micro radio practitioners and their listening audience 
challenge this prohibition on low power FM broadcasting.


THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION REQUIRES THAT THOSE 
APPLYING FOR NEW RADIO BROADCAST STATIONS DEMONSTRATE ACCESS 
TO MINIMUM FINANCIAL CAPITAL RESERVES, THEREBY PREVENTING 
POOR AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES FROM GAINING ACCESS TO 
BROADCAST FACILITIES.
	Applicants for new radio broadcast stations are required to 
demonstrate an ability to construct and operate the station for 
three months, without relying upon advertising or other revenue 
to meet these costs.  Financial Qualifications standards of aural 
broadcast applicants, 69 F.C.C. 2d 407 (1978).  The Commission 
alleged that this policy would specifically benefit minority 
applicants seeking entry into the radio broadcast service 
inasmuch as station financing had been a principal barrier to 
minority broadcast ownership.  Id.  However, such a financial 
barrier is discriminatory on its face in that it prevents those 
without wealth from gaining access to the radio medium.  
Furthermore, this financial barrier as applied works to 
discriminate against minority broadcasters who lack the $50,000 
to $100,000 necessary to operate a station at a loss for three 
consecutive months.  The effect of this rule is to deny 
underrepresented poor and minority communities any effective 
voice on the airwaves, thereby violating their right to impart 
and receive communication over the public airwaves.

FOR A SHOWING OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE EQUAL 
PROTECTION ACT, THE SUPREME COURT REQUIRES DISCRIMINATORY 
INTENT OR PURPOSE.  UPON A SHOWING THAT RACIAL 
DISCRIMINATION IS A SUBSTANTIAL OR MOTIVATING FACTOR, THE 
BURDEN OF PROOF MUST SHIFT TO THE LAW'S DEFENDERS.
	The Supreme Court has recently argued that a showing of 
racial discrimination under the Equal Protection clause requires 
proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose.  Once racial 
discrimination is shown to have been a "substantial" or 
"motivating" factor behind enactment of the law, the burden 
shifts to the law's defenders to demonstrate that the law would 
have been enacted without this factor.	Hunter v. Underwood, 471 
U.S. 222, 227-28 (1985) (quoting Arlington Heights v. 
Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-65 (1977)).  

	In Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 110 S.Ct. 2997 (1990) 
the Supreme Court, in upholding the Commissions's policy 
permitting distress sales to minority broadcasters, held that the 
promotion of minority ownership and implementation of the FCC 
minority ownership policies serves an important national 
interest.	  Yet under the guise of broadcast deregulation, the 
Commission has eradicated the power of the broadcast media to 
serve minority interests.  In light of the detailed pattern and 
practice of racial discrimination which existed within the FCC up 
through the 1970s, the Commission's actions with respect to 
broadcast deregulation reveal a pattern of active disregard and 
neglect with regard to the needs of minority broadcasters and 
communities.  See infra at 85.  Commission rules prohibiting the 
unlicensed operation of micro radio by minority broadcasters when 
these broadcasts advance the public interest reflect the 
Commission's continuing discriminatory policies and practices.

ARTICLE 19 OF THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND 
POLITICAL RIGHTS, RECENTLY RATIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE, GRANTS CITIZENS OF ALL NATIONS ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF 
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.
	The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was 
ratified by the United States Senate on April 2, 1992.  This 
document was deposited at the United Nations by President Bush on 
June 8, 1992, and becomes effective on September 8, 1992.  On 
September 8, 1992, this Human Rights document will have the force 
of law in the United States.  Article 19(2) of this International 
Covenant states that everyone shall have the right to freedom of 
expression.  This right includes "freedom to seek, receive and 
impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of 
frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of 
art, or through other media of his choice."  Although Article 
19(3) of the International Covenant indicates that the above 
rights may be subject to certain restrictions, these restrictions 
may only be such as are provided by law and necessary for respect 
of the rights or reputations of others, or for the protection of 
national security, public order, or public health and morals.

THE AMERICAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS:  ARTICLE 13, 
Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights entered 
into force on July 18, 1978.  This document states that everyone 
has the right to freedom of thought and expression, including the 
freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all 
kinds regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing, in 
print, in the form of art, or through any other medium of one's 
choice.  The exercise of this right is subject to some 
limitations such as respect for the rights and reputations of 
others, and the protection of national security, public order, or 
public health or morals.  However, this right of expression may 
not be restricted by "indirect methods or means, such as the 
abuse of government or private controls over newsprint, radio 
broadcasting frequencies, or implements or equipment used in the 
dissemination of information, or by any other means tending to 
impede the communication and circulation of ideas and opinions."

EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS:  ARTICLE 10
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, amended 
according to the provisions of Protocol No.3 entered into force 
on 21 September 1970, and amended according to the provisions of 
Protocol No. 5 entered into force on 20 December 1971.  This 
document states that everyone has the right to freedom of 
expression.  This right includes the freedom to hold opinions and 
to receive and impart information and ideas without interference 
by public authority and regardless of frontiers.  Article 10 does 
not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, 
television or cinema enterprises.  However, the interpretation of 
Article 10(2) in the case of Radio Gropera v. Switzerland, 
Judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A No. 173, calls into question 
the validity of prohibiting radio stations with less than 100 
watts.  See infra at 109.

	A.	THE FCC HAS NO AUTHORITY TO REGULATE LOW POWER FM 
BROADCASTS WHICH 1) DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND STATE BORDERS 
OR WHICH 2) DO NOT INTERFERE WITH OTHER BROADCASTS THAT 
EXTEND BEYOND STATE BORDERS. 
	
	The Communications Act of 1934 was enacted to maintain the 
control of the United States over all the channels of interstate 
and foreign radio transmissions.  47 U.S.C. § 301 (1989).  
Congress expressly stated within the Communications Act of 1934 
that:

No person shall use or operate any apparatus for the 
transmission of energy or communications or signals by 
radio...within any State when the effects of such use extend 
beyond the borders of that State, or when interference is 
caused by such use, or operation with the transmission of 
such energy, communications, or signals from within said 
State to any place beyond its borders, or from any place 
beyond its borders to any place within said State, or with 
the transmission or reception of such energy, communications 
or signals from and/or to places beyond the borders of said 
State...except under and in accordance with this Act and 
with a license in that behalf granted under the provisions 
of this Act.  

47 U.S.C. § 301(d) (1989).  This language clearly states that 
Congress intended to regulate the transmission of signals by 
radio which interfered with interstate commerce.  Power to 
regulate radio broadcasts is granted to the FCC pursuant to § 303 
of the Communications Act.  Under § 303, the Commission may make 
regulations not inconsistent with law as it may deem to necessary 
to prevent interference between stations and to carry out the 
provisions of this Act as public convenience, interest or 
necessity requires.  47 U.S.C. § 303(f) (1989) (emphasis added).  
In addition, the Commission may make such rules and regulations, 
and prescribe such restrictions and conditions, not inconsistent 
with law, as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this 
Act or other treaties or conventions to which the United States 
is a party.  47 U.S.C. § 303(r) (1989) (emphasis added).

	Although the Commission may regulate every aspect of radio 
broadcasting that touches upon interstate commerce, the 
Commission has no authority to regulate those activities which 
consist solely of intrastate commerce.  While Congress may 
lawfully require the licensing and regulation of intrastate radio 
broadcasting stations where their operation interferes with 
interstate commerce, United States v. Gregg, 5 F.Supp. 848, 857 
(S.D. TX, 1934), the Commission has no authority to regulate 
micro radio broadcasts which extend only 1 mile, where these 
broadcasts are transmitted on an open frequency and do not 
interfere with the transmission or reception of broadcast signals 
transmitted from outside the State into that State, or 
transmitted from inside the State and crossing the borders into 
another State.  As a result, operation of Black Liberation Radio 
in no way implicates the powers of Congress or the Commission to 
regulate interstate radio broadcasts. 

	Mbanna Kantako's intrastate micro radio broadcasts must be 
distinguished from other low power radio broadcasts found to be 
subject to regulation under the Communications Act.  In United 
States v. Gregg, 5 F.Supp 848 (1934), the Federal Radio 
Commission (FRC), the Commissions predecessor, sought to stop the 
broadcasts of a community radio station operated in Houston by 
the Voice of Labor, Inc.  In that case, defendants broadcast on 
an AM radio station at 1,310 kilocycles with station power from 2 
to 4 watts.  Id. at 850.  The court upheld the FRC's jurisdiction 
over the Houston station's intrastate broadcasts after observing 
that the "service area" (the area within which the program being 
broadcast can be heard over an ordinary receiver set) extended an 
average of 30 miles surrounding the station.  Id. at 851.  In 
addition, the court noted that the "nuisance area" (area where 
the broadcast is sufficiently strong to produce heterodyne 
interference with the broadcasting of other stations, but not 
sufficient to allow the listener over the ordinary radio to 
understand it) was "some considerable distance beyond the service 
area."  Id.  Based on the wide radius of the Houston station's 
broadcasts, the court was persuaded that defendant's radio 
signals significantly interfered with the transmission of energy, 
communications and signals by other licensed radio stations at 
the same frequency of 1,310 kilocycles from places beyond the 
limits of Texas to places within Texas.  Id.  Because the daytime 
broadcasts of the Houston station seriously interfered with the 
radio signals from outside the State, the court concluded that 
Congress and the FRC was within its authority to regulate this 
intrastate activity.

	Unlike the Houston station's broadcasts in the above case, 
Black Liberation Radio transmits a signal that can be heard only 
within a radius of approximately 1.5 miles of the station 
transmitter.  Although the "nuisance area" of this signal extends 
somewhat farther, the maximum potential radius of interference 
caused by Kantako's signal cannot go far.  Additionally, this 
signal in no way interferes with the transmission or reception of 
signals of other licensed in-state or out-of-state stations 
broadcasting at 101.7 megahertz on the FM band.  In fact, 
Kantako's early broadcasts went largely unnoticed outside the 
black community of Springfield until his coverage of the police 
beating of Johnny Howell brought the station to the attention of 
the Springfield community.  When the FCC issued their first 
complaint in April 1989, WTRA had been on the air for 18 months 
broadcasting programs of music and community information without 
incident.  In addition, although the police claim they alerted 
the FCC after a citizen's compliant of on-air obscenity, evidence 
suggests that it was the police themselves who generated the 
complaint following these particularly strong programs on police 
misconduct.  The record otherwise reveals no complaints to the 
FCC regarding Black Liberation Radio's signal interference with 
other stations at 107.1 MHz on the FM band.  Because the 
broadcast radius of Kantako's micro radio station is relatively 
insignificant by comparison to defendant's 30 mile signal radius 
in United States v. Gregg, and because no interference can be 
found with the broadcast signal of any station either 
broadcasting into Illinois from out-of-state, or from Illinois to 
outside that State's borders, Black Liberation Radio's broadcasts 
can be distinguished from the serious interference with 
interstate broadcasts found in United States v. Gregg.   

	The case of United States v. Brown 661 F.2d 855 (1981, 10th 
Cir.), also provides insight into the Commission's regulation of 
radio signals which may extend or interfere with signals 
extending beyond the borders of the State pursuant to § 301 of 
the Communications Act.  In United States v. Brown, the court 
ruled that evidence that an unlicensed citizen's band radio 
transmission was powerful enough to cross the state border was 
sufficient to sustain a conviction for violation of § 301(d) of 
the Communications Act, although the jury was never instructed 
that the Government must show the signals actually left the 
State.  In sustaining defendant's conviction, the court noted 
that § 301(d) expressly states that the United States intends to 
control all channels of interstate radio transmission.  Id. at 
856.  Here, the court held that a violation of § 301(d) is 
satisfied by proof that defendant's transmission was merely 
powerful enough to cross the state border.  Id.  In Brown, the 
court found there was sufficient evidence presented to the jury 
to support a judgment that defendant was in violation of § 
301(d).  Id.  This evidence consisted of radio transmissions 
intercepted within the broadcaster's state by FCC agents.  
Although these radio signals were intercepted only a few miles 
from defendant's transmitter, the wattage of the transmissions 
was greater than FCC allowed for citizen's band use, and evidence 
was sufficient to show that the transmissions could have crossed 
state borders or interfered with interstate radio signals.  Id. 
at 855-56.  Defendant's transmitter, which was confiscated by the 
FCC, was later found capable of transmitting signals over 100 
miles.  Id. at 855.

	Again, there is no such showing that the 1 watt signal of 
Black Liberation Radio has in any way interfered or could 
interfere with radio signals travelling interstate.  The 
broadcast signal of this micro radio station extends 
approximately 1.5 miles, not 100 miles.  Additionally, this 
signal can be heard only within an area of Springfield, Illinois 
encompassed by the John Hay Homes, a housing project in a 
neglected area of that community.  As a result, Black Liberation 
Radio's signal is significantly weaker than those signals found 
in cases upholding the FCC's authority to regulate interstate and 
certain intrastate radio transmissions.  The broadcast signal of 
Black Liberation Radio simply cannot extend beyond the city 
borders of Springfield, much less the State borders of Illinois.  
In any event, no nearby broadcasters utilize the space on the FM 
spectrum (107.1 MHz) currently occupied by Black Liberation 
Radio.  If the FCC were to later allocate this frequency to a 
licensed broadcaster, Black Liberation Radio concedes that it 
would change frequencies rather than interfere with a licensed 
station's broadcast signal.  However, inasmuch as no interference 
with any licensed broadcast outlet currently exists, and inasmuch 
as it is physically impossible for Black Liberation Radio to 
transmit its signal across state lines, no violation of § 301(d) 
can be found.  

	The plain language of § 301(d) makes it clear that the 
Commission is authorized only to regulate those broadcasts 
transmitted across state borders, or those broadcasts which in 
some other manner interfere with licensed stations engaging in 
commerce among the States.  "If Congress had intended to regulate 
broadcasts which could but do not in fact extend beyond state 
boundaries, it was capable of saying so."  Id. at 857 (McKay, 
dissenting).  In fact, the language of the § 301(d) reveals that 
Congress intended to regulate less than the full commerce clause 
power inasmuch as this language covers two kinds of broadcasts 
only:  1) those whose effects extend beyond state borders; and 2) 
those whose effects do not extend beyond state borders but which 
interfere with other broadcasts that themselves extend beyond 
state borders.  Id.  As such, the operation of micro radio 
station Black Liberation Radio is not governed by any of the 
statutory language of § 301(d) nor by any subsequent case law.  
The Commission therefore lacks authority to regulate Black 
Liberation Radio's micro radio broadcast inasmuch as that station 
is engaged solely in intra-state broadcasting, with no 
discernable or likely impact on interstate broadcasts of any 
kind.  The Commission's attempt to silence Black Liberation Radio 
violates Mbanna Kantako's First Amendment right to communicate in 
that the Commission has exceeded Congressional authority pursuant 
to § 301(d) and § 303(f) of the Communications Act.   Because the 
FCC lacks authority to regulate this micro radio station, the 
Commission must respect Kantako's First Amendment right to 
communicate as well as that community's right to receive 
Kantako's low power broadcasts.  


II.  THE RIGHT TO COMMUNICATE AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT

A.	THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS -  THE 
PURPOSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS TO PROTECT THE 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BY ALLOWING FOR A) AN INFORMED 
PUBLIC; B) EXCHANGE OF UNPOPULAR AND UNORTHODOX 
OPINIONS ALONG WITH REGULAR COMMERCE; AND C) BROAD 
DIALOGUE AMONG THE POPULACE; FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS ARE 
THE RIGHTS OF THE HEARERS AS WELL AS THE COMMUNICATORS.

MEIKELJOHN ARGUMENT

	..."speech concerning public affairs is more than self-
expression; it is the essence of self-government (cited at 
Syracuse Peace Council, 2 FCC Rec 5043).  Because it is the 
people in a democratic system who "are entrusted with the 
responsibility for judging and evaluating the relative merits of 
conflicting arguments," the "[g]overnment is forbidden to assume 
the task of ultimate judgment, lest the people lose their ability 
to govern themselves."  (locate FN 220 and 221 in Syracuse).

	As the Court has previously noted, "speech concerning public 
affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-
government."  Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 74-75 (1964).  
In addition, "(i)t is the right of the public to receive suitable 
access to social, political, aesthetic, moral and other ideas and 
experiences...(and) that right may not constitutionally be 
abridged either by Congress or by the FCC."  Red Lion 
Broadcasting, supra, at 390.  Consequently, the Commission's 
failure to permit the continued operation of low power micro 
radio outlets such as Black Liberation Radio constitutes an 
unconstitutional violation of Mbanna Kantako's First Amendment 
rights.



B.	47 CFR § 73.506 OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT IS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE:  BLANKET REFUSAL TO 
LICENSE OR OTHERWISE PERMIT VERY LOW POWER RADIO 
BROADCASTS IS, ON ITS FACE, AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
VIOLATION OF 1ST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

	Even assuming the FCC has jurisdiction to regulate micro 
radio pursuant to § 301(d) et. seq., the Commission's refusal to 
license or otherwise permit low power micro radio broadcasts 
unlawfully infringes upon the First Amendment rights of Kantako 
and his listeners.  

	The Supreme Court has previously noted that the people as a 
whole retain their interest in free speech by radio and their 
collective right to have the medium function consistently with 
the ends and purposes of the First Amendment.  Red Lion 
Broadcasting, 395 U.S. 367, 390 (1969).  In addition, "(i)t is 
the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited 
marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail, 
rather than to countenance monopolization of that market, whether 
it be by the Government itself or a private licensee.  Id., 
citing Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 20 (1945), 
New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964), Abrams 
v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., 
dissenting).  The Supreme Court also observed in Columbia 
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee 412 
U.S. 94 (1973) that:
Balancing the various First Amendment interests involved in 
the broadcast media and determining what best serves the 
public's right to be informed is a task of great delicacy 
and difficulty....  The problems of regulation are rendered 
more difficult because the broadcast industry is dynamic in 
terms of technological change; solutions adequate a decade 
ago are not necessarily so now, and those acceptable today 
may well be outmoded ten years hence.
	Id. at ____.  
	The Congressional mandate of the Commission is to regulate 
the airwaves in the public interest, convenience and necessity.  
The Commission was created to regulate interstate commerce in 
communication by radio "so as to make available, so far as 
possible, to all the people in the United States a rapid, 
efficient, nation-wide and worldwide wire and radio communication 
service." C.J. Community Services, Inc. v. FCC, 15 R.R. 2029, 
2032 (D.C. Cir., 1957) (citing "Can Community Antenna TV Be 
Enjoined"?, 20 Albany L.Rev. 69, 75 (1956)).  As a result, the 
Commission has a duty to "devise through its rule-making 
authority, the basis upon which 'all the people of the people of 
the United States' may receive service through a licensed 
station."  Id.   The language of the Communications Act enables 
the Commission to take into account extenuating circumstances 
where the technical violation of unlicensed broadcasting has 
occurred as a means to facilitate the public interest.  See Id.  

	Because of the need for micro radio in Springfield and other 
communities, the Commission must accommodate this new 
communications technology rather than perpetuate its outright 
prohibition.  In 1987, the Commission affirmed the Supreme 
Court's assertion in FCC v. League of Women Voters that "the 
dramatic transformation in the telecommunications marketplace 
provides a basis for the Court to reconsider its application of 
diminished First Amendment protection to electronic media."  In 
re Complaint of Syracuse Peace Council, 2 FCC Rcd 5043, 5058 
(1987) (citing FCC v. League of Women Voters at ___).  The 
Commission went on to say that
Despite the physical differences between the electronic and 
print media, their roles in our society are identical, and 
we believe that the same First Amendment principles should 
be equally applicable to both.  This is the method set forth 
in our Constitution for maximizing the public interest; and 
furthering the public interest is likewise our mandate under 
the Communications Act.
	Id.  Additionally, the Communications Act provides that "the 
Commission from time to time, as public convenience, interest, or 
necessity requires, shall...study new uses for radio, provide for 
experimental uses of frequencies, and generally encourage the 
larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest.  
47 U.S.C. § 303(g) (1989).  In light of the Commission's 
statutory duty, failure to permit micro radio broadcasts under 
any circumstances constitutes an infringement on Mbanna Kantako's 
First Amendment right to communicate.  In addition, the right of 
the surrounding community to receive information is impermissibly 
burdened by the FCC's failure to authorize micro radio broadcasts 
where these broadcasts serve to promote vital First Amendment 
concerns and no interference with licensed broadcasts otherwise 
occurs.   Again, "(t)he First Amendment must...safeguard not only 
the right of the public to hear debate, but also the right of the 
individual to participate in that debate and to attempt to 
persuade others to their points of view."  Columbia Broadcasting 
Services, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 193 
(1973) (Brennan, dissenting) (citing Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 
516, 537 (1945); and NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 429-30 
(1963)).  Thus, failure of the Commission to license or otherwise 
permit micro radio broadcasts is unconstitutional where there is 
unused space on the radio spectrum and low power access to the 
airwaves does not interferes with or otherwise impede the 
transmission of other radio signals.  


C.	THE FM PORTION OF THE SPECTRUM IS A FIRST AMENDMENT 
FORUM:  HAVING OPENED THE FORUM TO 1ST AMENDMENT 
ACTIVITY, THE GOVERNMENT MUST APPLY 1ST AMENDMENT 
STANDARDS TO ITS USE.
	Although the Commission retains regulatory authority over 
micro radio, no compelling interest supports the blanket 
prohibition of very low power community radio broadcasts.  The 
Communications Act of 1934 states that the Commission may assign 
bands of frequencies to the various classes of stations, assign 
frequencies for each individual station and determine the power 
which each station shall use.  47 U.S.C. § 303(c).  However, 
while the Commission serves the role of "traffic cop" with regard 
to spectrum allocation, a blanket refusal to permit low power FM 
broadcasts is an arbitrary and capricious abuse of Congressional 
authority, and is therefore an unconstitutional violation of 
Kantako's First Amendment rights.

	The FM band of the electromagnetic spectrum is a place where 
speakers communicate messages to an audience, and, like any other 
forum where First Amendment activity is subject to interference, 
government may make reasonable rules for its use, FCC v. League 
of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364 (1984); compare Lovel v. Griffin, 
303 U.S. 444(1938), Kovacs v. Cooper, 303 U.S. 77 (1949), Feiner 
v. New York, 340 U.S. 315 (1951), Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 
(1981), Ward v. Rock Against Racism,     U.S.     (19  ).   Thus 
Congress enacted the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.A. 151 
et seq., and created the Federal Communications Commission 
empowering it to make such regulations as are necessary to 
prevent interference and otherwise to carry out the provisions of 
the Act, 47 U.S.C.A. 303, 303(f), and 303(r).  But the Commission 
is specifically forbidden to promulgate any rule or condition 
"which shall interfere with the right of free speech," 47 
U.S.C.A. 326, Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 
(1969).

	While the government may regulate activity in a First 
Amendment forum so long as reasonable rules are adopted to 
regulate the time, place and manner of protected speech, it is 
equally true that upon opening a forum to First Amendment 
activity the government is constrained in the exclusions it may 
enforce.  In the traditional public forum, the government may not 
enforce content based exclusions unless such enforcement is 
necessary to serve a compelling state interest and the regulation 
is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.  Perry Educator's Assn v. 
Perry Local Educator's Assn, 460 U.S. 37 (1983), Widmar v. 
Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455 
(1980), and Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92 
(1972).  Further, while the rule of Miami Herald Publishing Co. 
v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), foreclosing regulation of 
editorial freedom has not been fully applied to broadcast media, 
nonetheless sensitivity to the First Amendment nature of the 
activity in the broadcast forum requires that editorial 
restrictions be narrowly tailored to further a substantial 
governmental interest," FCC v. League of Women Voters, supra, at 
___.

	The government must meet a high burden in justifying speech 
restrictions relating to traditional public fora,  since the 
purpose of the public forum doctrine is to give effect to the 
broad command of the First Amendment to protect speech from 
governmental interference.  Society for Krishna Consciousness v. 
Lee, 1992 U.S. Lexis 4532, ___ U.S. ___ (1992) (Kennedy, 
concurring in part).  Traditional public fora are those that "by 
long tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to 
assembly and debate," such as "streets and parks which have 
immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public, and 
time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, 
communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public 
questions.  Perry Ed. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educator's Ass'n, 460 
U.S. 37, 45 (1983) (quotations and citations omitted); see also, 
e.g., Frisby, 108 S.Ct at 2499, Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 
460-61 (1980).  The Court in Society for Krishna Consciousness v. 
Lee, supra, reiterated that regulation of speech on government 
property that has traditionally been available for public 
expression is subject to the highest scrutiny, with such 
regulations surviving only if they are narrowly drawn to achieve 
a compelling state interest.  Id. at ___, citing Perry at 45.  In 
addition, content-neutral regulations such as time, place and 
manner restrictions must be narrowly tailored to serve a 
significant government interest and must leave open alternative 
channels of communication.  Perry, 460 U.S. at 45.  

	The rule that individuals have a right to use public fora 
such as streets and parks to communicate their views was first 
handed down in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 
307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939) wherein the court determined the 
government had a high burden in justifying any restrictions, 
inasmuch as these avenues of expression were held in trust for 
the use of the public, and "have been used for purposes 
of...communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing 
public questions."  Id.  However, while the court in Hague v. 
Committee for Industrial Organization maintained that streets and 
parks "have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the 
public, and time out of mind, have been used for purposes of 
assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing 
public questions" (Id.), in fact no right of free speech as we 
now know it existed in this country until a basic transformation 
of the law governing free speech occurred during the period in 
which the Hague decision was issued.  See:  D. Kairys, "Freedom 
of Speech," in Politics of Law, 237 (1990).  

	Prior to the decision in Hague citizens were typically 
subject to arrest and incarceration for asserting their First 
Amendment right to speak on public streets, sidewalks, and parks.  
See Commonwealth v. Davis, 162 Mass. 510 (1895); aff'd in Davis 
v. Massachusetts, 167 U.S. 43 (1897).  At this time, courts were 
more frequently of the opinion espoused earlier by Oliver Wendell 
Holmes that:
For the Legislature absolutely or conditionally to forbid 
public speaking in a highway or public park is no more an 
infringement of the rights of a member of the public than 
for the owner of a private house to forbid it in his house.  
Commonwealth v. Davis, at 511.
	Rather than overruling the Court's earlier affirmation of 
Commonwealth v. Davis, the later Supreme Court ruling in Hague 
referred instead to natural law, arguing that "(s)uch use of the 
streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of 
the privileges, immunities, rights and liberties of citizens."  
Hague at ___.  Ultimately, until Hague the Supreme Court had 
consistently failed to make any major pronouncements repudiating 
the holding of Davis.  In addition, the Court consistently failed 
to reverse any convictions occurring under the Espionage Act, 
which at the time violated the First Amendment rights of citizens 
by serving to criminalize dissent.  See: Schenck v. United 
States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919).  See also: Abrams v. United States, 
250 U.S. 616 (1919); Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U.S. 204 
(1919); Debs v. United States, 249 U.S. 211 (1919).  That it took 
until 1939 for the Supreme Court to assert its position in Hague 
shows the extent to which the Court's transformation reflected 
fundamental changes in American society; changes which included 
World War I, the Depression, the New Deal, and the prominent role 
of the Labor Movement in contesting previous restrictions on 
public speech.  See, D. Kairys, supra, at 257.  

	Despite this legal fiction at the core of the public forum 
doctrine, the Court's reaffirmed in Society for Krishna 
Consciousness v. Lee, 1992 U.S. Lexis 4532, ___ U.S. ___ (1992) 
that streets and parks have "immemorially" been held in trust for 
the use of the public.  This assertion was here used to justify a 
prohibition on the solicitation of monies by members of the Hare 
Krishna religion at municipal airports.  In Society for Krishna 
Consciousness, the court held that traditional public fora are 
limited to public property which have as "a principle 
purpose...the free exchange of ideas'" (Id. at 6, quoting 
Cornelius v. NAACP) and that this purpose must be evidenced by a 
long-standing historical practice of permitting speech.  Id. at 
7, ante, at 1-2 (O'Connor, concurring in part).  Nevertheless, 
the Court's strict adherence to a public forum doctrine developed 
over 50 years ago is no longer adequate given the social changes 
and technological advances which have shaped society over the 
intervening years.  Author David Kairys writes that:
Essentially, the law and society have frozen the scope and 
nature of our speech rights at levels appropriate to the 
1930s, when specific audiences like factory workers were 
geographically centered, and speaking, gathering and 
distributing literature in public places were the primary 
means of communication.  The speech rights conceived in that 
period do not provide access to our current means of 
communication.  Technological, social and cultural changes 
have rendered the fruits of the free-speech struggle 
somewhat obsolete.  Television, radio, newspapers 
(increasingly concentrated and limited in number and 
diversity), and direct mail now constitute the battleground, 
and the marketplace of ideas.  In the absence of mass-based 
demands, we have allowed no meaningful inroads into these 
media for people or groups without substantial money or 
power.

The scope and reality of our speech rights as a means of 
communication and persuasion are thus limited by these 
legal, economic and practical barriers.  

D. Kairys, "Freedom of Speech", The Politics of Law, p. 261-
262.
Another author has suggested with respect to the regulation of 
television that:
The time has come to update the public forum to the 
television age...television has become America's primary 
media language.  Use of the streets and parks for expression 
without the assistance of telecommunications facilities is 
only partially effective and does not adequately serve the 
goals of the First Amendment.

Consciousness, Justice Kennedy also recognized the static nature 
of the Court's public forum jurisprudence.  While affirming the 
right of Hare Krisha members to distribute flyers and literature 
inside public airport terminals, Justice Kennedy observed that:
the policies underlying the [public forum] doctrine cannot 
be given effect unless we recognize that open, public spaces 
and thoroughfares which are suitable for discourse may be 
public forums, whatever their historical pedigree and 
without concern for a precise classification of the 
property.  There is support in our precedents for such a 
view....  Without this recognition our [public] forum 
doctrine retains no relevance in times of fast-changing 
technology and increasing insularity.  In a country where 
most citizens travel by automobile and parks all too often 
become locales for crime rather than social intercourse, our 
failure to recognize the possibility that new types of 
government property may be appropriate forums for speech 
will lead to a serious curtailment of our expressive 
activity.  Society for Krishna Consciousness v. Lee, supra 
at ___, (Kennedy, concurring in part).
	For the public forum doctrine to become relevant to the 
modern world of instantaneous mass telecommunications, the 
Commission and the courts must recognize that AM and FM airwaves 
are the modern equivalent of parks, streets and sidewalks.  
Although technological access to the airwaves has not existed 
since time immemorial, the government promptly dedicated the 
airwaves to the public trust as a medium of communications, just 
as "all public streets are held in the public trust and are 
properly considered traditional public fora."  Society for 
Krishna Consciousness, supra, at ___ (Souter, concurring in 
part), citing Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 481 (1988).  By 
opening the public airwaves to communication, the government 
sought to regulate this forum only to the extent that such 
regulations advanced the public interest, convenience and 
necessity.  47 U.S.C. § 303 (1989).  Furthermore, the airwaves 
have as a principal purpose the promotion of the free exchange of 
ideas.   Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, 
Inc. 473 U.S. 788 (1985).  "Indeed, unlike the streets, parks, 
public libraries, and other "forums" that we have held to be 
appropriate for the exercise of First Amendment rights, the 
broadcast media are dedicated specifically to communication."  
Columbia Broadcasting Systems, Inc. v. Democratic National 
Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 195 (1973) (Brennan, dissenting).   
Certainly, the expression of ideas - whether political, 
commercial, musical, or otherwise - is the exclusive purpose of 
the broadcast spectrum.  Id.  

	As a result, the government must establish a compelling 
interest to justify any regulation interfering with First 
Amendment activity over the public airwaves.  Under such 
scrutiny, no compelling governmental interest supports the 
blanket prohibition of micro radio broadcasts which cause no 
significant interference with licensed broadcasts.  To the extent 
that the Commission has been found to have the authority to 
regulate other "pirate" or otherwise unlicensed radio broadcasts, 
Kantako's operation of micro radio station Black Liberation Radio 
may be distinguished inasmuch as this station, with a broadcast 
radius of only one mile, serves a compelling interest by 
providing political, social and cultural dialogue to the 
community of listeners otherwise unserved by the print and 
electronic media of Springfield and neighboring communities.  


D.	EVEN IF THE AIRWAVES ARE TREATED AS A DESIGNATED PUBLIC 
FORUM, PROHIBITION OF LOW POWER MICRO RADIO BROADCASTS 
DOES NOT SATISFY A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTEREST, NOR 
IS SUCH A PROHIBITION NARROWLY TAILORED TO MEET THAT 
INTEREST.  
	
	
	Even assuming that the court does not find that radio 
airwaves constitute a "traditional" public forum, in that the 
broadcast spectrum was opened by "modern" technology, these 
airwaves may still be properly categorized as a designated public 
forum.  A designated public forum is created when the state opens 
to the public generally "a place for expressive activity."  
Perry, 460 U.S. at 45.  Regulation of designated public fora is 
also subject to strict scrutiny.  Id. at 46.  A designated public 
forum must be "held open to the general public" or made available 
"for indiscriminate use by the general public."  Perry, 460 U.S. 
at 47.  The Court has stated that the fact that some members of 
the public are selectively invited to use government property 
does not convert the property into a designated public forum.  
Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 838 n.10 (1976).  Nevertheless, the 
Commission's regulations and licensing procedures with regard to 
the airwaves occur within the context of a public trust.  The 
Court has previously held that it is the people as a whole who 
retain their interest in free speech by radio and it is their 
collective right to have the medium function consistently with 
the ends and purposes of the First Amendment.  Red Lion 
Broadcasting, supra, at 390.  

	The nature of American democracy has undergone significant 
transformation as this country has entered the age of 
information.  As a result of this transformation, television and 
radio have become the modern-day equivalent of the printing 
press, with the spectrum constituting the modern-day equivalent 
of the street corner.  Indeed, the electronic media are today the 
public's prime source of information.  Broadcast "technology... 
supplants atomized, relatively informal communication with mass 
media as a prime source of national cohesion and news..."  
(cite...)  Although "full and free discussion" of ideas may have 
been a reality in the heyday of political pamphleteering, modern 
technological developments in the field of communications have 
made the soapbox orator and the leafleteer virtually obsolete.  

	Because the electronic media is today the dominant means of 
communicating with the public, any policy that absolutely denies 
citizens access to the airwaves necessarily renders even the 
concept of "full and free discussion" practically meaningless.  
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National 
Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 196 (1973) (Brennan, dissenting) (citing 
Red Lion, supra, at 386 n. 15)  Most Americans today rely on the 
electronic media almost exclusively to obtain information 
previously obtained through the print media or social gathering 
places.  As a result, the airwaves must be appropriately 
analogized to a designated public forum, with strict scrutiny 
required to uphold any time/place/manner regulations impinging 
upon First Amendment rights.  In addition, the means used in 
regulating micro-radio must be necessary.  

	In fact, the airwaves are may properly be analogized to 
newspaper racks on public streets.  In City of Lakewood v. Plain 
Dealer Publishing Co., 108 S.Ct. 2138 (1988) the Supreme Court 
struck down a local ordinance which apparently gave the city's 
mayor discretion in issuing permits to place newsracks on city 
streets.  See Id. at 2150-52.  Ultimately the Court ruled that 
the mayor's discretion in issuing permits was to be circumscribed 
by objective standards, holding that a public forum analysis 
applied where newsrack space was needed to distribute newspapers.  
See Id. at 2147-49.  Similarly, a public forum analysis is 
appropriate in regulating the distribution of space on the public 
airwaves.  As applied to Mbanna Kantako's operation of the micro 
radio station Black Liberation Radio, such an analysis would 
suggest that the Commission has exceeded its authority in 
absolutely prohibiting all micro radio broadcasts pursuant to 47 
C.F.R. § 73.506.  The Commission's decision to prohibit every 
micro radio broadcast must meet a compelling State need in light 
of Kantako's vital First Amendment rights.  Because Black 
Liberation Radio successfully broadcast for almost two years 
before the FCC was notified by Springfield police, and because 
the station was allowed to continue broadcasting to the John Hay 
Homes neighborhood on a daily uninterrupted basis following this 
April 1989 FCC intervention, the Commission can show no 
compelling reason why 1 watt FM broadcasts on Black Liberation 
Radio must be prohibited, particularly where no alternative forum 
exists in the community for the political and cultural viewpoints 
broadcast by this station.  Inasmuch as the broadcast spectrum 
was expanded in 1984 to allow for the allocation of nearly 700 
new stations, little justification remains for excluding the 
poor, particularly where the only access sought here is that 
enabling the broadcaster to reach residents of a low income 
housing project living within 1 mile of the radio transmitter.

E.	EVEN IF THE AIRWAVES ARE TREATED AS A NON-PUBLIC FORUM, 
PROHIBITION OF LOW POWER MICRO RADIO BROADCASTS IS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL INASMUCH AS NO RATIONAL BASIS EXISTS 
FOR THE ELIMINATION OF SUCH BROADCASTS FROM THE 
AIRWAVES.  THEREFORE, 47 CFR § 73.506 WHICH PROHIBITS 
ALL LICENSED FM BROADCASTS AT LESS THAN 100 WATTS IS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE AS AN UNREASONABLE 
EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY BY THE COMMISSION, IN THAT IT IS 
ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS.
	Even assuming the Court perceives the airwaves as a non-
public forum, the Commission can show no rational basis to 
justify the suppression of all unlicensed 1 watt FM radio 
broadcasts where those broadcasts serve an important public 
interest.  In Mbanna Kantako's case, the important public 
interest is that of providing political and cultural programming 
to a disenfranchised minority community otherwise ignored by 
other licensed media channels within that community.  

	The Commission's authority for allocating spectrum space is 
found at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 303(c) (1989).  This statutory provision 
allows the Commission to assign bands of frequencies and 
determine their power of operation.  Id.  Any unlicensed 
operation of a radio transmitter is a violation of § 301 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC § 301 (1982), and carries a 
maximum penalty of $10,000 or one year imprisonment.  47 U.S.C. § 
501 (1982). 

	The Commission's prohibition on the licensing of new FM 
stations operating at less than 100 watts ERP stems from a 1978 
Commission Report and Order (Docket 20735) which attempted to 
eliminate most Class D FM Educational Broadcast Stations 
operating at a minimum of 10 watts.  The Commissions's rationale 
for mandating a minimum broadcast signal of 100 watts for most 
Class D educational FM radio stations is found in the FCC's 1978 
Second Report and Order, entitled In The Matter of Changes in the 
Rules Relating to Noncommercial Educational FM Broadcast Stations 
69 F.C.C. 2d 240, 44 R.R. 2d 235 (1978), amended, 70 F.C.C. 2d 
972, 44 R.R. 2d 1685 (1979) (Hereafter, "Second Report and 
Order").  Prior to the Second Report and Order, Class D stations 
operated at 10 watts Effective Radiated Power (ERP), the lowest 
FM power licensed by the Commission.  Class D licenses were 
available only for noncommercial educational operation.  These 10 
watt stations were initially intended to serve limited broadcast 
areas such as college campuses and local communities.  The 
Commissions Second Report and Order sought to remove all low 
power Class D stations from the airwaves in the United States 
(excepting Alaska).  As a result, no new Class D applications may 
now be filed with the Commission.  47 CFR § 73.512(c) (1989).  


	Although 47 U.S.C. § 324 directs all broadcast stations to 
operate at the minimum power necessary, the Commission in their 
Second Report and Order raised the minimum effective radiated 
power of these Class D educational FM stations from 10 watts to 
100 watts.  The Commission cited three reasons for increasing the 
minimum ERP on these Class D stations:  technical efficiency, 
wider coverage, and better quality service.  Unfortunately, the 
implementation of the Second Report and Order completely failed 
to adequately accomplish any of these primary objectives.  See:  
Note, Educational FM Radio - the Failure of Reform, 34 Fed. Com. 
L.J. 432 (1982) (Hereafter, "Educational FM Radio").

	The Second Report and Order largely failed in meeting the 
Commission's goals because the methods used were not rationally 
related to the Commission's objective - creating additional space 
on the radio spectrum for high quality, high power educational 
broadcast outlets.  The rule change failed to achieve its goals 
in part because of the unrealistic approach of the proposal 
itself.  Educational FM Radio, supra, at 453.  In fact, the 
proposed rule changes were incapable from the start of ever 
attaining the goal set for them.  Id.  Because this rule was not 
narrowly tailored to allow for continued low power FM broadcasts 
where these broadcasts best suited the local community, it 
constitutes an abuse of discretion by the Commission and thus an 
unconstitutional abridgement of the right to communicate.  Once 
the failure of this policy was recognized, the Commission should 
have modified its rules in order to achieve the important and 
acknowledged goal of promoting broadcast diversity.  (cite Metro 
Broadcasting).

	The goal of the Commission's 1978 rule change was to create 
more space on the FM spectrum, thereby paving the way for more 
high-power "professional" educational FM stations.   The 
Commission sought to achieve this goal by eliminating all low-
power Class D stations from the educational band.  The Commission 
viewed these stations as an inefficient use of spectrum space 
because their coverage was limited to just a few miles.  However, 
given the goal of wider coverage, the insubstantial power boost 
resulting from an increase to a minimum power of 100 watts failed 
to justify the elimination of almost all 10 watt stations within 
the continental United States. 

	The Commission's assumption that higher-power stations make 
more efficient use of spectrum space than do multiple low-power 
stations was not so much a technical judgment as a value 
judgment.  The Commission's goal of more efficient use of the 
radio spectrum was ostensibly to make room for "higher quality" 
educational FM radio, with wider coverage for noncommercial 
educational broadcasts.  Second Report and Order, supra, at ___.  
However, rather than meeting these goals, the rule change instead 
had the opposite effect.  See: Educational FM Radio, supra, at 
451-52.  In fact, the Commission's rule change had the effect of 
forcing most 10 watt FM stations to increase their minimum power 
to 100 watts.  This mandatory power increase resulted in little 
or no eventual improvement in the quality of educational 
programming.  As a result, none of the Commission's three 
objectives (technical efficiency, wider coverage and better 
quality service) was ever achieved.

	First, rather than achieving greater technical efficiency by 
clearing up space on the FM spectrum, the Commission's Second 
Report and Order had the opposite effect of further crowding the 
spectrum.  While the Commission sought to add a number of new 
full service stations, this was premised on the elimination of 
most 10 watt Class D stations.  As outlined above, most of these 
Class D stations went on to become more powerful Class A 
stations.  Because few alternatives were available to Class D 
stations except the option of becoming high power Class A 
stations, the Commission in effect sought to ensure more 
efficient use of spectrum space by actually raising the minimum 
power of these stations.  This counter-intuitive solution to the 
perceived problem of spectrum scarcity reveals that the 
Commission's ban on low-power 10 watt FM stations was irrational 
and unreasonable given the overriding goals set forth in the 
Second Report and Order.  The net effect of the Commission's 
policy was to further crowd the airwaves.

	Secondly, the goal of attaining wider coverage by providing 
noncommercial educational radio to a larger percentage of the 
population was never achieved.  See: Educational FM Radio, supra, 
at ___.  While the Commission's 1978 rule change was intended to 
eliminate the number of 10 watt stations on the air, the ultimate 
effect was that most Class D stations applied for and became 
Class A status stations, broadcasting at a minimum power of 100 
watts.  In effect, this rule change merely increased the crowding 
of the spectrum without providing significant additional coverage 
or providing any room for newer, higher power professional 
stations.  In fact, the predicted distance in miles to the 60 
dbu  contour for a 10-watt stations is 12 miles, whereas the 
distance is only approximately 25 miles for a 100 watt station, 
and 40 miles for a 1,000 watt station.  Likewise, the 40 dbu 
contour for a 10 watt station would be reached at 40 miles, while 
this would be 53 miles for a 100 watt station and 70 miles at 
1,000 watts.  Thus, at the 40 dbu level, an increase in power 
from 10 watts to 100 watts would result in an increase in range 
of only 15 miles.  (All figures taken from Educational FM Radio, 
supra, at 434 n. 12).  Inevitably, the Commission's elimination 
of Class D educational stations worked "primarily to create a new 
class of minimum wattage Class A stations, providing only 
marginally wider coverage than the Class D stations which they 
replaced."  Educational FM Radio, supra, at 450.

	Finally, the goal of attaining a higher quality and larger 
quantity of high power professional stations was never achieved.  
Former Class D stations merely became Class A stations, with the 
same budget problems and high staff turnaround at stations 
affiliated with colleges and universities.  In addition, the 
assumption that Class D 10 watt stations failed to provide valid 
public service was little more than a subjective and elitist 
value judgment on the part of the Commission.  Although the 
Commission sought to enhance what it termed "cultural" or 
"educational" programming, the programming of local news, public 
affairs, free jazz, independent rock, world music on these local 
10 watt Class D stations was hardly any less "cultural" than the 
classical music and NPR newscasts typically preferred by most 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) affiliates.  See 
Educational FM Radio, supra, at 443.  In addition, while larger 
stations may have bigger budgets, this is no guarantee that their 
programming is more interesting, innovative or original than that 
of 10 watt stations with slender budgets.  In fact, 
"(p)rofessionally produced material may be pedantic or irrelevant 
while the product of less-equipped but more inspired staff can be 
bright and vital."  Id. at 444 n. 65, citing Petition of the 
Intercollegiate Broadcasting System, Docket 20735 (filed June 26, 
1972).  Indeed, the programming on 1-watt micro radio station 
Black Liberation Radio reveals that quality programming of 
political, cultural and educational material is possible with 
practically no budget whatsoever.  

	Perhaps the Commission could have followed a more rational 
approach of improving programming quality on educational stations 
by implementing public service programming requirements.  Merely 
requiring stations to broadacast at a power of 100 watts or more 
is no guarantee of improved program quality.  As one commentator 
noted:  
The (FCC's) solution also leaves unresolved the problem of 
quality.  Unresponsive stations will remain unresponsive 
regardless of power.  A station which provides inadequate 
educational service has no incentive to do otherwise at 100 
or 1,000 watts.  It may also be argued that as low-budget 
stations are forced to spend more money on their day-to-day 
operations, they will have even less to spend on 
programming.
Id. at 459-60.  Indeed, some broadcasting may best performed 
using limited facilities.  The Commission, in their Second Report 
and Order cited opposing arguments that maintained:
(l)imited power...is an appropriate way to reach a small 
community or a neighborhood which is a part of a larger city 
of license.  According to [these commentators], operation on 
a greater scale with substantial facilities could even bring 
about a separation of the station from its more limited 
community and thereby cause a loss of effective 
station/community dialogue and involvement."
	Second Report and Order, supra, at 245.  In fact, some 
smaller stations had argued to the Commission they had two or 
three times the audience of a local 50 Kw noncommercial station.  
Id. at 247.  Because a micro radio station is in even closer 
proximity to the local community, this provides further 
guarantees that a dialogue with that community may emerge.  Such 
a dialogue stemming from the practice of micro radio provides 
greater expressive diversity and furthers the possibilities of 
community self-determination.

	The Commission may still suggest other reasons why it 
supports restricting radio licenses to only those who can afford 
to broadcast at a minimum power of 100 watts.  However, these 
rationales are unpersuasive.  The Commission may argue it is 
insuring that listeners have regular and dependable radio 
service.  The Commission could claim that "home built" radio 
transmitters are not sufficiently dependable to provide regular 
and uninterrupted service.  However, as technology has improved 
in recent years this has become less of a concern.  Indeed, Black 
Liberation Radio has for the past several years operated a low-
cost broadcast operation which has effectively served the 
community on a regular and uninterrupted 24-hour basis.  If the 
Commission were to license some form of low power FM 
broadcasting, it could easily insure that proper equipment be 
used and maintained prior to issuing a license to broadcast.  A 
low power FM broadcasting system proposed several years ago in 
Canada required similar information within an uncomplicated 
licensing procedure.  See: Report and Recommendations in the Low 
Power Television Inquiry, BC Docket No. 78-253, Appendix 1.

	Additionally, the Commission may argue that only 
transmitters with closely regulated and predictable signal 
strength can be adequately evaluated and monitored by the FCC to 
avoid problems of interference.  However, listeners who find a 
neighborhood station's broadcasts irregular or of poor technical 
quality can easily tune to any mainstream commercial station.  
Furthermore, the Commission could develop new regulations for 
low-power radio and employ different monitoring techniques for 
neighborhood broadcasters.  Because of the low power signal of 
micro radio, broadcast interference would not constitute an 
insurmountable problem, and a uniform set of regulations 
regarding the operation of micro radio could prevent such 
interference from occurring.  

	The Commission may also argue that the national defense 
strategy, with regard to both military action and natural 
disasters, depends upon timely communication of emergency 
information to the entire broadcast audience.  The Commission 
might claim that a station not meeting FCC specifications cannot 
fulfill this role adequately.  Nevertheless, in the event of an 
emergency, low-power neighborhood stations could be required to 
broadcast repeated instructions for listeners to tune their 
radios to designated mainstream stations.  Again, such a 
regulation could be easily administered with micro radio 
broadcasters put on notice of such regulations through some 
notice procedure.  Furthermore, in an emergency, it may be 
necessary for members of a community to communicate on a local 
level.  Where larger transmitters are knocked off the air, as in 
an earthquake, micro radio broadcasts may enable members of a 
local community to quickly solicit emergency assistance as 
needed.  Precisely because of their low power requirements (micro 
radio signals may be broadcast using a backup battery generator) 
micro radio broadcasts would be especially vital in the event of 
such an emergency.  Again, regulations promulgated by the 
Commission could offer guidance as to when such broadcasts would 
be permitted.

	As the nearly uninterrupted operation of Black Liberation 
Radio has shown, micro radio provides a means for enhanced media 
diversity, thereby serving the public interest.  Given the above 
arguments, the rationale for reduced First Amendment protection 
of micro radio must fail.  Because no rational basis can support 
the elimination of micro radio broadcasts from the airwaves, any 
blanket prohibition on micro radio must be declared 
unconstitutional on its face. 


		F.	MICRO RADIO BROADCASTS MUST BE DISTINGUISHED 
FROM OTHER UNLICENSED BROADCASTS INVOLVING HIGH POWER 
TRANSMISSIONS WHICH THE COMMISSION SEEKS TO PROHIBIT. 

	Previous cases concerning unlicensed radio broadcasts have 
come before the courts.  However, these cases involved high-power 
broadcasts involving little political speech.  As such, these 
cases may be distinguished from the operation of Black Liberation 
Radio and other micro radio stations.  One such case, United 
States v. Weiner, 701 F.Supp. 14 (D.Mass. 1988), aff'd, 887 F.2d 
259 (1st Cir. 1989), involved a high power unlicensed broadcaster 
who made and lost a First Amendment claim in federal court.  [SEE 
APPENDIX 1].  Although the court in Weiner gave a cursory 
rejection to defendant's open forum and general First Amendment 
claims, the operation of Black Liberation Radio differs 
substantially from the facts in that case.  Most significantly, 
the district court in Weiner emphasized that Weiner would still 
"be able to apply for a broadcast license on this band," Id. at 
16.  The court also noted that the FCC regulations did "not 
necessarily permanently eliminate an opportunity for the 
defendants to broadcast at such time as when a license may be 
granted to them."  Id. at 17.  To the extent that FCC regulations 
permanently prevent Kantako from applying for a license because 
he is too poor and operates at too low an Effective Radiating 
Power (ERP), Mbanna Kantako's First Amendment rights are more 
seriously abridged by the Commission's action.
	
	The facts regarding the unauthorized offshore broadcasts of 
Reverend McIntire in United States v. McIntire also resemble 
those in Weiner.  The Reverend McIntire began transmitting radio 
broadcasts in September 1973 from a ship anchored three and one-
half miles off the coast of New Jersey.  These broadcasts were in 
response to FCC actions denying license renewal to WXUR-FM in 
Media, Pennsylvania based on fairness doctrine violations at that 
station.  (See:  United States v. McIntire, 365 F.Supp. 618, 620-
21 (D. NJ 1973); United States v. McIntire 28 R.R.2d 1000 (D.NJ 
1973); United States v. McIntire, 370 F.Supp. 1301 (D.NJ 1974); 
and United States v. McIntire, 29 R.R.2d 883 (D.NJ 1974).)  
McIntire's broadcasts operated "as a direct challenge" to the 
authority of the United States to restrict radio broadcasts 
originating beyond U.S. territorial limits.  United States v. 
McIntire, 29 RR 2d 883 (1974).  In addition, these broadcasts 
interfered with the frequencies of several licensed AM radio 
stations, specifically stations located in Salt Lake City, Utah 
and Lakewood, New Jersey.  United States v. McIntire, 365 F.Supp. 
618, 621 (D.NJ 1973).  Citing the International 
Telecommunications Convention as well as the overriding national 
interest in maintaining orderly use of the nation's airwaves, the 
court concluded that McIntire's broadcasts were adverse to the 
public interest.  United States v. McIntire, 29 RR2d 883, 885.  

	The maritime operation of unlicensed radio stations in 
Weiner and McIntire should be distinguished from the operation of 
Black Liberation Radio.  First, the Weiner and McIntire cases 
each focused primarily on the issue of FCC authority over 
broadcasts originating from international waters.  Black 
Liberation Radio's broadcasts are confined solely to an 
intrastate (indeed, intra-community) area traditionally beyond 
the regulatory grasp of the Commission's jurisdiction so long as 
no interference with interstate transmissions occurs.  
Furthermore, unlike those stations in McIntire or Weiner, Black 
Liberation Radio does not seek out a large audience, nor does it 
interfere with the signals of other licensed stations.  Finally, 
although the court in Weiner reaffirmed that defendant was still 
in a position to apply for a broadcast license were he to cease 
broadcasting, Kantako is unable to procure a license legally.  
Were Kantako to apply for a license to operate Black Liberation 
Radio, the Commission would categorically deny this request 
inasmuch as no provision allows for the licensing of low power 
one watt FM stations (See FCC Public Notice No. 14089, July 24, 
1991).  It is also impossible for Kantako or other members of his 
community to apply for any high power FM license inasmuch as 
members of this low income community lack the financial resources 
to operate a 100 watt FM station pursuant to FCC rules.  

G.	EVEN IF THE FCC MAY HAVE AUTHORITY TO SANCTION 
UNLICENSED 1 WATT RADIO BROADCASTS WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY 
INTERFERE OR ARE LIKELY TO INTERFERE WITH INTERSTATE 
BROADCASTS, ANY ORDERS TO CEASE AND DESIST ISSUED BY 
THE COMMISSION WITH RESPECT TO BLACK LIBERATION RADIO 
PURSUANT TO § 312(b) OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT ARE 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHERE THESE 
1 WATT BROADCASTS SERVE A NEGLECTED COMMUNITY AND OTHER 
REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE 
COMMISSION.

	The Commission's authority to order Black Liberation Radio 
to cease and desist pursuant to § 312(b) of the Communications 
Act is unconstitutional as an abuse of discretion where this 1 
watt micro radio station serves the public interest and other 
regulatory alternatives are available to the Commission.  
Authority for this assertion is found in C.J. Community Services, 
Inc. v. FCC, 15 R.R. 2029 (D.C. Cir. 1957).  Here the court held 
that the Commission was not required to issue a cease and desist 
order where unauthorized operation of an unlicensed booster 
station, which could cause some interference to authorized 
operations, broadcast television signals to the community of 
Bridgeport, Washington - a community which otherwise received no 
useable television signals.  Id. at ____ (emphasis added).  This 
unlicensed booster station transmitted "a usable signal to the 
town of Bridgeport, over a cone shaped area extending outward 
from the transmitter about 8 to 10 miles, or about 5 miles across 
at its widest point."  Id.  No application for licensing of this 
low power installation had been made, nor had the Commission 
issued a construction permit or license for the Bridgeport 
booster station.  Id.  In addition, no rules existed at the time 
for the licensed operation of such a booster station.  

	Initially, the Commission in C.J. Community Services, Inc. 
ordered defendants to cease and desist from operating "television 
broadcast stations" without a license and from carrying on such 
operation "without a person holding an appropriate operator's 
license."  Id.  Defendants then challenged the order, arguing 
that they were not subject to FCC jurisdiction, and that even if 
they were, the Commission, in the public interest, erred in 
failing to exercise discretion to permit operation.  Id.  On 
appeal, the Examiner initially held that the Commission's 
abatement of this unlicensed booster station was not in the 
public interest.  Id.  In his findings, the Examiner declared 
that: 
the utilization of radio channels...are not impaired or 
threatened by the television booster station hereinabove 
discussed, and no other substantial reasons support a 
conclusion that the public interest, convenience and 
necessity would be served by issuing the proposed cease and 
desist order.  
Id.  

	Although the Commission reversed the Examiner's conclusion 
that the cease and desist order "should" not issue, Id. at 2033, 
the D.C. Circuit court in C.J. Community Services later reversed 
the Commission's ruling.  On the issue of jurisdiction, the court 
did find that the Commission had authority to regulate this 
unlicensed booster station.  Id. at 2032.  Although the 
unlicensed booster station in Bridgeport was found to radiate an 
amplified broadcast signal which did not transmit detectable 
energy or communications beyond the border of that State, Id. at 
2030, jurisdiction was found because the booster station caused 
noticeable interference with the receptions of signals 
originating out-of-state.  Id. at 2035 (Washington, concurring).  
	Despite finding that the FCC had jurisdiction over this 
booster station, the court found that the Commission had ample 
discretion to withhold issuing a cease and desist order given 
this violation of the Act.  Id. at 2033.  The court observed that 
it was possible to telecast outside television signals into 
Bridgeport without objectionable interference.  The court then 
noted that with respect to § 318 of the Act (requiring a licensed 
operator at the station), that the Commission may, in the public 
interest, make special regulations governing the granting of 
licenses for the use of automatic radio devices and for their 
operation.  Id.  Finally, the Commission was found to have ample 
discretion in withholding a cease and desist order under § 312(c) 
of the Communications Act.  The court observed that under § 
312(c), the Commission may consider grounds offered by a "person 
involved" in a § 312(b) complaint as to "why...a cease and desist 
order should not be issued."  47 U.S.C. § 312(c) (1989) (cited in 
C.J. Community Services, supra, at 2033.  The court added that:
Clearly the Commission must weigh the circumstances, for 
Congress says that the cease and desist "shall" be issued 
only if it be decided that the order "should issue."  
Congress knew very well what it was saying.  It surely knew 
the difference between "should" and "shall."  
Id.  In remanding the case, the court noted the inequity of 
defendants being subject to a cease and desist order when the 
Commission had failed to provide an administrative mechanism 
through which a license may be procured given the public interest 
involved.  Id.  The concurring justice also noted that the 
Commission would have been better advised to ignore the existence 
of low-power stations such as this until such time as the 
Commission was prepared to deal with the station operators on 
some basis more equitable than mere repression.  Id. at 2035 
(Washington, concurring).

	In light of the court's ruling in C.J. Community Services, 
Inc., it is clear that the Commission has ample discretion in 
determining whether or not a cease and desist order should issue 
with respect to the operation of Black Liberation Radio.  As with 
Black Liberation Radio, no application for licensing of the low 
power Bridgeport booster station had been made, nor had the 
Commission issued a construction permit or license for the 
Bridgeport booster station.  Id.  Just as the Commission now 
prohibits all low power FM radio operations, the Rules and 
Standards at that time did not provide for the licensed operation 
of such a television booster station, nor did the rules allow for 
the issuance of such a license.  Id. at 2030-31.  Additionally, 
the low-cost amplifier in Bridgeport, which operated on a non-
profit basis, was in marked contrast with the authorized CATV 
system which was prohibitively expensive at a cost of $28,000 in 
1957.  Id. at 2030.  Similarly, the low power FM transmitter used 
by Black Liberation Radio is far less expensive to operate than a 
licensed Class D non-profit community radio station operating at 
a minimum 100 watts ERP.  The expense of running such an 
authorized station would be especially prohibitive given the 
stark economic poverty of the community encompassed by the John 
Hay Homes and East Springfield.  
	
	In C.J. Community Services, Inc. the court found that the 
unlicensed booster station served a compelling need in that it 
broadcast programming to an under-represented, under-served 
community.  The court's decision in C.J. Community Services, Inc. 
shows that when a licensing scheme egregiously fails to serve the 
needs of a community, it violates the law.  Because the 
Commission currently refuses to consider the operation of Black 
Liberation Radio within the context of an otherwise unserved 
community, its order that Black Liberation Radio cease and desist 
from all broadcast operations constitutes an abuse of discretion.  
Because the context surrounding Kantako's micro radio broadcasts 
differ significantly from that involving the high power 
unlicensed broadcasts in both Weiner and McIntire, those cases 
are inapplicable to the facts at hand.  Instead, C.J. Community 
Services, Inc. is controlling, as that case more closely 
parallels the facts surrounding the operation of Black Liberation 
Radio.  Like Bridgeport, residents of the John Hay Homes are 
unable to receive radio or television signals that directly 
address and serve the needs of this community.  Particularly in 
light of the social, political and cultural information broadcast 
over this station, the Commission must focus upon the needs of 
the community and the content of Black Liberation Radio's 
broadcasts in evaluating "why a cease and desist order should not 
be issued."  Id. at 2033.  As in C.J. Community Services, Inc., 
the court here must strive to achieve a fair and equitable 
result.  Such a result is particularly important given the First 
Amendment issues raised in this case, and inasmuch as "speech 
concerning public affairs...is the essence of self-government."  
Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 74-75 (1964).  

	Other cases involving waivers of FCC regulations are also 
relevant here.  In one case the Commission has waived allocation 
rules where the waiver would further the Commission's claimed 
policy of encouraging minority ownership and participation in 
broadcasting, as well as increase minority-oriented broadcast 
services, especially in areas with large minority populations.  
In Re Application of Por Favor, Inc., 68 F.C.C.2d 73, 74 (1978).  
The court in Por Favor found that a waiver was consistent with 
the Commission's stated policy of giving waiver requests a "hard 
look" based upon an applicant's minority ownership, management 
and programming.  Por Favor, supra at 74 (citing AM Station 
Assignment Standards (Docket No. 20265), 56 FCC 2d 6, 35 RR 2d 
151 (1975).  Similarly, in another case an appeal from a denial 
of waiver was remanded on the basis that an applicant's 
identification with minority listeners is a factor to be 
considered in acting upon requests for waivers of the 
Commission's technical requirements.  Garrett Broadcasting 
Services v. F.C.C., 168 U.S. App. D.C. 266, 513 F.2d 929 (1975).  
Finally, in Atlass Communications Inc., 61 FCC 2d 995, 39 RR2d 
228 (1976), the Commission granted a request for waiver by the 
licensee of a daytime only Black-owned, operated and Black 
oriented broadcast station to permit acceptance of its 
application for nighttime operation.  

	In each of the above cases, waivers of the Commission's 
licensing rules was granted in light of the minority-oriented 
services provided by the broadcaster.  In these cases, the 
Commission determined that the public interest would best be 
served by the grant of a waiver.  Given such precedent, a waiver 
of the existing FCC prohibition on 1 watt FM stations is also 
appropriate.  Such a waiver would be in the public interest, 
particularly in light of the minority community served by the 
broadcasts of Black Liberation Radio.  Other stations in the 
Springfield area have refused to broadcast similar political and 
cultural information, most likely out of a fear that such 
strident programming would alienate their mainstream listening 
audience, thereby lowering advertising revenues and leading to a 
loss of station income.  Furthermore, even though the information 
broadcast over Black Liberation Radio may be unpopular with some 
segments of the Springfield community, it is forbidden to 
discriminate against any broadcast outlet merely because of their 
unpopular content.  (cite early 1960s Supreme Court Pacifica 
case).  Given the facts herein described, § 318 of the 
Communications Act and the court's previous rulings as described 
above, the FCC has clearly abused its discretion in not issuing a 
waiver of rules prohibiting the unlicensed broadcasting of 1 watt 
FM stations where these low power broadcasts serve the public 
interest and little objectionable signal interference results.  


III.	THE COMMISSION'S PROHIBITION ON LICENSING OF LOW POWER FM 
MICRO RADIO BROADCASTS, AS APPLIED, CONSTITUTES A FORM OF 
PRIOR RESTRAINT AND THEREFORE IS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
ABRIDGEMENT OF FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS. 

	Restrictions on micro radio violate First Amendment 
principles where there is no valid justification for treating low 
power micro radio broadcasts differently from print media.  Thus, 
failure to license or otherwise permit micro radio broadcasts is 
unconstitutional where there is unused space on the radio 
spectrum and low power access to the airwaves produces no 
objectionable interferes with other radio signals.  
	
	Generally, any attempt to license a newspaper or magazine 
would violate the Constitution.  In Minneapolis Star and Tribune 
Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575 (1983) the 
Court overturned a statute requiring a special use tax for paper 
and ink.  Id. at 577-78.  The Court overturned this statute in 
part because it targeted the print media and raised the specter 
of licensing.  Id. at 582-83.  Additionally, only an 
extraordinary government interest may be used to justify any 
prior restraint on the publication of any print media.  See New 
York Times v.United States (Pentagon Papers case), 403 U.S. 713 
(1971) (per curiam).  However, because the airwaves are 
historically claimed to be a "scarce" resource, broadcast media 
are generally accorded less protection from government regulation 
than print media.  Section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934 
expressly states that "...No person shall use or operate any 
apparatus for the transmission of energy or communications or 
signals by radio...except under and in accordance with this Act 
and with a license in that behalf granted under provision of this 
Act."  47 U.S.C. § 301 (1989).  In addition, Justice Frankfurter 
has stated in National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 US 
190, (1943) that, "The right of free speech does not include, 
however, the right to use the facilities of radio without a 
license."  Id. at 227.  

	In National Broadcasting Co., the Court held that the 
licensing system established by Congress in the Communications 
Act of 1934 was a proper exercise of its power over commerce.  
Id.  Historically, the Court has justified FCC jurisdiction over 
the airwaves by focusing upon the need to regulate scarce 
broadcast frequencies.  In National Broadcasting Co., the Court 
noted that "(u)nlike other modes of expression, radio inherently 
is not available to all.  That is its unique characteristic, and 
that is why, unlike other modes of expression, it is subject to 
government regulation."  Id. at 226.  Twenty-six years later, the 
Court again used the scarcity rationale, noting that even with 
advances in radio technology, demand for space on the spectrum 
had grown to the point where not all demands on the spectrum 
could ever be satisfied.  Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 
U.S. 367, 388-90 (1969).

	Typically, those alleging a scarcity of available radio 
frequencies point to the "chaos" that reigned over the airwaves 
prior to the passage of the Federal Radio Act of 1927.  During 
this unregulated era, radio broadcasts frequently intruded upon 
the signals of other stations, producing interference and static 
over the airwaves.  See, e.g.,  National Broadcasting Co. v. 
United States, 319 U.S. 190, 212 (1943); Red Lion, supra, at 375-
86; FCC v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 474 
(1940).  However, the justification for regulating airwave 
broadcasts based upon this scarcity theory has recently undergone 
significant criticism.  See, e.g.,  Spitzer, The 
Constitutionality of Licensing Broadcasters, 64 NYU LR 990 
(1989).  Former FCC chairman Mark Fowler also rejected scarcity 
justifications for regulating broadcasting as the FCC pursued a 
policy of deregulation under his tenure.  See: Fowler & Brenner, 
A Marketplace Approach to Broadcast Regulation, 60 Tex. L. Rev. 
207 (1982).  Furthermore, the Supreme Court observed that the 
prevailing rationale for broadcast regulation based on spectrum 
scarcity has come under increasing criticism in recent years.  
F.C.C. v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 376 n. 11 (1984).  
In League of Women Voters, the Supreme Court explicitly invited 
Congress or the FCC to rule that technological developments have 
advanced so far that some revision of the system of broadcast 
regulation may be required.  Id.  Indeed, other nations have 
developed successful alternative methods of broadcast spectrum 
allocation which successfully permit low power micro radio 
broadcasts.  These methods include Canada's experiments with 1 
watt low power FM broadcasts and the results of an early 1980s 
Italian Supreme Court decision holding regulation of local 
broadcasting by the national government to be unconstitutional.  
In both instances, low power FM broadcasts were permitted with 
little resulting chaos or interference with emergency or other 
governmental services.  Nevertheless, the Commission still 
maintains 
that spectrum scarcity should be irrelevant for First 
Amendment purposes does not affect its relevance to the 
Commissions allocational and licensing function.  The 
Commission, of necessity, considers spectrum scarcity in 
making its allocational and licensing decisions.
	Syracuse Peace Counsel, 2 F.C.C. Rec 5043, 5069 n.204 
(1987).  

	However, today even the Commission acknowledges that the 
spectrum scarcity rationale has lost much of its credence and 
viability as justification for FCC regulation of broadcasting 
content.  See, Id.  As a consequence, the FCC should be estopped 
from justifying its failure to license low power radio broadcasts 
with these same spectrum scarcity justifications.  Micro radio 
broadcasters use only a fraction of the radio spectrum to 
transmit a high quality signal heard within a distance of 
approximately one mile from the transmitter.  An appendix to the 
Commission's own Report and Recommendations in the Low Power 
Television Inquiry (BC Docket No. 78-253) focused upon Canada's 
experiments with low power FM transmitters.  This study indicated 
that
these very low power systems do not create interference or 
spectrum crowding problems, provided they are operated with 
certain basic safeguards against interference to other 
services and that they provide a valuable local service.  
The major quality limitation is in the "programming itself", 
not the transmitter....  We recommend that the transmitter 
power of such VLPT's [very low power transmitters] be 
limited to one watt.  This power level is capable of 
providing an adequate service to the small, remote 
communities in which such service applications are likely to 
arise.
	Id. (Executive Summary and Recommendations).

	Broadcasters who transmit micro-radio signals within their 
respective communities do not lay claim to a broad section of 
radio frequency.  The communicative intent of micro-radio 
broadcasters such as Mbanna Kantako is to maintain a dialogue 
with those in the immediate community; listeners located 
approximately one mile from the micro-radio broadcaster's signal.  
As the appendix to the FCC's Report and Recommendations 
indicated, "Some communities are not satisfied with local 
rebroadcast of programs originating outside the community and 
want the technical means to originate programming locally 
according to local determination of need and interest."  Id.  In 
the case of Mbanna Kantako's Black Liberation Radio, this 
community constitutes 98% of the African-American population in 
the extremely segregated capital of Springfield, Illinois.  

	Again, it should be noted that Kantako's micro radio 
broadcasts have caused no interference with other radio signals, 
nor impaired any governmental functions.  However, while the 
technological feasibility of micro radio allows for low-cost 
instant communication involving important First Amendment issues, 
the FCC makes no provision for the utilization of this 
technology, thereby ignoring the potential of micro-radio in 
advancing the public interest, the Commission's public mandate 
under the Communications Act.  This is in contrast to the 
Commission's own policy statements.  The Commission has 
previously stated "(t)hat principles applicable to the 
government's regulation of a rapidly changing industry such as 
telecommunications should be revisited and revised in light of 
technological advances is not an unusual proposition."  Syracuse 
Peace Council, 2 FCC Rec. 5043, 5052 (1987).  In Red Lion 
Broadcasting the Supreme Court agreed, noting that advances in 
technology could have an effect on the judicial analysis of the 
constitutional principles applicable to the electronic media.  
Red Lion Broadcasting, at ____.  In addition, the Court of 
Appeals in Meredith v. FCC noted that the Red Lion decision "was 
expressly premised on the scarcity of broadcast frequencies 'in 
the present state of commercially available technology' as of 
1969."  (cite).  And yet, the Commission itself later allocated 
almost 700 additional stations to the FM band since that time.  
See: Modification of FM Broadcast Station Rules to Increase the 
Availability of Commercial FM Broadcast Assignments, 53 RR 2d 
1550 (1983).  In addition, a recent bill passed by Congress would 
have increased the amount of electromagnetic spectrum available 
to broadcasters, again decreasing the validity of the spectrum 
scarcity rationale.  H.R. 2965, would have reallocated a portion 
of the spectrum previously reserved for government use.  (FIND 
SUBSEQUENT HISTORY!!!). 

	In Appendix 1 of the FCC's Report and Recommendations in the 
Low Power Television Inquiry (BC Docket No. 78-253) (1980?) are 
comparative documents which detail Canada's positive experiences 
with low-power broadcasting.  In a report entitled "A Study of 
Very Low Power TV and FM Transmitters for Remote Communities" the 
authors suggest that rules be amended to allow for a sub-class of 
very low power FM broadcasting stations with Effective Radiating 
Power (ERP) up to 10 watts, which would typically use a 
transmitter power of about 1 watt.  To avoid interference, the 
report suggests that:
the principle technical limitation on such operations should 
be a requirement that a suitable channelizing or low pass 
filter be used to limit radiation of harmonics which could 
be harmful to nearby television or other telecommunications 
services....  We would recommend limitation of harmonic 
radiation because of the possibility of interference to 
television services in the same or nearby communities.  It 
is likely that CATV class FM modulators and power amplifiers 
would be used in such service.

	Id. at 21.  The report goes on to state that:

[Very low power transmitters] for FM radio should have 
effective means of reliably maintaining frequency stability.  
This stability need not be the 1 KHz required [in Canada] of 
full scale FM broadcast transmitters but could be relaxed to 
as much as 100 KHz without any harm being done, so long as 
there is assurance of effective limitation of radiation that 
might affect other services.

	Id. at 49.  Furthermore, the report adds that:

We expect few problems with the quality of the overall 
service in locally originated very low power FM radio 
services.  Audio equipment of good quality is not expensive 
and the licensees of such stations should not have the kind 
of problems which face TV operations in similar 
circumstances.  Good quality microphones are substantially 
less than $100 in cost.  Good quality audio tape recorders 
can be purchased for a very few hundred dollars.  Monitoring 
and audio control equipment is similarly reasonably priced.  
Acceptable quality is so much easier and cheaper to achieve 
in radio than in television we expect the [Canadian Radio 
and Television Commission] may wish to consider 
encouragement of local community radio as a precursor to 
[low power] television in communities in which expression of 
local interests is the principle reason for new low power 
broadcast services.  Radio is very cost effective - "more 
bang for the buck."  
	
	Id. at 22.

	The FCC would have little trouble in regulating micro radio 
broadcasting stations.  In Appendix 1 to the Commission's Report 
and Recommendations focusing on low power television is the 
Canadian Department of Communications' study of very low power FM 
transmitters, which recommended that application forms and 
required information be simple enough to allow for easy 
application by potential low power licensees.  Id. at 50.  
Samples of such applications were included, along with rules 
governing broadcasts on low power micro radio stations.  This 
information is included here as Exhibit 1 (see attached).  These 
forms request operational information (name of licensee, address, 
etc.), technical information (frequency/channel, antenna 
location, type of equipment, etc.) information concerning the 
community being served, and statements as to how operation of a 
low power transmitter will serve the needs of this community.  A 
cursory examination of Exhibit 1 indicates that the licensing and 
administrative requirements necessary to oversee operation of 
micro radio stations are not burdensome.  Indeed, these licensing 
forms reveal that micro radio can easily be regulated so as to 
prevent signal interference, and that rules which prohibit the 
operation of micro radio where there is a compelling need are an 
arbitrary exercise of the Commission's powers which fail to 
advance the public interest.

	Given the limited broadcast radius of micro radio and the 
fact that this technology enables citizens to broadcast over open 
radio frequencies with no objectionable interference with 
licensed broadcast signals, the FCC should adopt policies that 
would foster such use.  Because access to politically and 
culturally relevant micro radio broadcasts is in the public 
interest, and because the Court has emphasized that it is the 
right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the 
broadcasters, which is paramount, FCC rules prohibiting access to 
micro radio broadcasts unconstitutionally impairs the First 
Amendment rights of micro radio broadcasters such as Mbanna 
Kantako along with their community of listeners.
		


IV. 	THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ESTOPPED FROM PROHIBITING BLACK 
LIBERATION RADIO'S BROADCASTS IN THAT THESE BROADCASTS HAVE 
BEEN TACITLY PERMITTED BY THE GOVERNMENT SINCE APRIL 1989.

	Mbanna Kantako began broadcasting community-oriented radio 
programs over a one-watt FM radio station from his apartment on 
November 23, 1988.  On April 5, 1989 a representative of the FCC 
ordered Kantako to cease broadcasting.  Kantako complied with the 
FCC order for 11 days, until April 17, 1989, when he again 
resumed broadcasting.  The FCC ultimately brought this matter 
before a Federal Judge to obtain a judgment against Kantako in 
the amount of $750.  Kantako's request for an attorney was 
refused on the grounds that the FCC violation involved a civil, 
not a criminal, penalty.  Kantako consequently refused to 
participate in any further proceedings and judgment was issued 
against him for $750.  

	Mbanna Kantako resumed broadcasting on April 17, 1989.  
Black Liberation Radio has continued to operate since that date, 
despite the outstanding $750 fine ordered by the Federal courts.  
Although Kantako attempted to have the Springfield police arrest 
him for illegal broadcasting, they refused.  When they declined, 
Kantako went to the Federal Building in downtown Springfield, 
where he was again refused arrest.  All other attempts to get 
arrested have also been refused.  Although the FCC issued another 
shutdown order on March 30, 1990, Kantako has continued to 
broadcast with no governmental interference.

	Because of Kantako's continued uninterrupted broadcasts, the 
Commission must be estopped from shutting down Black Liberation 
Radio for subsequent political speech... [cite Estoppel 
arguments; see Watkins, etc.]


V.	FINANCIAL QUALIFICATIONS WHICH COMPLETELY EXCLUDE THE POOR 
FROM THE USE OF THE FM BAND OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM 
ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL; THEREFORE FCC ACTIONS TAKEN PURSUANT 
TO § 308(B) OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT WHICH EXCLUDE THE POOR 
ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON THEIR FACE.


	The Commission requires that applicants for new radio 
broadcast stations demonstrate the ability to construct and 
operate the station for three months, without relying upon 
advertising or other revenue to meet these costs.  Financial 
Qualifications standards of aural broadcast applicants, 69 F.C.C. 
2d 407 (1978).  The Commission has alleged that this policy would 
specifically benefit minority applicants seeking entry into the 
radio broadcast service inasmuch as station financing has been a 
principal barrier to minority broadcast ownership.  Id.  
Nevertheless, the Commission's financial requirements are 
discriminatory on their face because they prevents the poor from 
exercising a fundamental right - the right to freedom of 
expression as guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Furthermore, 
the application of this financial barrier works to discriminate 
against minorities who lack the $50,000 to $100,000 necessary to 
operate a station at a loss for three consecutive months.  This 
is particularly true of micro radio broadcasters such as Mbanna 
Kantako who are denied access to the airwaves despite their 
ability to engage in effective low-cost radio programming.  As a 
result, the Commission's rule denies underrepresented poor and 
minority communities any effective voice over the broadcast 
media, thereby violating their right to impart and receive 
communication over the public airwaves.

	In a variety of contexts the Supreme Court has made clear 
that the disabilities of indigency need not be overcome by 
government, see e.g. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980) 
(abortion funding), Ross v. Moffit, 417 U.S. 600 (1974) (criminal 
justice).  Thus, neither the right to welfare, Dandridge v. 
Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970), housing, Lindsey v. Normet, 405 
U.S. 56 (1972), or education, San Antonio Independent School 
District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), constitutes a 
fundamental constitutional right.  But it is equally true that it 
is forbidden for government to exclude a person because of 
indigency from the exercise of a fundamental constitutional 
right.  Thus while a person's lack of resources may limit a 
person's ability to travel interstate, it cannot limit the right 
to travel, Edwards v. California, 314 U.S. 160 (1941), or the 
right to vote, Kramer v. Union Free School District, 395 U.S. 621 
(1969), or to be a candidate in an election to public office, 
Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134 (1972), Lubin v. Panish, 415 U.S. 
709 (1974).

	The same principle is applicable to the First Amendment.  
The complete exclusion of the poor from a First Amendment forum 
because of government criteria which make the exclusion turn on 
qualifications of wealth offends the principles of equality on 
which the constitutional administration of any First Amendment 
forum depend.   Carey v. Brown, [cite...], Police Department of 
Chicago v. Mosley, [cite...].  Because of its essential 
connection to the political process the First Amendment is called 
"the matrix . . . of nearly every other form of freedom," 
(Cardozo, J. in Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937)), and 
freedom of communication cannot be compromised without 
compromising every other right.   All groups in the community 
depend on the First Amendment to make their interests known and 
to shape them into law; if any group is excluded then they are to 
that extent excluded from the law making process.  Plainly speech 
is essential to self-government and a polity excludes the poor 
from a public forum at its peril. 


	Moreover dignity for the common person today depends on his 
or her ability to decide for him or herself the merits of every 
public issue, and there can be no deliberation or judgment 
without freedom of communication.  Governmental exclusion of the 
poor from a forum as decisive as radio because of indigency 
constitutes an official assault on their social and political 
worth as members of the community and on their dignity as 
citizens. 

	Historically the First Amendment was adopted to eliminate 
financial qualifications for speech.  John Adams wrote that the 
Stamp Act imposed on the American colonies by Britain showed "a 
design . . . to strip us, in a great measure, of the means of 
knowledge, by loading the press, the colleges, and even an 
almanac and a newspaper, with restraints and duties," (quoted 
from "Our Blood-Bought Liberty" in Neisser, "Charging for Free 
Speech: User Fees and Insurance in the Marketplace of Ideas," 74 
Georgetown L. J. 257 (198_).  In fact the Stamp Act was first 
introduced in England in the early 17th century after Parliament 
refused to renew the Licensing Act to serve a similar purpose.  
The Crown frankly acknowledged that the purpose of the Licensing 
Act was not to raise revenue but to suppress writings critical of 
the government.  The Anti-Federalist challenge to the 
ratification of the Constitution was conscious of this history 
and insisted on a Bill of Rights to prevent government from  
"imposing duties on every instrument of writing."  Neisser 
concludes:
  
English suppression of religious, political, and literary 
dissidents evolved from book-burning, to licensing, to 
taxing.  Taxes on paper, publications, and advertisements 
were intended as a means of suppressing critics once 
licensing was no longer politically acceptable, and these 
taxes effectively suppressed the inexpensive mass 
circulation publications.  The Framers were acutely aware of 
the risks of taxation of expression . . . .   Furthermore, 
the Founders did not enact such taxes after the First 
Amendment was adopted.

	The current Court has confirmed this heritage in Minneapolis 
Star and Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 103 U.S. 
1365 (1983), invalidating a Minnesota use tax on the press.  This 
case reaffirms the principle that financial burdens cannot be 
made a governmentally imposed prerequisite to the exercise of 
First Amendment rights.  The potential for abuse, the Court 
reasoned, was too severe.

	In spite of this history, § 308(b) of the Communications Act 
of 1934 provides that: 
All applications for station licenses, or modifications or 
renewals thereof, shall set forth such facts as the 
Commission by regulation may prescribe as to the 
citizenship, character, and financial, technical, and any 
other qualifications of the applicant to operate the station 
. . .
Given the nature of any public forum, perhaps those with 
financial ability may be subject to fees to a limited extent.  
See, e.g., Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569 (1941).  However, 
financial qualifications can no more be made a governmental 
precondition to the use of a First Amendment forum than they can 
be made a precondition to candidacy for public office.  See, 
Lubin v. Panish, [cite...] and Bullock v. Carter, [cite...].  For 
this reason ordinances requiring a threshold percentage of 
contribution to be used for charitable purposes as a precondition 
to solicitation in the public forum, have been invalidated.  See, 
Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 
U.S. 620 (1980), Secretary of State v. Joseph H. Munson, Co., 467 
U.S. ___ (1984), and Riley v. National Association for the Blind, 
487 U.S. 781 (1988).  Such provisions may foreclose solicitation 
by those without funds to defray the administrative cost of the 
activity.  Similarly rules and regulations imposed under § 308(b) 
of the Communications Act foreclose the possibility of any 
applicant receiving a license without tens of thousands of 
dollars of capital as an absolute minimum, and station licenses 
are commonly marketed for millions.  Yet broadcasters like Mbanna 
Kantako have shown that effective use of the spectrum can be made 
without an eye to profit and as a form of community expression 
for as little as a few hundred dollars.  Government forbids this, 
not because of interference with existing users or because 
spectrum space is unavailable, but because micro radio 
broadcasters lack sufficient capital to meet the FCC's threshold 
requirements.  

	One need not be as sensitive as the Founding Fathers to the 
conditions underpinning the struggle for liberty to suspect that 
communication mergers priced at $370 million (Gannet-Combined), 
$3.5 billion (Capital Cities-ABC), and $6 billion (GE-RCA) (see, 
Carter, Franklin and Wright, The First Amendment and the Fifth  
Estate, p. 176-78) generate broadcasters with a stake in the 
established order, in its assumptions and values, and in its 
distribution of wealth and power.  See also, Bagdikian, "Lords of 
the Global Village," The Nation, June 12, 1989 at __.  As Justice 
Brennan once noted:
[I]n light of the strong interest of broadcasters in 
maximizing their audience, and therefore their profits, it 
seems almost naive to expect the majority of broadcasters to 
produce the variety and controversiality of material 
necessary to reflect a full spectrum of viewpoints.  Stated 
simply, angry customers are not good customers and in the 
commercial world of mass communications, it is simply "bad 
business" to espouse - or even to allow others to espouse - 
the heterodox or the controversial.  As a result, even under 
the [now disregarded] Fairness Doctrine, broadcasters 
generally tend to permit only established - or at least 
moderated - views to enter the broadcast world's 
"marketplace of ideas."  Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. 
Democratic National Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 187-88 (1973) 
(Brennan, dissenting).
Under the First Amendment, existing broadcast licensees have a 
right to turn wealth to speech.  But the same First Amendment 
must assure popular critics of government without such resources 
a place in the forum also.  It cannot add to the influence of 
wealth the trump of official exclusion.  Mbanna Kantako and other 
micro radio practitioners are today's popular pamphleteers, 20th 
century dissidents whose imaginative and resourceful use of small 
means is suppressed by government imposition of financial 
qualifications.  General Electric could buy this equipment for 
one ten-millionth of the cost of RCA  and still overpay.  Must 
the Commission and the Department of Justice also prevent this 
speech?  Congress and the FCC may make reasonable rules to govern 
the FM band just as government may do with any First Amendment 
forum for which it has responsibility, but it may not exclude 
Mbanna Kantako from that forum by making financial qualifications 
a precondition to access.  


VI. 	WHERE UNUSED SPECTRUM SPACE EXISTS, FCC RULES WHICH 
EXCLUDE A BROADCASTER WITHOUT FUNDS ARE 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THAT THEY ARE NEITHER NARROWLY 
DRAWN NOR GROUNDED IN A COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL 
INTEREST. 
	Because broadcast frequencies are considered a scarce 
resource, the Supreme Court in 1983 did not apply a "compelling 
governmental interest" standard to government regulation of the 
editorial content of a licensed broadcaster.  Nevertheless, the 
Court applied a scrutiny only marginally less exacting and found 
a Congressional prohibition on editorializing by noncommercial 
broadcast licensees to violate the First Amendment, FCC v. League 
of Women Voters, [cite...].  But because the Constitution does 
not permit the total exclusion of the poor from the exercise of a 
fundamental constitutional right because of indigency, the 
highest standard of strict scrutiny must be applied to test any 
such restrictions, as Kramer v. Union Free School District, 
supra, and Carey v. Brown, supra, for example, require.  The 
standard of strict judicial scrutiny of governmental activity 
requires that governmental action be designed to accomplish a 
compelling governmental interest and that the means chosen to 
accomplish that interest be narrowly drawn for that purpose. 

	By any standard the government can demonstrate neither a 
compelling interest nor a carefully chosen means to justify the 
total exclusion of the poor from the FM band of the 
electromagnetic spectrum.  The justification for regulation of 
the First Amendment fora created by the broadcast spectrum is the 
potential for broadcast interference and the scarcity of 
broadcast frequencies, National Broadcasting Company v. United 
States, 319 U.S. 190 (1943), Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 
supra, FCC v. League of Women Voters, supra.  Yet Kantako's one 
watt station interferes with no broadcast use.  The FCC did not 
take action against Mbanna Kantako because of interference with 
any other broadcaster.  His broadcast displaced no licensee, 
caused no cacophony, no anarchy.  While a small potential for 
interference may exist, micro radio broadcasters are by 
definition those who broadcast with very meager resources, and 
with broadcast capabilities quite limited in their ability to 
intrude on broadcast space.  In addition, there are vast regions 
of the United States where for mile after mile substantial 
portions of the FM band are unused, yet the poor are denied 
access to these frequencies also.  There can be no justification 
for such exclusions. 

	Nor are such exclusions narrowly drawn.   In any 
consideration of the relationship of means to ends, there must 
inevitably be an evaluation of alternatives.  Narrow is a 
relative term and depends on available comparisons.  Here, 
penalties may be imposed for actual interference, or in the 
alternative, and under the compulsion of the Constitution, a 
portion of the forum may be set aside for the indigent, thereby 
avoiding all possibility of interference with other licensees.  
Such space exists.  In 1984 the FM band was expanded with nearly 
700 new stations added.  See: Modification of FM Broadcast 
Station Rules to Increase the Availability of Commercial FM 
Broadcast Assignments, 53 RR 2d 1550 (1983).  A portion of such 
space might be made available to the poor.  These are matters 
readily within the discretion and expertise of the Commission 
once Constitutional guidelines prohibiting government exclusion 
because of indigency have been unambiguously announced.

	The Court in Red Lion stated over 20 years ago that "if 
experience with the administration of these doctrines [the 
fairness doctrine] indicates that they have the net effect of 
reducing rather than enhancing the volume and quality of 
coverage, there will be time enough to reconsider the 
constitutional implications."  Red Lion, supra, at ___.  But 
there has been time enough to know that the poor are excluded 
from the spectrum.  As a result, a portion of the radio spectrum 
must be set aside to allow this class to engage in meaningful 
dialogue over the airwaves.  Only in this way can the First 
Amendment rights of this class of persons be properly protected.


VII.	THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE 
UNITED STATES ARE UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VIOLATED BY FINANCIAL 
QUALIFICATIONS WHICH COMPLETELY EXCLUDE THE POOR FROM THE 
USE OF THE FM BAND OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM PURSUANT 
TO SECTION 308(B) OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT.  IN PARTICULAR, 
BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF HISTORICAL PATTERNS AND PRACTICES 
OF THE FCC WHICH DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MINORITIES.

	Besides discriminating against the poor, the Commission's 
suppression of micro radio discriminates against minority 
broadcasters and listeners.  Because FCC regulations prohibiting 
the operation of micro radio have a disproportionately adverse 
affect on broadcasting diversity, these provisions 
unconstitutionally impair the rights of minorities to engage in 
their fundamental rights of free expression.

	The Supreme Court now proclaims that the applicable test for 
constitutionality under the equal protection clause is as 
follows:  
(O)fficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely 
because it results in a racially disproportionate impact....  
Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is 
required to show a violation of the Equal Protection 
Clause....  Once racial discrimination is shown to have been 
a "substantial" or "motivating" factor behind enactment of 
the law, the burden shifts to the law's defenders to 
demonstrate that the law would have been enacted without 
this factor.	
	Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 227-28 (1985) (quoting 
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 
264-65 (1977)).  However, even under this more stringent test, 
the Commission's behavior with respect to minority broadcasters 
has consistently reflected the "substantial" goal of racial 
discrimination.  In particular, the Commission's policy towards 
micro radio ratifies previous discriminatory behavior by the 
Commission, and prevents African American broadcasters such as 
Mbanna Kantako from communicating with their respective 
communities.  See, L. Rodriguez, "Rappin' in the Hood," The 
Nation, 193, Aug. 12/19, 1991 (detailing harassment of other 
African-American micro radio broadcasters).  A brief history of 
the Commission's pattern and practice of discriminatory behavior 
is described here in order to provide the context within which 
FCC prohibitions against micro radio operate.


	A.	FCC AND RACISM IN BROADCAST REGULATION 

[SEGMENTS OF TEXT COPIED FROM "COMMENTS OF NAACP AND LULAC," GC 
DOCKET NO. 92-52]

	In perhaps no other task is the Commission's public interest 
mandate more fundamental than in the issuance of new broadcast 
licenses.  This is the means by which non-minorities, 
exclusively, won the rights to the most valuable licenses 
essentially without cost at a time when legal segregation still 
reigned.  During that time, it would have been unthinkable for 
minorities to have had the temerity even to apply for a broadcast 
permit.  To understand why, some historical context is necessary.  
The NAACP and LULAC have previously observed that:
Until about the mid-1970s, the FCC openly tolerated and 
ratified discriminatory action by its licensees.  It 
routinely provided broadcast licenses to colleges and 
universities which were totally segregated (eg., WBKY-FM, 
University of Kentucky, licensed in 1941; WUNC-FM, 
University of North Carolina, licensed in 1952; KUT-FM, 
University of Texas, licensed in 1957, among many others).  
In this way, the FCC endorsed and facilitated segregated 
broadcast education, thereby giving Whites a substantial 
headstart in access to broadcast employment.
	
Southland Television Co., 10 RR 699 (decided 1955, reported 
1957), recon. denied, 20 FCC 159 (1955) illustrates the 
Commission's racial policies at mid-century.  The FCC had 
before it a Shreveport TV station applicant who segregated 
movie theatres.  This man had built his movie theatres 
without balconies to circumvent a Louisiana law which 
allowed the admission of Blacks as long as they sat in the 
balconies.  He even owned a segregated drive-in theater; all 
the other drive-ins were integrated (at least as to 
admission, although not as to the occupants of the 
automobiles).

The FCC held that it lacked evidence that "any Louisiana 
theatres admit Negroes to the first floor" of theatres, nor 
any evidence that "such admission would be legal under the 
laws of the state."  Id., 10 RR2d at 750.  Thus, the FCC 
gave full faith and credit to state segregation laws and to 
broadcasters' deliberate efforts to evade even the weakest 
state laws permitting some integration.
	
Comments of NAACP and LULAC, 6-7, GC Docket No. 92-52, dated June 
2, 1992.

	When faced with broadcast cases arising out of the civil 
rights movement, the FCC's decisions also reflected a continuing 
pattern of discriminatory policies and practices:
In Broward County Broadcasting, 1 RR2d 294, 296 (1963), the 
Commission set for hearing the license of a small Florida 
station which proposed to address a small portion (17%) of 
its programming to the Black community.  The reason:  local 
White citizens had complained that the station was licensed 
to an all-White town which didn't need that type of music.  
When the station dropped the programming, the FCC quietly 
dropped the charges.
	
Two years later, in The Columbus Broadcasting Company, Inc., 
40 FCC 641 (1965), the Commission was faced with a radio 
licensee who had used his station to help incite the riot 
which took place at the University of Mississippi when James 
Meredith attempted to enroll.  The Commission merely 
admonished the station.
	
The Federal courts soon became impatient with the FCC's 
racist policies.  In the landmark case of Office of 
Communication of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, 359 
F.2d 994 (D.C. Cir. 1966) ("UCC I") the Court of Appeals 
ordered the FCC to hold a hearing on the license renewal of 
a Jackson, Mississippi station, WLBT-TV, which only 
broadcast the White Citizens Council/Ku Klux Klan viewpoint 
on racial matters, and went so far as to censor its own NBC 
network news feeds with a "Sorry, Cable Trouble" sign when 
NAACP General Counsel Thurgood Marshall was being 
interviewed.  This case was highly significant because it 
upheld, for the first time, the principle that individual 
citizens, because of their investment in television and 
radio receivers, have standing to challenge television and 
radio licenses.
After a very one-sided hearing in which the FCC renewed 
WLBT-TVs license again, the Court ordered the FCC to deny 
the license renewal.  The Court has never before or since 
taken such an action, but this time it held the 
administrative record to be "beyond repair."  Office of 
Communication of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, 425 
F.2d 543 (D.C. Cir. 1969) ("UCC II").  Only after a further 
hearing lasting eleven more years, a company headed by Aaron 
Henry, President of the Mississippi State Conference of 
[NAACP?] Branches, won the license.

	Comments of NAACP and LULAC, 7-8, GC Docket No. 92-52, dated 
June 2, 1992.

	The NAACP and LULAC have observed that in spite of an anti-
discrimination policy adopted by the FCC, the Commission applied 
this policy only haltingly and sporadically:
In Chapman Television and Radio Co., 24 FCC2d 282 (1970), 
the FCC had before it an applicant for Birmingham, Alabama 
TV Channel 21.  That applicant, a man who owned part of the 
stock in a Birmingham cemetery, had participated in the 
cemetery's 1954 decision to exclude Blacks.  The cemetery's 
policy came to light when the cemetery turned away the body 
of a Black war hero.  Yet the Commission found "extenuating 
circumstances" in the applicant's claim that the cemetery 
would have been sued by White cemetery plot owners.   The 
FCC ordered hearing only into why the applicant had covered 
the matter up, not into whether a practicing segregationist 
had the moral character to be a federal licensee.  Even the 
cover-up allegations were thrown out by the Hearing 
Examiner, who held that "in today's climate it is not at all 
an oddity for political leadership to appear to buckle 
before irresponsible and only half true racism charges."  
Chapman Radio and Television Co., 21 RR2d 887, 895 (Examiner 
1971).

Chapman was not an anachronism.  Long before minorities 
owned or applied for broadcast licenses, the FCC openly 
discriminated on the basis of national origin.  In 1938, in 
what would now be seen as a clear violation of the First 
Amendment, the Commission rejected the only applicant for a 
radio license, holding that "the need for equitable 
distribution of [radio] facilities throughout the country is 
too great to grant broadcast station licenses for the 
purpose of rendering service to such a limited group [of 
speakers of foreign languages]...the emphasis placed by this 
applicant upon making available his facilities to restricted 
groups of the public does not indicate that the service of 
the proposed station would be in the public interest."  
Voice of Detroit, Inc., 6 FCC 363, 372-73 (1938).  See also 
Chicago Broadcasting Ass'n, 3 FCC 277, 280 (1936), Voice of 
Brooklyn, 8 FCC 230, 248 (1940).

These pre-World War II cases involving, inter alia, Yiddish 
language programming probably reflect anti-Semitism.  The 
programming was largely intended for Jewish immigrants who 
had fled Germany and Poland.  It surely reflected a climate 
in which none but WASPs could hope for access to the 
airwaves.  In this atmosphere, it would have been 
unthinkable for Blacks or Hispanics to seek broadcast 
licenses.

Indeed, the Commission later directly imposed its Voice of 
Detroit regime on those seeking to serve Black audiences.  
In 1360 Broadcasting Company, 36 FCC2d 1478 (Rev. Bd. 1968), 
the Commission refused to waive a minor technical rule to 
allow a first nighttime radio service to 98.1% of 
Baltimore's Black community.  Review Board Member Joseph 
Nelson dissented, pointing out that the Commission "has 
granted waivers or found substantial compliance with the 
rule where coverage was less than 100%" (citing cases, all 
involving new service to Whites, where proposed coverage 
would have been 90.2%, 95% and 90.6%).  Yet the Commission 
persisted in this deliberately discriminatory licensing 
policy.  See Mel-Lin, Inc., 22 FCC2d 165 (1970), 
(Jacksonville, Florida); Champaign National Bank, 22 FCC2d 
790 (1970) (Champaign, Illinois). 
	Comments of NAACP and LULAC, 8-11, GC Docket No. 92-52, 
dated June 2, 1992.  The NAACP and LULAC have also noted that:
In United Steel Workers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), the 
Supreme Court held that exclusion of minorities from crafts 
on racial grounds was so well known it could be judicially 
noticed.  While broadcasting is a much smaller industry than 
steelmaking, the history of minority exclusion from 
broadcast employment has been so well known that it hardly 
bears repeating.  See U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 
Window Dressing on the Set (1977); Report of the National 
Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, supra, at 383-84 
(finding that in journalism in 1968, fewer than 1% of 
management employees were Black, and most of these worked in 
Black owned organizations).  Nonetheless, despite hundreds 
of EEO complaints, only once, in Catoctin Broadcasting of 
New York, 4 FCC Rcd 2553, 2558 (subsequent history omitted) 
has the FCC found that a licensee engaged in discrimination.  
The D.C. Circuit has repeatedly been critical of the FCC's 
failure to enforce its EEO Rule.  Beaumont Branch of the 
NAACP v. FCC, 854 F.2d 342 (D.C. Cir. 1986); Bilingual 
Bicultural Coalition on the Mass Media v. FCC, 556 F.2d 59 
(D.C. Cir. 1977).  Indeed, minority representation in 
broadcast employment remains...far [below] parity with the 
representation of minorities in the population.  See FCC 
Broadcast EEO Trend Reports, 1975-90.  

Comments of NAACP and LULAC, 18, N. 6, GC Docket No. 92-52, dated 
June 2, 1992.


	Additionally, in 1977 a legal study found that the 
Commission's EEO requirements were "vague, variable, evasive and 
easily met, even by broadcasters who actively discriminate," and 
that FCC regulations fell below the standards set by federal 
courts that deal with the legislation governing EEO.  N.A. Bowie 
and J.W. Whitehead, "The Federal Communications Commission's 
Equal Employment Opportunity Regulation - An Agency in Search of 
a Standard," 5 Black Law Journal 313 (1977).  Furthermore, 
statistics compiled by the National Association of Black Owned 
Broadcasters (NABOB) show that in 1980 African Americans owned 
1.57% of all radio stations.  In 1991, that percentage had grown 
to only 1.64%. In re Revision of Radio Rules and Policies, 7 FCC 
Rcd 2755, 2814, N. 12 (1992) (Statement of Commissioner Andrew C. 
Barrett dissenting in part and concurring in part).

	The above history reveals that current FCC policies actively 
reinforce a long history of past discriminatory behavior.  By 
institutionalizing the past discriminatory behavior which 
resulted in the current paucity of stations owned by minorities, 
the Commission has engaged in unconstitutional behavior.  See 
Columbia Board of Education v. Denick, 443 U.S. 449, 458-59 
(1979) (14th Amendment requires abandonment of policies which 
reinforce present effects of past discrimination).


	B.	CURRENT FCC POLICY REGARDING MINORITIES, BROADCASTING 
AND DIVERSITY IN PROGRAMMING.

	The FCC's minority policies were initially conceived with 
the claimed objective of fostering broadcast content diversity, 
rather than remedying any past discrimination suffered by 
minorities.  See, Kleiman, "Content Diversity and the FCC's 
Minority and Gender Licensing Policies," 35 J. of Broadcasting & 
Electronic Media, 411, 413 (Fall 1991).  In 1971, the court noted 
the need for diversity of ownership, asserting that diversity of 
ownership was directly related to program content.  Citizens 
Communication Center v. FCC, 447 F.2d 1201 (DC Cir. 1971).  The 
court noted that "as new interest groups and hitherto silent 
minorities emerge in our society they should be given some stake 
in and chance to broadcast on our radio and television 
frequencies."  Id. at 1213.  The Commission later released its 
Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcasting 
Facilities, 68 FCC 2d 979 (1978) which claimed to find no overt 
discrimination, but cited significant barriers to minority entry 
into broadcasting.  

	The Commission's current policy towards achieve programming 
diversification is to foster its minority ownership policies and 
Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) rules rather than through 
direct regulation of programming.  Deregulation of Radio, 84 FCC 
2d 968, 977, recon. granted in part, 87 FCC2d 797 (1981) aff'd in 
pertinent part sub nom. Office of Communication of the United 
Church of Christ v. FCC, 707 F.2d 1413 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  The 
House Conference Committee Report adopted in 1982, when Congress 
affirmed its support for the distress sale policy , stated that:
An important factor in diversifying the media of mass 
communications is promoting ownership by racial and ethnic 
minorities - groups that traditionally have been extremely 
underrepresented in the ownership of telecommunications 
facilities and media properties.  The policy of encouraging 
diversity of information sources is best served by not only 
awarding preferences based on the number of properties 
already owned, but also by assuring that minority and ethnic 
groups that have been unable to acquire any significant 
degree of media ownership are provided an increased 
opportunity to do so.
H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 765, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 40, 43 (1982).  See 
also S. Rep. 182, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 76 (1987) ("Diversity of 
ownership results in diversity of programming and improved 
service to minority and woman audiences.").  And in Metro 
Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 110 S.Ct. 2997 (1990) the Supreme 
Court, in upholding the Commissions's policy permitting distress 
sales to minority broadcasters, held that the promotion of 
minority ownership and implementation of the FCC minority 
ownership policies serves an important national interest.  In 
upholding this regulation, the Court noted that Congress had 
mandated that the FCC pursue these policies.  The Court also 
noted that the benefit of increased minority ownership redounds 
to all Americans, not just minorities.  Id.

	Thus, the Commission claims that it promotes minority 
ownership by allowing preferences for minorities in lottery 
licensing, Amendment of the Commission's Rules to Allow the 
Selection from among Certain Competing Applications Using Random 
Selection or Lotteries Instead of Comparative Hearings, 91 FCC 2d 
74 (1982) and by allowing minority-controlled stations to be 
excepted in the Commission's multiple ownership rules.  Amendment 
to Section 73.3555 of the Commission's Rules Relating to Multiple 
Ownership of AM, FM and Television Broadcast Stations, 100 FCC 2d 
74 (1985).  Yet these policies have produced little improvement, 
and some policies, such as the minority exception with regard to 
multiple ownership, are in the process of being repealed.  Thus, 
while the Commission asserts that "[e]fforts to promote minority 
ownership [citing Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of 
Broadcast Facilities, supra] and EEO are underway and promise to 
bring about a more demographically representative radio 
industry," little programming or ownership diversification has 
actually resulted from these policies.  In fact, current FCC 
regulations promoting broadcast diversity differ significantly 
from those which previously served the broadcast industry through 
an earlier era of rapid broadcast development.  Compare En Banc 
Programming Inquiry 44 FCC 2303, 2314 (1960) and Public Service 
Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees 15 (March 7, 1946) (the 
"Blue Book") (claiming each station is expected to serve minority 
groups).  

	While the Commission claims that it has sought to enhance 
programming diversity by promoting minority ownership, studies 
reflecting minority ownership in radio and TV reveal that these 
policies have been a dismal failure.  As Commissioner Barrett has 
himself noted, no distress sales have been granted to minorities 
since 1988, and only 38 have been granted since the inception of 
the policy.  In re Revision of Radio Rules and Policies, supra, 
2815 (Statement of Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett dissenting in 
part and concurring in part).  In addition, the issuance of tax 
certificates has decreased dramatically since 1990.  Id., at 
Appendix 2.

	Almost all relevant statistical indexes reveal that the 
Commission has failed to promote broadcast diversity through its 
minority ownership policies.  In 1972, African American ownership 
of stations was less than 20 of the 7,000 licensed radio 
stations, and no TV stations.  "Coming Through the Front Door of 
Ownership:  A New Direction for Blacks in Broadcasting," 
Broadcasting, 35-8, Oct. 25, 1972.  From 1976 to 1981, when the 
FCC claimed to be seriously committed to increasing minority 
ownership, the number of African American owned radio stations 
grew from 30 to 141.  However, from 1981 to 1991 when the 
Commission pursued its policy of deregulation, the number of 
radio stations owned by African Americans rose from a figure of 
141 to only 182.  In re: Revision of Radio Rules and Policies, 
supra, 2769[?], N. 63.  When looked at as a percentage of all 
radio station ownership, these figures reveal that only 2% of all 
FM stations are owned by African Americans.  
From 1990 to 1991...the percentage of minority owned 
broadcast stations has actually declined from its already 
inconsequential level.  The decline was particularly serious 
with respect to radio broadcasting.  The gross number of 
minority owned stations declined from 173 to 165 for AM, and 
from 99 to 91 for FM.  Expressed as a percentages of all 
stations, minority ownership declined from 3.5% to 3.3% for 
AM, and from 2.3% to 2.0% for FM.  The figures for Hispanic 
ownership are equally discouraging, dropping from 1.3% to 
1.2% for AM, and from .6% to .5% for FM.  A Statistical

Petition for Reconsideration of the League of United Latin 
American Cities (LULAC), 20, MM Docket No. 91-140, May 29, 1992.  
In fact, while the broadcasting industry increased in size, the 
number of minority owned commercial broadcast stations declined 
in 1991 from 301 to 287, a drop of 4.7%  See Report on Minority 
Broadcasting Trends, NTIA (November 1991).  

	Minority owned stations are predominantly among the smaller 
stations in their markets, in terms of ratings and profits.  As a 
result, the numbers of minority owned stations will likely 
decrease significantly once the Commission implements its current 
Report and Order raising ownership limits to 60.  See infra at 
...  The outlook for minority broadcasters appears particularly 
bleak in light of previous Commission practices reaffirming 
discriminatory patterns in the broadcasting industry, and in 
light of the Commission's current approach towards broadcast 
deregulation.  Given all of the above, it is not surprising that 
the  Commission's half-hearted attempts at promoting minority 
diversification in broadcasting over the last several years have 
failed. 


	C.	IMPACT OF RECENT FCC POLICY ON MINORITY BROADCASTERS
		1.	DEREGULATION OF BROADCASTING
	In 1981, the Commission began the process of broadcast 
deregulation.  Deregulation of Radio, supra, at ___.  Broadcast 
deregulation continued throughout the 1980s, and the policy goals 
of deregulation inform the Commission's current policies.  Mbanna 
Kantako began his unlicensed micro radio broadcasts over WTRA 
(subsequently, Black Liberation Radio) during this period of 
rapid broadcast deregulation.  Kantako's actions were 
significant, in that broadcast deregulation increased the need 
for programming diversity in communities such as Springfield, 
where minority needs are otherwise unmet by the mainstream media.
		
		Deregulation of the broadcast industry has 
resulted in a stark reversal of previous Commission policy.  
Because deregulation has decreased minority representation in the 
broadcast industry, it has had a discriminatory impact on 
minority groups.  As the above statistics indicate, the impact of 
deregulation has seriously damaged the interests of minority 
broadcasters and their audience.  In spite of FCC assurances, 
programming diversity has suffered.  This reversal has occurred 
for many reasons.  By assuming the marketplace would respond to 
needs of the community of listeners, the Commission ignored 
commentators who argued that advertisers do not value all 
listeners equally.  Deregulation of Radio, supra, at 1033.  These 
commentators noted that broadcasters program for audiences likely 
to purchase advertised goods, and that these demographic groups 
seldom represent the wants and needs of racial and ethnic 
minorities and the elderly.  Id.  These commentators also noted 
that licensees responding to marketplace forces would not respond 
to low income listeners because advertisers consider them 
commercially insignificant.  Id.  The Commission's response to 
these arguments was merely to cite studies showing that low 
income families and African Americans are more name-brand 
conscious in their buying habits.  Id. at 1033-35.  The 
Commission asserted these findings showed that Black formatted 
stations would have an incentive to broadcast to this minority 
community.  Id.  Because the Commission eliminated long-form 
license renewal requirements which could provide important 
information as to the short- and long-term effects of 
deregulation, no data has ever been provided to support the 
Commission's above assertion.

	Under earlier Commission regulations, each station was 
"expected" to serve minority groups.  Public Service 
Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees, supra.  The above history 
of FCC actions reflects that this was not always the case.  Yet 
under radio deregulation, the Commission has further eroded the 
power of the broadcast media to serve minority interests.  In 
their Report and Order, the Commission ruled that if only one 
station in a market is "serving" minorities, no other station in 
the market need be required to do so.  Deregulation of Radio, 
supra, at 991.  In addition, the implementation of radio 
deregulation eliminated important broadcast rules which 
previously insured that media outlets addressed the needs of 
minority communities.  These rule changes are briefly examined in 
the sections below.

				a.	ELIMINATION OF 
REQUIREMENTS REGARDING FORMAL ASCERTAINMENT 
OF COMMUNITY NEEDS
	In their order implementing broadcast deregulation, the 
Commission repealed regulations requiring the formal 
ascertainment of community problems and needs, along with the 
expectation that radio stations would contact minority groups 
within the community.  See, First Report and Order, 84 F.C.C. 2d 
968, 49 R.R. 2d 1 (1981); Second Report and Order, 96 F.C.C. 2d 
930, 55 R.R. 2d 1401 (1984).  The Commission attempted to justify 
this decision by focusing on the growing number of radio stations 
in the United States.  The Commission argued "[i]t is not 
necessary that each station attempt to provide service to all 
segments of the community."  First Report and Order, 84 FCC 2d 
968, 997 (1981).  Using a cost/benefit analysis, the Commission 
ruled that these logs would not necessarily provide any 
information relative to the specific content of programming, 
Report and Order, Deregulation of Radio, 84 FCC 2d 1008-09, and 
stated that more relevant information could be provided through 
compiling simple "issues/programs" lists that would provide 
illustrative information on 5 to 10 issues covered by the station 
during any broadcast year. United Church of Christ [III], 707 
F.2d at 1439.  

	However, this cost/benefit analysis has been criticized as 
focusing more heavily on industry costs than regulatory benefits.  
See, Hagelin and Wimmer, Broadcast Deregulation and the 
Administrative Responsibility to Monitor Policy Change: An 
Empirical Study of the Elimination of Logging Requirements, 38 
(No. 2) Federal Communications Law Journal 201 (date?)....

			b.  ELIMINATION OF LONG-FORM LICENSE RENEWAL
	The elimination of logging requirements must also be seen in 
light of the Commission's other deregulatory actions.  One such 
action, the elimination of long-form license renewal, further 
reduced the amount of information available to the public and the 
Commission as to whether broadcasters adequately serve minority 
communities.  Both the elimination of community ascertainment 
requirements and long form licensing renewal show that the 
Commission does not want to be bothered with information which 
may help ascertain the actual impact of deregulation on minority 
broadcasters and the listening and viewing public.

			c.	ELIMINATION OF THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE

	In addition to past discriminatory policies, the 
Commission's efforts at deregulating the broadcast industry have 
set into play broad forces which contradict the important policy 
goals of broadcast diversity mandated by Congress and the Supreme 
Court.  See, Metro Broadcasting, supra, at ___.  The Commission's 
decision to eliminate the fairness doctrine was one action which 
significantly reduced the diversity of programming content within 
the electronic media.  The fairness doctrine required stations to 
broadcast information about controversial issues of public 
importance and to cover significant views concerning those 
issues.  The Commission sought to eliminate the fairness doctrine 
during the earliest stages of deregulation, but Congressional 
pressure kept this doctrine in place for several more years.  
Nevertheless, citing the increased number of existing broadcast 
stations, the Commission argued that "the growth in both radio 
and television broadcasting provides reasonable assurance that a 
sufficient diversity of opinion in controversial issues of public 
importance will be provided in each broadcast market."  Fairness 
Doctrine, 102 FCC 2d 143, 208 (1985), subsequent history omitted.  
[Find statistics, arguments, etc. re: impact of repeal of 
fairness doctrine on broadcasting diversity].

	In light of the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine, micro 
radio is essential if the airwaves are to provide much needed 
media diversity at the local level.  The Commission itself has 
acknowledged that diversity of perspectives is most important at 
the local level.  In re Revision of Radio Rules and Policies, 
supra, paragraph 20.  Because repeal of the Fairness Doctrine has 
further narrowed the number of viewpoints available over the 
broadcast media, micro radio remains one of the few vehicles by 
which voices outside the narrow mainstream of media "consensus" 
can make themselves heard.  

		2.	INCREASE IN CORPORATE OWNERSHIP LIMITS OF AM AND 
FM COMMERCIAL RADIO
	Most recently, the Commission has sought to further 
deregulate the broadcast industry, with potentially disastrous 
consequences for minority broadcasters and the listening 
audience.  In their Report and Order entitled In re Revision of 
Radio Rules and Policies, 7 FCC Rcd 2755 (1992), the Commission 
seeks to increase the number of radio stations one corporate 
entity can own.  

	However, such an increase would lead to further 
concentration of ownership in the broadcast industry, 
significantly reducing opportunities for increased minority 
ownership of broadcast facilities.  When the Commission 
previously increased ownership limits in the early 1980s, 
numerous mergers resulted:  NBC was purchased by General 
Electric, Capital Cities bought ABC and several other owners 
merged into larger groups.  Because the change in rules drove up 
station prices as competition for these stations became more 
intense, minority station owners were further precluded from 
bidding for these radio outlets.  As major AM and FM radio 
stations consolidate their resources to dominate local markets, 
minority broadcasters are prevented from effectively competing 
for audiences, and are driven from the market.

	The League of United Latin American Citizens has recently 
noted the effects this rule will have on concentration of 
ownership.  LULAC observed that: 
In 1984, 4,733 AM stations and 4,649 FM stations were on the 
air.  Broadcasting and Cable Marketplace, 1992, p. E-15.  In 
1991, these numbers were 4,984 and 5,810, respectively.  Id.  
Thus, the number of all radio stations grew between 1984 and 
the present from 9,382 to 10,794, an increase of precisely 
15%.  The Commission's action [raising ownership limits] 
will increase concentration from a total of 24 stations a 
single owner can hold to a total of 60.  That represents a 
concentration increase of precisely 150%.  The increase in 
concentration, in sum, will be fully 1,000% of, or ten times 
as great as, the growth in the number of radio stations in 
the same time period.
Petition for Reconsideration of the League of United Latin 
American Cities (LULAC), 11, MM Docket No. 91-140, May 29, 1992.  
Additionally, while the gross number of radio stations has 
increased since 1950, the increased ownership limits currently 
promulgated by the Commission will permit concentration of radio 
ownership to return to a level equal to or exceeding that which 
existed in 1950.   LULAC has argued:
There is no sound justification for returning to the level 
of diversity that existed in 1950.  Since that year, the 
number of radio households in the United States has more 
than doubled, increasing from 42.1 million to 94.4 million 
in 1991.  Broadcast & Cable Marketplace, 1992, p. E-16.  At 
the same time, the complexity of our dynamic society has 
grown enormously.  These changes rationally require an 
increase in the number of perspectives.  And that increased 
diversity must be achieved through broadcasting.  
Broadcasting is in fact even more important today as a 
medium of mass communication than it was in 1950.  Although 
a few cable news services have appeared since then, that 
increase in news media is more than offset by the vast 
decline in the number of daily newspapers since 1950.

Petition for Reconsideration of the League of United Latin 
American Cities (LULAC), 16-17, MM Docket No. 91-140, May 29, 
1992.  LULAC has observe with respect to the above that:
The Commission has, in effect, mortgaged the same asset 
twice.  On the one hand, growth in stations since 1950 
justifies abolishing requirements that promote diversity of 
perspectives by single stations.  On the other hand, the 
same growth justifies increasing concentration of ownership, 
and concomitant reduction of diversity, to the 1950 level.  
The final result is that the public is actually worse off 
than it was in 1950.  Now it will have the 1950 level of 
ownership diversity.  But it will not have the diversity it 
had in 1950 that was promoted by the radio's former public 
interest obligations.

	Id. at 19. 



		3.	ELIMINATION OF THE MINORITY OWNERSHIP INCENTIVE 
RULE.
	The Commission in its recent Report and Order also seeks to 
eliminate the minority incentive rule for radio station 
ownership.  Report and Order, supra, at ___.  In his dissent, 
Commissioner Barrett argues that this Order dismisses the 
minority ownership incentive without sufficient consideration for 
the current state of minority ownership, the Commission's own 
precedents, and Congressional concerns.  This action appears to 
contravene the Commission's previous claimed policy, and may in 
fact violate the law.  See Multiple Ownership Rules, 100 FCC2d 
75, 94 (1985).  see also Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 110 
S.Ct. 2997, 3010-11 (1990); TV 9, Inc. v. FCC, 495 F.2d 929, 938 
(D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 986 (1974).  The 
elimination of this incentive rule also goes against the mandate 
of Congress.  See Pub. L. 102-140, 105 Stat. 782, October 28, 
1991 [FCC Appropriation Legislation].  

	Commissioner Barrett argues that the Commission's decision 
to eliminate the minority ownership incentive is "contrary to the 
FCC's public interest goals."  In Re Revision of Radio Rules and 
Policies, supra, at 2813 (Statement of Commissioner Andrew C. 
Barrett dissenting in part and concurring in part).  However, 
viewed in light of the Commission's policies over the last 11 
years, it appears that this decision is consistent with the 
Commission's undeclared war on poor and minority broadcasters.


		4.	ELIMINATION OF DUOPOLY RULE

	The most serious potential injury to minority broadcasters 
is the repeal of the duopoly rule,  such that a single 
corporation may own as many as 3 AM stations and 3 FM stations in 
the largest radio markets.  See In re Revision of Radio Rules and 
Policies, supra, 2816-18 (Barrett, dissenting in part).  Again, 
this proposal encourages the increased consolidation of radio 
ownership, further squeezing those broadcasters owning the 
smallest stations.  Because FCC policies prevented minority 
broadcasters from entering the radio industry at its earliest 
stages, most minority broadcasters today entered the business at 
a later date and consequently own many of these smaller stations.  
As a result, it is the minority broadcasters and their audience 
who are most negatively affected by the Commission's 
encouragement of further radio consolidation .  "Clearly 
diversity will suffer within radio markets as large station 
groups grow and wipe out smaller players."  In re Revision of 
Radio Rules and Policies, supra, 2818 (Statement of Commissioner 
Andrew C. Barrett dissenting in part).  FCC policies promoting 
common ownership will ultimately squeeze minority stations and 
decrease programming diversity.  Because minorities have been 
frozen out by the Commission's policies, removing the prohibition 
on micro radio broadcasts is one small but necessary step in 
rectifying this historic imbalance.

	D.	CONCLUSION

	Others have previously argued that the Commission's 
interpretation of diversity in broadcasting does not constitute 
"cultural pluralism" but rather "business pluralism"; that is, 
the Commission believes that diversity of business enterprises 
with broadcast licenses constitutes an adequate expression of 
communications diversity.  See, R. Bunce, Television in the 
Corporate Interest, 13-39 (1976).  However, this concept of 
business pluralism is seriously flawed.  True broadcast diversity 
cannot occur when social, cultural and political viewpoints 
diverging from the status quo of mainstream commercial 
broadcasting are excluded from the public airwaves.  Because of 
the profit-oriented nature of commercial broadcasting and the 
corporate funded context within which most public broadcasting 
occurs, true broadcast diversity is unavailable under current FCC 
policies.


	Now more than ever, true diversity of opinion and expression 
is required over the public airwaves.  The growing economic 
disparity between the White majority and the underclass of 
minority citizens in this country has added to the deteriorating 
social health of the country.  One means of addressing this 
disparity is through the media, particularly the electronic 
broadcast media.  However, today minorities are nowhere to be 
found in these media.  Broadcast media are vital in reaching 
minorities, yet minority ownership of broadcast stations remains 
at 2.7%.  See A Statistical Analysis of Minority-Owned Commercial 
Broadcast Stations Licensed int he United States, U.S. National 
Telecommunications & Information Administration, October, 1991.  
Nevertheless, the Commission maintains that a strong relationship 
exists between diversity of station ownership and the diversity 
of perspectives available on the air.  See, e.g., Multiple 
Ownership, 63 FCC 2d 824, 829 (1977).  Although there may be some 
truth to this (cite Fife article), the Commission's policies have 
nevertheless failed in establishing either diversity of ownership 
or diversity of perspectives.  Given the state of race relations 
in the United States today, this is especially unfortunate.  As 
the Kerner Report (1968) recognized, the mass media has failed to 
enhance interracial communications.  This report noted that 
racism in the media was in part responsible for civil unrest in 
the 1960s.
The media report and write from the standpoint of a white 
man's world.  The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of 
life there, the Negro's burning sense of grievance, are 
seldom conveyed.  Slights and indignities are part of the 
Negro's daily life, and many of them come from what he calls 
the "white press" - a press that repeatedly if unconsciously 
reflects the biases, paternalism, the indifference of White 
America.  This may be understandable, but it is not 
excusable in an institution that has the mission to inform 
the whole of our society.
Kerner Report at 203.  Today the situation is no better.  Large 
segments of the American population have been left unrepresented 
by the media, as confirmed in the aftermath of the Los Angeles 
riots.  Increasingly, issues regarding literacy and the ability 
to structurally analyze a variety of injustices must be 
addressed.  Such an analysis requires a diverse flow of 
information from all segments of the media - not just those media 
owned by corporate America.  In our current age of extreme media 
imbalance, where there is little hope this imbalance will be 
addressed soon, an important method of achieving some form of 
communications diversity is through the operation of micro radio 
broadcasts in those communities where an extreme informational 
imbalance exists.
	In their recent Report and Order (In re Revision of Radio 
Rules and Policies, supra) the Commission noted that diversity of 
perspectives is most important at the local level.  The 
Commission reiterated that "for an individual member of the 
audience, the richness of ideas to which he is exposed turns on 
how many diverse views are within his local market."  Report and 
Order, paragraph 20.  Further, the Commission has previously held 
that
[a] proper objective is the maximum diversity of ownership 
that technology permits in each area.  We are of the view 
that 60 different licensees are more desirable than 50, and 
even that 51 are more desirable than 50.  In a rapidly 
changing social climate, communication of ideas is vital.  
If a city has 60 frequencies available but they are licensed 
to only 50 different licensees, the number of sources for 
ideas is not maximized.  It might be that the 51st 
licensee...would become the communication channel for a 
solution to a severe social crisis.  No one can say that the 
present licensees are broadcasting everything worthwhile 
that can be communicated.
Multiple Ownership of Broadcast Stations, 22 FCC2d 306, 311 
(1970).  Nevertheless, despite the lip service that the 
Commission currently pays to ownership and broadcast "diversity," 
it is clear that the Commission has failed in promulgating 
regulations which promote free and vigorous debate over the 
airwaves.  Those who are now excluded are those who have always 
been excluded in America - this country's racial and ethnic 
minorities along with the poor.  Empirical evidence demonstrates 
that a market failure in minority-oriented programming has 
occurred.  See: Wimmer, The Future of Minority Advocacy Before 
the FCC:  Using Marketplace Rhetoric to Urge Policy Change, 41 
Fed. Com. LJ, 133 (1989) [Citing numerous studies detailing how 
minority interests have ill-served in the wake of broadcast 
deregulation].  Significantly, FCC prohibition of micro radio 
broadcasts occurs within the context of the Commission's 
continued elimination of safeguards designed to protect minority 
broadcasters.  

	As Commissioner Barrett recently observed, every time the 
Commission relaxes its ownership rules it points to a "safeguard" 
which it later abandons.  In re Revision of Radio Rules and 
Policies, supra, 2818-19, N. 21 (Statement of Commissioner Andrew 
C. Barrett dissenting in part and concurring in part).  Each time 
the Commission weakened national ownership rules, regional 
concentration rules, duopoly rules and one-to market rules, the 
Commission pointed to the existence of another as a safeguard.  
Id.  However, it now appears that all of these rules are 
essentially gone and there are no more safeguards.  Id.  And yet, 
although the Supreme Court in FCC v. WNCN Listeners Guild, 450 
U.S. 582 (1981) approved the Commission's decision to allow 
market forces to promote diversity in entertainment formats, the 
Court warned "the Commission should be alert to the consequences 
of its policies and should stand ready to alter its rule if 
necessary to serve the public interest more fully."  Id. at 603.  
The Court reiterated its language from NBC v. United States that 
"If time and changing circumstances reveal that the "public 
interest" is not served by application of the Regulations, it 
must be assumed that the Commission will act in accordance with 
its statutory obligations."  Id. at 225.  

	Although empirical research has found that economic 
competition works in a manner inconsistent with racial equality 
(Wimmer and Wright, 1985 - LOCATE) the Commission nevertheless 
argues that broadcast deregulation is in the best interests of 
minority broadcasters and minority audiences.   However, after 
many years of pursuing its policy of minority ownership, the 
number of minority owned broadcast outlets remains outrageously 
disproportionate to this country's minority population.  While 
African-Americans comprise approximately 12% of the U.S. 
population, as of 1990 they owned only about 1.5% of the nation's 
1,100 television stations and 1.7% of the 10,600 radio stations.  
Viewpoint: Fix Broadcasting's Imbalance, Electronic Media, 14, 
Jul. 16 1990, col. (?).  The Commission has done away with 
requirements such as logging and long-form license renewal which 
would otherwise reveal whether or not deregulation has failed.  
Furthermore, the FCC acknowledges it has conducted no studies of 
the mass media marketplace at all.  See: Request for Information 
Concerning Broadcast Deregulation 11-15, attached to Letter from 
Alex D. Felker, Chief, Mass Media Bureau, FCC, to the Hon. 
William H. Gray III, Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. 
House of Representatives (May 24, 1988).  In fact, the Commission 
has made no good faith inquiry into the negative effects of 
deregulation, particularly with regard to minority interests.  As 
it now stands, minority broadcasters do not have the capital 
necessary to compete in the high-priced world of electronic 
telecommunications.  

	Ultimately, minority broadcasting in the United States is 
intrinsically tied to previous trends in mass communications 
history.  This history reveals that
	
[t]he early development of heavily capitalized monopolistic 
and oligopolisitic control in twentieth-century mass 
communication eliminated undercapitalized minorities who 
tried to develop ownership of dominant mass media 
institutions.  Any exceptions to this pattern...occur 
because "White corporations allow these Black companies to 
exist for symbolic value alone," as part of the mythology 
that black Americans can also have power in the Capitalist 
system.
Fife, Racial Diversity in U.S. Broadcasting, 9 Media, Culture and 
Society 496 (citing Fife, "FCC Policy on Minority Ownership in 
Broadcasting: A Political Systems Analysis of Regulatory 
Policymaking", Doctoral dissertation, Stanford University (1984) 
AND M. Marable, How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America, 158 
(1983)).  Those FCC policies that have been formulated in 
response to black media activists
do not challenge the essential business pluralism that 
characterizes the US broadcasting industry and represent 
symbolic acknowledgements by the FCC and the broadcasting 
industry of black concerns about racial and cultural 
diversity.  At the same time, these policies are consistent 
with mainstream majority cultural understanding about race 
and minority status in US society.  This understanding is 
fundamentally one of a monocultural society that sees Afro-
American values and expressions as strictly subcultural, and 
not appropriate for dissemination though dominant mass 
communications institutions.
Id. (?)  These policies have subsequently led to decreased 
diversity of programming in our print and electronic media which 
fail to reach out towards the melting pot (or perhaps more 
accurately, boiling pot) which comprises contemporary American 
society.  As Commissioner Barrett has stated, Americans do not 
live in a color blind society, and it is presumptuous to think 
that the unregulated marketplace will operate as if society were 
color blind.  Barrett Cites Minority Gains in Ownesrhip, 
Broadcasting, 53, Apr. 30, 1990, col. (?).

	Given the above, micro radio appears perfectly suited to 
addressing this imbalance by promoting broadcast diversity.  
Kantako's station is itself "part of a larger history of using 
low-powered media to reach ethnic audiences."  See, Shields & 
Ogles, "Black Liberation Radio: A case study of the micro-radio 
movement," supra, at 14.  Micro radio may thus be viewed as a 
supplemental media tool operating at the local level.  Appendix 1 
to the Commissions own Report and Recommendations in the Low 
Power Television Inquiry states:
We may consider [very low power transmitters] as solutions 
to two problems.  They serve to "extend" service to areas 
that presently have no service at all.  They also serve to 
"expand" service by increasing the variety of services 
available in a community.
Id., supra, at 24.  Commissioner Andrew Barrett has stated that 
minority entrepreneurs should look to alternative media, rather 
than limited available opportunities in traditional broadcast in 
cable.  Communications Daily, 6, Apr. 25, 1990, col. (?).  
Barrett has noted that the increased trend towards concentration 
(of ownership) in traditional media means there are fewer 
opportunities for newcomers, and that concentration has put 
increased pressure on the FCC's minority ownership policies.  Id.  

	Current regulations prohibiting the operation and 
utilization of micro radio should be eliminated in light of the 
Commission's mandate to serve the public interest (including the 
mandate to promote broadcast diversity), in light of the history 
of institutionalized racism perpetuated by the Commission, and in 
light of the Commission's recent acknowledgement that competition 
and diversity are relevant at the local level, In re Revision of 
Radio Rules and Polices, supra, at 11.  Such prohibitions, where 
a need for these broadcasts undoubtedly exists, 
unconstitutionally interfere with the rights of minority 
broadcasters and their community to access their fundamental 
First Amendment rights.


VIII.	INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND IN PARTICULAR, THE U.N. 
DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, PROHIBIT THE 
COMMISSION'S INTERFERENCE WITH MBANNA KANTAKO'S MICRO 
RADIO BROADCASTS, WHICH VIOLATES THE RIGHT TO 
COMMUNICATE OF KANTAKO AND HIS COMMUNITY.

	Given the facts surrounding the operation of Black 
Liberation Radio, prohibiting Kantako's one watt radio station 
appears to violate his right to freedom of expression under 
international law.  The Declaration of Human Rights and 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights establish 
the principle under International law that every person is 
entitled to participate in and develop the cultural life of his 
or her community.  

	The long standing rule of construction first enunciated by 
Chief Justice Marshall is that "an act of congress ought never to 
be construed to violate the law of nations, if any other possible 
construction remains...."  The Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 
34, 67 (1804), quoted in Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U.S. 571, 578.  
Thus, in The Nereide, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 388, 422 (1815) Chief 
Justice Marshall found that in the absence of congressional 
enactment, United States courts are "bound by the law of nations, 
which is part of the law of the land."  Id.  Similarly, in The 
Paquete Habana, 175 U.S. 677 (1900) the Court stated that 
"[i]nternational law is part of our law, and must be ascertained 
and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate 
jurisdiction, as often as questions of right depending upon it 
are duly presented for their determination."  Id. at 299.  

	International law with regard to this right is set forth as 
follows:
A.	THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS:  
ARTICLE 19
	The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was 
ratified by the United States Senate on April 2, 1992.  This 
document was deposited at the United Nations by President Bush on 
June 8, 1992, and becomes effective on September 8, 1992.  As of 
that date, this Human Rights document will have the force of law 
in the United States.  Article 19 of the Covenant was based on 
Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   
Article 19 states that 

     1.	Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without 
interference.

     2.	Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; 
this shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of 
frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through other media of his choice.

     3.	The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 
of this article carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities.  It may therefore be subject to 
certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as 
are provided by law and are necessary:
 
    a.	For respect of the rights or reputations of 
others;

    b.	For the protection of national security or of 
public order, or of public health and morals.
     
	In the relatively few opinions that it has rendered on 
Article 19 interpretation, the Human Rights Committee has 
somewhat inconsistently applied its provisions.   In one case 
involving the arrest of an individual for his political 
activities, the Committee determined that the,

"bare information from the State party that he was charged 
with subversive association and an attempt to undermine the 
morale of the armed forces is not in itself sufficient, 
without details of the alleged charges and copies of the 
court proceedings....[to support a defense] that the arrest, 
detention and trial of Grille Motta was justified on any of 
the grounds mentioned in Article 19(3) of the Covenant."
U.N. Human Rights Committee, Communication No. 11/1977, paragraph 
17.

	This appears to indicate that Article 19 requires the 
government to establish, and substantiate if necessary, its 
justification for restricting the right to freedom of expression.

	However, in another opinion, the deference afforded a 
national government's restriction is self-evident.  In that case, 
the Committee decided that the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation 
was well within its rights to disallow the broadcasting of a 
television program concerning homosexuality.   The Committee 
stated that " a certain margin of discretion must be accorded to 
the responsible national authorities."   The restriction was 
permitted based on the rationale that, "[a]s far as radio and TV 
programs are concerned, the audience cannot be controlled. In 
particular, harmful effects on minors cannot be excluded."   

	These cases indicate that the scope of the "margin of 
discretion" accorded states under Article 19 is still uncertain.  
Therefore, analogy to the jurisprudence of other tribunals is 
required to determine if Kantako's right to freedom of expression 
has been violated. 

	Significantly, Article 27 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights also adds the following:
In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic 
minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall 
not be denied the right, in community with the other members 
of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and 
practice their own religion, or to use their own language.

B.  AMERICAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS:  ARTICLE 13

	Besides Article 19 from the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, Article 13 of the American Convention on 
Human Rights states  that,
    1.	Everyone has the right to freedom of thought and 
expression.  This right includes freedom to seek, 
receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds 
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing, in 
print, in the form of art, or through any other medium 
of one's choice.
    2.	The exercise of the right provided for in the foregoing 
paragraph shall not be subject to prior censorship but 
shall be subject to subsequent imposition of liability, 
which shall be expressly established by law and be 
necessary in order to ensure:
      	    a.	respect for the rights or reputations of 
others; or

    b.	the protection of national security, public order, 
or public health or morals.

    3.	The right of expression may not be restricted by 
indirect methods or means, such as the abuse of 
government or private controls over newsprint, radio 
broadcasting frequencies, or implements or equipment 
used in the dissemination of information, or by any 
other means tending to impede the communication and 
circulation of ideas and opinions.

    4.	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 above, 
public entertainments may be subject by law to prior 
censorship, for the sole purpose of regulating access 
to them for the moral protection of childhood and 
adolescence.

    5.	Any propaganda for war and any advocacy of national, 
racial, or religious hatred that constitute incitements 
to lawless violence or any other similar illegal action 
against any person or group of persons on any grounds 
including those of race, colour, religion, language, or 
national origin shall be considered as offenses 
punishable by law.

	Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights, 
entered into force July 18, 1978, has been interpreted by the 
Inter-American Court as follows:
A comparison of Article 13 with the relevant provisions of 
the European Convention (Article 10) and the Covenant 
(Article 19) indicates clearly that the guarantees contained 
in the American Convention regarding freedom of expression 
were designed to be more generous and to reduce to a bare 
minimum restrictions impeding the free circulation of ideas.
See Advisory Opinion of 13 November 1985 on Compulsory Membership 
Of Journalists' Association, 8 EHRR 165, paragraph 50.  Another 
difference between the European and American Conventions is the 
list of valid exceptions which allow a government to interfere 
with the right to freedom of expression.  The Inter-American 
convention lists only two:  "those that are necessary to ensure: 
a. respect for the rights and reputation of others; or b. the 
protection of national security, public order, or public health 
and morals." 

	Nevertheless, interpretation of the two Articles is 
relatively similar.  Like the European Court's interpretation of 
the right to freedom of expression, the Inter-American Court has 
stated

The just demands of democracy must consequently guide 
the interpretation of the Convention and, in 
particular, the interpretation of those provisions  
that bear a critical relationship to the preservation 
and functioning of democratic institutions.
Advisory Opinion of 13 November 1985 on Compulsory Membership of 
Journalists' Association, 8 EHRR 165, paragraph 44.

	Although there are no cases directly on point, Article 13 
can best be understood in the Court's application of its 
provisions as they relate to the factual setting presented in its 
Advisory Opinion on Compulsory Membership of Journalists' 
Association.  Advisory Opinion of 13 November 1985, 8 EHRR 165.  
In that case, a foreign journalist was prohibited and indeed 
fined under a local criminal statute in Costa Rica for his 
professional activities.  The government regulation required that 
journalists become members of a professional organization in 
order to perform certain activities associated with the media.  
Certain criteria were required to become a member of the 
organization including graduation form a state university with a 
particular type of degree.  The Court found this to be a 
violation of Article 13 because it "denie[d] any person access to 
the full use of the news media as a means of expressing opinions 
or imparting information."  Id.

	The Court made this final determination after several 
findings regarding the interpretation of Article 13. Among these 
is the conclusion that freedom of expression "includes and cannot 
be separated from the right to use whatever medium is deemed 
appropriate to impart ideas and to have them reach as wide an 
audience as possible."  Id., paragraph 31.
     
	Furthermore, the Inter-American Court requires that any 
governmental "restrictions imposed under Article 13(2) on freedom 
of expression depend upon a showing that the restrictions are 
required by a compelling state interest" and that if there exist 
"various options to achieve this objective, that which least 
restricts the right protected must be selected."  Id., paragraph 
46 (emphasis added); Note that the Inter-American Court likened 
certain language in the Sunday Times case of the European Court 
to this same principle.	

	In the case involving compulsory membership of journalists, 
the Court determined that the ends which the government sought to 
achieve through its regulation, namely the encouragement of 
professional ethics and responsibility, and the maintenance of 
journalists independence in relation to their employer, simply 
did not fall within those authorized by the Convention. 

	In determining whether there has been an interference with 
the right to freedom of expression, the Court has concluded that 
the broad scope of the language of the Convention does not 
necessitate that there be actual governmental intervention.  An 
example of this principle was given by the Court: 

This might be the case...when due to the existence of 
monopolies or oligopolies in the ownership of 
communications media, there are established in practice 
means tending to impede the communication and   
circulation of ideas and opinions.
Id., paragraph 56.

	In Kantako's case, the cost of complying with FCC 
regulations insures that the radio communications media is really 
not available to all citizens who wish to express their ideas, 
but only to those who can afford it.  The justification for these 
regulations is outdated and unnecessary, and not the "least 
restrictive means" to reach the government's objective.  Further, 
the regulations directly impede the dissemination of information 
and expression of ideas of an entire class of society--the poor.  
This issue must also be examined through the eyes of exposing 
racism, as the net effect of such wealth-based classification is 
to limit drastically the number of media outlets owned by non-
whites.  Such a wealth and race-based impact demonstrates that 
the U.S. government's implementation of the FCC regulations, 
lacking as they do the necessary rationale and narrowly tailored 
means, constitutes a violation of the right to freedom of 
expression as interpreted by the Inter-American Court.  

C.  EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS:  ARTICLE 10
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights  states 
that:

     1.	Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.  This 
right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to 
receive and impart information and ideas without 
interference by public authority and regardless of 
frontiers.  This article shall not prevent States from 
requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or 
cinema enterprises.

     2.	The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with 
it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such 
formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as 
are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic 
society, in the interests of national security, 
territorial integrity or public safety, for the 
prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of 
health and morals, for the protection of the reputation 
or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of 
information received in confidence, or for maintaining 
the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

	The European Court of Human Rights stated in its Handyside 
judgment that freedom of expression constitutes one of the 
essential foundations of a democratic society.  Handyside case, 
Judgment of 7 December, 1976, Series A No. 24, paragraph 49.   
Furthermore, it was noted that the application of Article 10 
should extend to information which "offend[s], shock[s], or 
disturb[s]the State or any other sector of the population."  Id.  
In essence, this case provides the basis from which all future 
cases involving freedom of expression must be interpreted.  
Freedom of expression remains at the very core of democratic 
societies.

	As is the case in U.S. Constitutional Law, political speech 
is provided with the greatest amount of protection under Article 
10 of the Convention.  The Sunday Times v. The United Kingdom, 
Judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A No. 30, paragraph 65.  This 
principle was enunciated in the case of The Sunday Times v. The 
United Kingdom in which the Court stated that it is essential for 
the mass media
              
to impart information and ideas concerning matters...of 
public interest.  Not only do the media have the task 
of imparting such information and ideas: the public 
also has the right to receive them.
Id.  The Court continued by stating that its supervision was not 
to be limited "to ascertaining whether a respondent State 
exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good 
faith."  Id., paragraph 59  The Court held that it      

is faced not with a choice between two conflicting 
principles, but with a principle of freedom of 
expression that is subject to a number of exceptions 
that must be narrowly interpreted.
Id., paragraph 65. 	

	The Sunday Times case declared that the House of Lords was 
in violation of Article 10 of the Convention when it attempted to 
restrain the newspaper from reporting a story regarding the drug, 
"thalidomide".  The Sunday Times wished to publish articles which 
detailed the history of the drug, its testing, its marketing and 
its manufacture.  The interest in the story developed because the 
drug was found to have caused severe birth defects in the 
children of mothers who had taken the drug during their 
pregnancies.  At the time of publication, litigation was pending 
against the distributors and manufacturers of the drug.  A 
violation of Article 10 was found to exist because the Court felt 
that the matter was of "public interest".

	Although The Sunday Times case involves the print media, 
certain parallels can be drawn to Black Liberation Radio.  As has 
been previously stated, Black Liberation Radio (then WTRA) was 
initially formed to fill the void which Kantako felt existed in 
local media broadcast as it related to the reporting of matters 
of "public interest" to his community.  Any regulation of his 
activities which might fall within one of the enumerated 
exceptions should be narrowly construed in light of the 
protection afforded the right to freedom of expression by 
international law, especially because the speech at issue was 
"political speech," e.g., the broadcast which motivated the 
F.C.C. action criticized police behavior.

	International case law which applies directly to radio 
broadcasting is very limited.  Therefore, it is necessary to 
analyze the principles of the other cases in light of this 
consideration.  

	In the Autronic AG case, Judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A 
No. 178, involving the retransmission of television signals from 
a Soviet satellite, the Court maintained that the application of 
Article 10 could not be confined to the content of information.  
It stated that the protection of Article 10 must necessarily 
extend to the means of transmission or reception because "any 
interference with the means necessarily interferes with the right 
to receive and impart information."  Id. at paragraph 47.
In this particular case, the Swiss government was found to be in 
violation of Article 10 in its attempt to regulate 
retransmission.  Autronic AG clearly demonstrates the notion that 
the "margin of appreciation" extended to a State's decision-
making entities must be considered on a case by case basis.  
Here, The Swiss Government's characterization of the 
retransmission as a telecommunication as opposed to a broadcast 
was deemed an ineffective and unacceptable as a means for 
prohibiting the project.  The Court stated that: 

Where, as in the instant case, there has been an 
interference with the exercise of the rights and 
freedoms guaranteed in paragraph 1 of Article 10, the 
supervision must be strict, because of the rights in 
question; the importance of these rights has been 
stressed by the Court many times.  The  necessity for 
restricting them must be convincingly established.
Id., paragraph 61.  Thus, absolute deference is not accorded to 
the Contracting States. 

	The Court did overrule the Commission's finding of an 
Article 10 violation in Radio Groppera v. Switzerland, Judgment 
of 28 March 1990, Series A No. 173.  However, the facts in Radio 
Groppera may be distinguished from those surrounding the 
operation of Black Liberation Radio.  The case of Radio Groppera 
involved the cable retransmission of radio signals from an 
unlicensed station in Italy.  The programming content consisted 
predominantly of popular music.  The Court arrived at its 
decision by balancing the interest of protecting the 
international communication order against the rights of the 
Italian broadcaster.

	Ultimately, it was decided that the Swiss government had not 
overstepped the "margin of appreciation".  The Court 
characterized the Italian applicant as a Swiss station operating 
from outside the borders.  This was done, according to the Court, 
in an effort to bypass the statutory requirements regulating 
Swiss radio stations.  In arriving at this determination, the 
Court did make an important declaration about the interpretation 
of Article 10 as a whole and the third sentence of paragraph one 
of Article 10 in particular.  The Court stated that the intended 
purpose of the third sentence was
to make it clear that States are permitted to control 
by a licensing system the way in which broadcasting is 
organized in their territories, particularly in its 
technical aspects.  It does not, however, provide that 
licensing measures shall not otherwise be subject to 
the requirements of paragraph 2, for that would lead to 
a result contrary to the object and purpose of Article 
10 taken as a whole.
Id., paragraph 62.	This statement solidifies the principle that 
the "margin of appreciation" afforded the Contracting States is 
not absolute.  It would seem that a state must have a valid 
reason for restricting the right to freedom of expression; one 
that is "necessary in a democratic society" in light of the 
conditions set forth in paragraph 2.

	This interpretation of Article 10(2) is extremely relevant 
to the operation of Black Liberation Radio.  In light of this 
interpretation, the validity of prohibiting radio stations with 
less than 100 watts must be seriously questioned.  This is 
particularly true when considering the significant technological 
advancements made in satellite and cable in recent years.  Many 
of the F.C.C. regulations were instituted due to the finite 
number of frequencies which once existed.  Here, the governments 
interest in Mbanna Kantako's activities appears more closely 
linked to the content of his broadcasts and the remarks made 
regarding police brutality than to any legitimate interest set 
forth in Article 10.

	In sum, a Contracting State must satisfy the following test 
in order to justify their interference with the right to freedom 
of expression:

          - it is "prescribed by law";
          - it is in pursuance of one of the legitimate aims
            listed in Article 10(2);
          - it is "necessary in a democratic society", having
            regard to the "duties and responsibilities".
Anthony Lester, Freedom of Expression, p 38-39 (unpublished 
article), (date unknown)	

	The first element of the test is rather self-evident while 
the second requires some interpretation.  The second paragraph of 
Article 10 sets forth a laundry list of justifications which a 
Contracting State may claim in order to validly interfere with 
the right to freedom of expression.  In the Sunday Times case, 
the court noted that these phrases (ie..in the interest of 
national security, territorial integrity etc..) should be 
interpreted in light of the entire Convention and not simply as a 
matter of domestic law.  The Sunday Times v. The United Kingdom, 
Judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A No. 30, paragraph 65.  
Therefore, the reason for the interference must be based on some 
legitimate rationale enumerated in the Article.  Id., 57.  The 
interference may not be based on some arbitrary governmental 
reasoning.

	This element of the test is important to the analysis 
regarding Black Liberation Radio.  Kantako had been operating his 
radio station for close to two years when the government shut him 
down.  If the action taken against him had genuinely been aimed 
at one of the factors listed in Article 10(2), it is more likely 
than not that government officials would have taken action much 
sooner.  It is simply too much of a coincidence that the radio 
station was shut down following Kantako's statements on the air 
concerning police brutality in his neighborhood.

	[NOTE:  One case that does seem to go against Black 
Liberation Radio is that of X v. The United Kingdom, 16 D & R 190 
(1978).  In this case, the Court stated that the valid rationale 
for an interference with the right to freedom of expression 
(listed in Article 10(2) as the "prevention of disorder and 
crime") includes those who advertise or otherwise promote pirate 
radio stations.  Id.  But here, it would be unfair to 
characterize Black Liberation Radio as a pirate radio station in 
that the government has no legitimate justification for 
curtailing his right to freedom of expression.]

	The third element of the test, the so-called "necessity" 
test has received much attention from the Court.  On several 
occasions, the Court has remarked that the word "necessary" 
should be interpreted to mean that the Contracting State must 
establish a "pressing social need" in order to account for the 
interference with the right guaranteed by Article 10.  Handyside 
case, Judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A No. 24, paragraph 48-
50; The Sunday Times v. The United Kingdom, Judgment of 26 April 
1979, Series A No. 30, paragraph 62.  As previously stated, 
another factor which must be balanced against the "necessity" is 
the public interest in the matter.  The Sunday Times v. The 
United Kingdom, Judgement of 26 April 1979, Series A No. 30, 
paragraph 65-66.

	In the present case, it is difficult for us to determine 
what, if any, is the possible pressing social need for 
prohibiting the airing of a radio program from a one watt 
station.  In fact, it is more likely that Kantako's radio station 
fulfills a pressing social need by providing a forum in which the 
concerns of his community can be adequately addressed.  There is 
a public interest in being an informed citizen so that one can 
properly participate in community activities.  
  
	As noted earlier, another factor to be considered is the 
scope of the "duties and responsibilities" associated with the 
expression.  The nature and scope of these "duties and 
responsibilities" must be derived from the context of the given 
factual scenario.  Handyside v. U.K., Judgment of 7 December 
1976, Series A No. 24, paragraph 49.   For example, in the case 
of Engel v. The Netherlands, the armed forces were involved.  
Engel v. The Netherlands, Judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A No. 
22, paragraph 100.  Therefore, the applicant had a much more 
difficult time overcoming the government's justification for the 
interference.  Here, the government's justification for 
interference is more difficult to prove.  Black Liberation Radio 
operated for close to two years without interruption, and without 
interfering with other broadcast signals.  In addition, the 
station served the needs of the community, thereby advancing the 
public interest.  Because the scope of these "duties and 
responsibilities" here differs significantly from that in Engel, 
government interference with Black Liberation Radio cannot be 
easily justified.


D.  CONCLUSION

	In general, the interpretation of the right to freedom of 
expression varies somewhat among the international tribunals and 
the Convention being interpreted.  This right has been proclaimed 
by States over and over in international instruments, supporting 
the argument that the right is part of customary international 
law.  When the claimants of this right are members of a 
demonstrably under-represented body such as African Americans, 
the avenue of investigating human rights violations based on race 
and wealth discrimination is opened.  While there are some cases 
that can be used against those seeking to exercise their rights, 
these cases may be legally distinguished from the facts 
surrounding the operation of Black Liberation Radio and others of 
its kind.  

	Again, a European state must have a valid reason for 
restricting the right to freedom of expression, one that is 
"necessary in a democratic society" in light of Article 10.  The 
Contracting State must also satisfy the following test in order 
to justify their interference with the right to freedom of 
expression.  The interference must be:  prescribed by law; in 
pursuance of the legitimate aims listed in Article 10; necessary 
in a democratic society, having regard to the duties and 
responsibilities of such a society; interpreted in light of the 
entire Convention and not simply based on domestic law.

	The strength of Kantako's claim here rests on the fact that 
he broadcast for over two years before the government attempted 
to terminate his broadcasts and that the prohibition came after 
his discussion of police brutality in his community.  As a 
result, the very real possibility exists for securing 
international resolutions condemning the United States for its 
practices and a call to amend the actions that limit the rights 
of peoples to speak and to listen.  


STANDING



I.	MICRO RADIO PRACTITIONERS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES 
UNSERVED BY THE PRESENT COMMERCIALLY BASED BROADCAST SYSTEM 
HAVE STANDING TO CHALLENGE FCC POLICIES.  

	The right of public participation in regulating the 
broadcast spectrum can be found in NBC v. United States, 319 U.S. 
190 (1943) when the Court held that "the 'public interest' to be 
served under the Communications Act is thus the interest of the 
listening public in the 'larger and more effective use of 
radio.'"  Id. at 216.  Later, the Supreme Court stated that:
[i]t is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the 
right of the broadcasters which is paramount....  It is the 
right of the public to receive suitable access to social, 
political, esthetic, moral and other ideas and experiences 
which is crucial here.  That right may not be 
constitutionally abridged either by Congress or by the FCC.
	Columbia Broadcasting System v. Democratic Nat'l Committee, 
412 U.S. 94, 102 (1973).  

	Additionally, the Court reiterated in Red Lion that it "[i]t 
is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of 
broadcasters, which is paramount."  Red Lion, supra, at 390.  The 
Court also found that "[a]s far as the First Amendment is 
concerned those who are licensed stand no better than those to 
whom licenses are refused."  Id. at 389.  The Commission itself 
has also repeatedly asserted that "[citizens] are the owners of 
the channels of television - indeed, of all broadcasting."

CONCLUSION

[Cite how micro radio allows for locally operated stations which 
provide low-cost programming that is community oriented....]

	As Lawrence Tribe has noted:
The twentieth century technological revolution has 
fundamentally altered the map of our trifurcated  
communications system.  The printing press has been replaced 
by the picture tube.  The influence of the nation's 1,730 
daily newspapers is dwarfed by that of nearly 10,000 
commercial and educational radio stations, not to mention 
the gargantuan television networks with their myriad 
affiliates.  The typical family is tuned into its TV for 
more than a third of its waking hours, and television has 
become the primary source of news for a majority of the 
population.  By 1977, broadcasting had grown to the point 
where the average American consumed four times as many words 
through the airwaves as through newsprint, and the disparity 
is increasing.
L. Tribe, (cite hornbook), 1007 (1989).  Professor Tribe 
continues that:
The trouble lies in the fact that, although these powerful 
new media have acquired the functions of the press, they 
have not yet obtained the rights of the press.  The rate of 
technological change has outstripped the ability of the law, 
lurching from one precedent to another, to address new 
realities.  Novel communications are pressed into service 
while still in their infancy, and the legal system's initial 
encounters with these newborns have a lasting influence.  As 
one astute observer has explained, "[t]echnical laymen, such 
as judges, perceive the new technology in that early, clumsy 
form, which then becomes their image of its nature, 
possibilities, and use.  This perception is an incubus on 
later understanding."

APPENDIX 1 
	Defendant in Weiner first began operating unlicensed radio 
stations at the age of 17, when he and a friend began operating 
the "Falling Star Network" out of Yonkers, New York on both the 
FM and AM bands.  In re Weiner Broadcasting Co., 6 F.C.C. 4337, 
4338 (July 9, 1991).  Before going on the air, defendant and his 
friend
visited the FCC's field office in New York City and asked if 
there was any way they could obtain a license.  They were 
told that they could not obtain a license because of the 
legal and other costs involved.  In light of the high cost 
of acquiring a broadcast station Weiner felt that the only 
way he could become a broadcaster was to broadcast 
illegally.
Id. (citations omitted).  Defendant and his friend later went on 
the air but, after a warning letter and visit from FCC  
officials, ceased broadcasting.  Id.  The two would-be 
broadcasters then
travelled to Washington, D.C., and met with then FCC 
Commissioner Nicholas Johnson to determine whether there was 
any way they could operate a small Yonkers community radio 
station without running afoul of the Commission's rules.  
They were told by Johnson that there were no frequencies 
available and that purchasing a station in New York would be 
difficult.
Id.  Defendant thereafter resumed illegal operation, beginning 
what would become two decades of sometimes pirate, sometimes 
licensed broadcasting.  Id. at 4338-43.  Addressing the 
Commission in 1971, defendant wrote:
We started the whole thing because we love Radio as an 
artistic and creative medium, and to bring freedom to the 
airwaves, not because we want fat bank accounts and 
chauffeur-driver cars.  We have chosen our operating 
frequencies especially so as not to cause interference with 
any other stations.  However, as human beings, as citizens 
of the United States, and the World, we have a right to use 
the airwaves put there by who or whatever created the 
universe, and use them we will.  This is our freedom, this 
is our right.
	Id. at 4338.  
	Finally, in 1988 the FCC took defendant to federal court in 
an effort to stop his air piracy.  United States v. Weiner, 701 
F.Supp. 14 (D.Mass. 1988), aff'd, 887 F.2d 259 (1989).  Defendant 
had purchased a seagoing ship, the "Sarah," and outfitted her 
with transmitters.  Under the name "Radio New York 
International," defendant began broadcasting music and commentary 
on the AM band from just beyond the territorial limit off the 
coast of Long Island.  Id.  The United States sought and received 
a temporary restraining order, asserting violations of both 
federal law and international radio treaties.  Id. at 14, 15.  On 
motion for a permanent injunction, the government asserted that
'numerous' AM, FM and shortwave radio stations would be 
subject to interference from future Radio New York 
International broadcasts.  [Further,] members of the 
listening public who rely on certain licensed programming 
for information and entertainment may have such programming 
disrupted.

Id. at 15.

	In response, defendant argued that he possessed

a 'constitutional right to freedom of expression over the 
public forum of the airwaves...(and)...access to unused and 
open broadcast frequencies for the purpose of disseminating 
(his) views to the public' so long as [he] met 'all 
reasonable and narrowly drawn government requirements 
related to technical and procedural matters such as 
noninterference and maximum power.'

Id. (quoting Defendant's Memorandum of Law).

	The court, ruling alternatively on each of the government's 
separate legal theories, permanently enjoined Weiner from further 
broadcasts.  Id. at 17.  First, the court noted that the 
International Telecommunication Convention, codified in the 
United States at C.F.R. § 2.100 (1987), prohibits broadcasting 
stations on ships outside of national waters, and that an 
injunction could be issued on this ground alone.  Id. at 15.  
	Turning to the Communications Act, the court noted that 
spectrum scarcity and interference are "important" reasons which 
necessitate regulation of the airwaves.  Id. at 16.  In that 
case, the court rejected defendant's argument that the broadcast 
spectrum "is a natural phenomenon, like oceans and meadows and 
mountains and lakes," thereby analogous to "streets, parks, and 
public places...subject [only] to reasonable restrictions on 
time, place and manner."  Id.  The court responded that:
Defendants ignore the fact that even if the band were 
'empty', they could not look to the First Amendment for 
authority to broadcast on an unoccupied frequency in 
violation of both federal and international law.

Id., citing FCC v. National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, 
436 U.S. 775, 798-802 (1978); Columbia Broadcasting System v. 
Democratic National Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 101 (1973)).  Here, 
the court also noted that "[T]he right of free speech does not 
include the right to broadcast without a license.  The regulation 
of the radio band in question does not infringe upon the 
constitutional rights of the defendants."  Id. at 17.

	Significantly, the court emphasized international law in 
upholding its right to prohibit Weiner's broadcasts.  In light of 
the Commission's emphasis on International law, the court should 
also focus on International law with regard to Mbanna Kantako's 
right to communicate with his community.  Specifically, the court 
must follow International law pursuant to Article 19 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 13 
of the American Convention on Human Rights, and Article 10 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights.  See: infra at ....

   Statistics indicate that the literacy rate among African American residents 
of Springfield is ___ % (citing statistics compiled in previous Springfield 
voting rights lawsuit).  Additionally, the unemployment rate among African 
Americans living within the area of Springfield encompassed by the John Hay 
Homes is currently estimated at ___%.  
   Currently, Kantako's main expenses are only for telephone interviews 
(approximately $200/month), tapes, postage, and occasionally having to replace 
a piece of equipment.
   See: Compilation by State of Minority Owned Commercial 
Broadcast Stations, The Minority Telecommunications Development 
Program, National Telecommunications & Information 
Administration, October, 1991.
   	Philosophically, Kantako's operation of Black Liberation Radio rests on 
six tenets:

1.  Blacks (and other minorities) are underrepresented in the ownership 
and operation of radio stations in the U.S. by 600%.

2.  FCC regulations and licensing requirements are blatantly 
discriminatory against minorities and low income people.

3.  It takes a minimum of $50,000 to start the smallest licensed FM 
station (100 watts).  This means that not only are most minorities 
excluded from the airwaves, but so is 90% of the entire population, 
regardless of color.

4.  The establishment media does not represent the interests and 
concerns of this excluded population.

5.  Exclusion from the media is a form of social control that is 
undemocratic and a violation of the 1st and 14th Amendments.

6.  Micro Radio is a way of beginning to empower low-income citizens; 
its the voice of the excluded.

S. Shields and R. Ogles, supra, at 9-10 (citing Townsend, "Mbanna Kantako and 
the Micro Radio Movement," 3, undated).  These philosophical tenets guide 
Mbanna Kantako's fight to enjoin the Federal Communications Commission from 
prohibiting low power micro radio broadcasts where these unlicensed broadcasts 
on serve a compelling public interest.
   Following the aftermath of the Rodney King verdict in Los Angeles, 
approximately 70 people came into the station, with another 30 calling in.
 . The station prominently features political and educational commentary on a 
variety of topics, including government policy with respect to apartheid, the 
AIDS crisis, and genocide against the African American race.  In addition to 
lectures on tape, readings, interviews with writers and "conscious" music.  
Black Liberation Radio also offers programming by and for children and 
teenagers in the community, and Kantako refuses to play music with lyrical 
content inappropriate to children.
   It is interesting to note that crime in general has dropped in the John Hay 
Homes since Black Liberation Radio began broadcasting.  Prior to going on the 
air, the neighborhood encompassed by the John Hay Homes averaged four to five 
murders a year.  However there have been few shootings since Black Liberation 
Radio went on the air.  When Black Liberation Radio started up, it was the 
neighborhood kids who first started coming around to help Kantako with the 
broadcasts and to put on their own shows.  This reflects Kantako's goal of 
reeducating the youth in the community.  To this end, books and lectures are 
read and rebroadcast along with music, cultural values and technical skills.
   Although creating space for a many high power "professional" educational 
stations was the Commission's stated goal, supporters of this proposal had 
other reasons for supporting this rule change.  As one commentator noted:

Some petitions saw the problem of low-power stations as extending beyond 
a mere failure to provide [high power] educational programming.  The 
Monte Rio Chamber of Commerce alerted the Commission to the fact that 
Class D stations "[being cheap to construct and not subject to the same 
monitoring or scrutiny that applies to commercial stations] lend 
themselves to be used as propaganda and agitation tools by radical 
groups."
	
Educational FM Radio, supra, at 432 n. 9, (citing Petition of 
Monte Rio Chamber of Commerce, Monte Rio, California, Docket 
20735, filed July 19, 1980).
   Although the Commission believed that the effect of one 10-watt station on 
the spectrum was minimal, they argued in their Second Report and Order 
that the cumulative impact of many 10 watt stations restricted 
the establishment of a network of "professional" high power 
stations providing new or extended educational radio services 
(i.e., stations typically funded by the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting).  [Cite...]   The Commission concluded that the 
public interest required moving these low-power Class D stations 
to other channels "where they would not impede the development of 
new or extended educational radio services."  Second Report and 
Order, supra, at ...   The Commission therefore imposed a freeze 
on the acceptance of additional 10-watt applications in 1978.  
First Report and Order, 68 F.C.C. 2d 988, 43 R.R. 2d 197 (1978).  
Next, the Commission sought to remove all Class D stations from 
the educational spectrum (87.9 to 91.9 megahertz, 47 C.F.R. § 
73.501(b) (1989)).  Second Report and Order, supra, at 266 
(codified at 47 C.F.R. at § 73.506 and 47 C.F.R. at § 73.512).  
Finally, starting with all renewal applications filed January 1, 
1980, all 10-watt stations were required to begin addressing how 
they would comply with the amended rules.  Second Report and 
Order, supra, at 250.

	Class D stations that chose not to leave the air had four 
alternatives under the Second Report and Order.  These stations 
could discontinue operations as a Class D station, become a 10 
watt commercial outlet, operate at the newly created Channel 200 
(87.0 MHz) or operate on a noncommercial educational FM channel.  
Second Report and Order, supra, at ___.  As a result of this 
Commission action, most Class D stations chose to acquire new 
equipment and become Class A station operating at a minimum 100 
watts rather than fend for themselves under the other options.  
These latter options were either unfeasible or offered no 
protection from signal interference caused either from new 
stations which were granted, or from the modification of existing 
ones, 47 C.F.R. § 73.209 (1989).  See: Educational FM 
Broadcasting, supra, at ___.

   This was a classic red herring:  twenty-two years earlier, the Supreme 
Court had ruled that restrictive covenants were unenforceable.  Hurd v.

did the Commission reverse itself.  Atlass Communications, Inc., 61

 In 1950, 2,234 AM stations, and a small number of FM stations, 
were on the air.  Broadcast & Cable Marketplace, 1992, p. 
E-15.  Under the Commission's original duopoly rules, 
these numbers representing something close to a minimum 
of 2,234  unduplicated voices in the nation's radio 
market.  Today, there are over 5,810 FM stations on the 
air, and a slightly smaller number of AM stations.  Id.   
Under the previous duopoly rules, these numbers 
represent something close to a minimum of 5,810 
unduplicated voices in radio markets.  The number of 
unduplicated voices has only slightly more than doubled 
since 1950.  The Commission's new duopoly rule, in 
comparison, will permit ownership concentration in any 
markets to triple.  In a greater number of markets, 
concentration can at least double.

   The Commission's "duopoly rule" refers to...
   The Commission itself has noted that "[i]ndustry revenue and profit are 
overwhelmingly concentrated in large radio stations....  [T]he top 50 revenue 
producing stations, .5 of all stations, accounted for more than 11 percent of 
total radio revenue in 1990 and an estimated 50 percent of total industry 
profit.  Report and Order, supra, paragraph 9.
  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, entered 
into force March 23, 1976.
   As with the Inter-American Court of Human rights discussed below, the 
number of decisions rendered by the Human Rights Committee pertaining to 
Article 19 is so far very limited.  Most of those opinions relate to the 
persecution of individuals for their political view points.  For now, this 
makes the interpretation of Article 19 somewhat difficult with respect to 
micro radio.  One of the best means of interpretation may be a comparison with 
Article 13 of the Inter-American Convention.  An examination of both Article 
13 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and Article 19 of the 
International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights will demonstrate the 
close alignment of provisions regarding government "necessity".  
In its Advisory Opinion on Compulsory Membership of Journalists' 
Association, 8 EHRR 165, paragraph 45 (13 Nov. 1985), the Inter-
American Court stated that Article 19 served as a model, at least 
in part, for Article 13 of the Inter-American Convention.
