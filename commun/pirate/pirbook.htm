Introduction</H1>
<P>
   Pirate broadcasting has been around for a long time, ever  since the early days of radio. Recently, it has 
gained renewed  popularity, as the opportunities in 'legal' broadcasting have declined.<P>
   Around the world, shortwave, FM, AM and even television pirate stations have been springing up. 
Reasons for building a pirate station are always a little different, from politics,  to just having fun.<P>
   It does not require great technical skill to start a pirate  station. All you need is a lot of enthusiasm, a bit 
of time, and  maybe a little money. Equipment is readily available from many  sources, and you can even 
build it yourself.<P>
   This book gives several perspectives of pirate broadcasting.  Contained within are a collection of stories, 
how-to's, and  schematics that cover almost every facet of pirate broadcasting,  both in the United States, 
and in the United Kingdom. There are  even hints for creating suitable programs for your pirate 
station.<P>
   The construction projects in this book have been tested, and  will work if you are knowledgeable and 
careful in the  construction. The projects use relatively common components that are available from many 
sources.<P>

Pirate Radio: An Informed Overview</H1>
<P>
FOREWORD<P>
<P>
   The following is by no means an in-depth introduction to electronics,  there are many such books that 
cover the subject, but intends to  explore some  of the ideas and concept involved in radio  broadcasting 
that are relevant to the pirate radio operator on  VHF FM. In particular we  will  go  a step by step tour of 
a  typical VHF FM  transmitter system  starting with the output from  the tape recorder or  mixer, and 
finishing with a brief  discussion of aerials. At each stage we will  discuss  the  pros   and  cons of  various  
alternatives  and additional  background  info, e.g. the use  of  equipment  will  be introduced.<P>
   Radio   frequency  signals  have  AMPLITUDE  and  FREQUENCY.    The frequency  is how fast the 
signal is oscillating from one   extreme to  the other and back again. Frequency is measured in  cycles  per 
second (cp/s), which these days are known as HERTZ  (Hz), 1000 Hz = 1  kHz,  1000000 Hz = 1 MHz. 
The amplitude is to  what  extent  the signal  is  oscillating. LEVEL or STRENGTH can  be  thought  of  
as meaning the same as amplitude. Amplitude can  be measured in  Volts (V). There is more than one 
way of  measuring amplitude.<P>
<P>
INTRODUCTION<P>
<P>
   What we are trying to do is get information from one place to  lots of others.  I'm  using  information 
here in  a  wider  sense,   meaning speech,  music, etc., rather than phone numbers local  hairdressers or  
whatever.  Now I'm going to assume we're going   to  use  radio broadcasting to achieve this, which 
immediately  rules  out  things like  standing  on top of tall buildings and  shouting  out  really loud.  
We'll  also assume we've got this  info in the  form  of  an audio frequency signal, i.e. what comes  out of a 
tape recorder  or an  audio  mixer. You can't transmit  audio frequency signals  very easily so what we can 
do is import  the info in the audio frequency signal  onto a higher frequency  carrier signal. Two ways of  
doing this  are  AMPLITUDE  MODULATION and FREQUENCY MODULATION  (AM  and FM).<P>
   In  AM the amplitude of the carrier is determined at every  instant by  the  amplitude  of  the audio 
signal,  the  carrier   frequency remains constant. In FM, the frequency of the carrier  is determined at  
every  instant by the amplitude of the audio  signal,  and  the carrier amplitude remains constant.<P>
   Frequencies  between 30 MHz and 300 MHz are  known  as  Very   High Frequencies or VHF. This 
corresponds to wavelengths between   10  m and  1  m.  To  convert between wavelength and frequency   
use  the formula:  Wavelength (in meters)=300 / Frequency (in  MHz).<P>
<P>
FM<P>
<P>
   There  are  two  sorts of FM, known as Narrow Band FM  (NBFM)   and Wideband FM. They differ by 
the maximum allowable frequency   shift of  the  carrier  when  the transmitter is fully   modulated.  This 
frequency  shift is known as the DEVIATION.  Legal  CB  radios  use NBFM with a maximum deviation 
of 3 kHz.  Wideband FM is used by the national  broadcasting companies for  radio  broadcasting  and  for 
studio to transmitter links. The  standard maximum deviation for FM radio broadcasting in Europe is  75 
kHz. There is no simple way  to set the deviation of a  transmitter without a deviation meter which is  an  
expensive  piece of test gear. Probably the best way to  do this  is  to   vary the level of the audio signal  
going  into  the transmitter   (TX)  and  listen on a receiver,  until  your  signal sounds   about the same 
loudness as the other (legal?) broadcasting  stations. If you use too high a deviation you'll use a bigger  
than necessary chunk of the radio spectrum and be more likely to   cause interference with others, which 
will make you even more   unpopular with the DTI.<P>
   The police use NBFM as well, which is why if you listen to  them on an ordinary FM receiver, which is 
wideband, you can hear  more than one channel at a time.<P>
<P>
CHOOSING A FREQUENCY<P>
<P>
   If  your first action could be to reach for your receiver and  tune trough looking for a blank space, think 
again, for a  kick-off  the FM  broadcast band is 88 to 108 MHz. What stations  you can receive is  
determined by where you are, as well as by  the nature  of  and positioning of your aerial. If you look our  
old friend the  Maplin catalogue  we  find a  list  of  the  frequencies and locations of all FM broadcasting 
stations. What  it doesn't  say, of course, is the frequency of existing pirates.   TX Magazine  gives a good 
rundown of these. Armed with this info   you should  make  a list of all frequencies in use in, say,  a   50  
km radius.  If you write to the BBC or IBA's Engineering Info  Offices they'll send you service maps of 
where their TX's are  meant to  be able  to  heard. Then its just a question of finding  a big  enough gap 
between stations, with the proviso that your  station shouldn't be  nearer than 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) to the  
frequency of any existing station. This is no problem as the band  is half empty. Also  don't choose  a 
frequency which is 10.7 MHz  away from any other  station as  for  complex  reasons (which  involve the 
use of  10.7  MHz  as intermediate frequency in FM  receivers) reception will be hard for people listening 
to you  and/or the other station.<P>
   Now let's take a little stroll through the whole system.<P>
<P>
TAPE OR LIVE<P>
<P>
   What  we  are  going to feed to our TX? The obvious   possibilities are:<P>
<P>
A) A tape or cassette player.<P>
B) Live, either directly from the mixer or via some kind of   link from studio to TX site (highly 
recommended).<P>
<P>
TAPE.  This is the safest approach in that you can put a  tape   on and then retire to a safe distance. Links 
are now being traced  and studios busted, and some of the biggest pirates (e.g. the  LWR) are going back 
to taped broadcasts. If the DTI trace your  transmission and turn up all they can do to confiscate your tape  
player, TX and aerial, i.e. no arrests (unless they catch you  changing the tape).<P>
   Its also the most inflexible alternative as tapes will have to   be prepared  in  advance. Time checks, if 
you're into that,  will   be difficult and live phone ins are right out.<P>
   Give  a little thought to your choice of tape recorder, as it  will probably be the weakest link in terms of 
sound quality. In  an  old clapped out one the heads will be worn flat. Maybe you  can  use  a 'Walkman' 
type of player, which are small, can be  battery  powered and  have an OK sound quality and are cheap. 
An  amateur radio rally I was at recently were selling off very  slightly damaged ones for £2  each.  To 
reduce 'noise' or 'tape  hiss' on such recorders,  if you're doing programs with quiet  passages, you can use 
a circuit known  as  a Dynamic Noise  Limiter (DNL), which is placed  on  the output  and  cuts off the  
'noise' just in quiet pauses.  DNLs  are sometimes used in the  soundtracks of old films. You can find a 
DNL circuit in part of  the 'Audio Embellisher' project in the Jan.  84 issue of  'Elektor' magazine.<P>
   If you want to go upmarket you could use a proper 1/4"  reel to tape recorder, though few pirates do. The 
latest and greatest is to  use  'Stack  machines' which will change the  tapes for you.<P>
   Whatever  you use get one that can be battery powered as  you   may not always have access to mains 
power.<P>
<P>
MONO OR STEREO<P>
<P>
   The advantages of mono are that the TX is kept as simple and  cheap as  possible, and you don't need as 
much power as on stereo  to get same   result.   The  disadvantages  are  you   don't    sound   as 
professional,  quite small pirates are now using  Stereo  Encoders, and  maybe  people might dial past 
when the red   stereo  light  on their  receivers doesn't flash. With stereo the  listener  can  get quality  the  
same of legal stations. Weigh  against  this  is  the extra  cost, extra circuitry and more  output power 
needed for  the same signal.<P>
   What  you  need is a STEREO ENCODER, which combines the  left   and right  stereo signals into a 
single composite stereo signal   which is then fed into your TX.<P>
   For those interested a brief description follows. The left (L)  and right  (R) signals are fed into a 
summing and differential  amp  to get a L+R and L-R signal respectively. The L-R signal is  mixed  in a  
balanced  modulator  with a 38 kHz sub carrier  to   produce  an amplitude modulated double sideband 
suppressed  carrier signal. The 38  kHz signal is derived from the same  source as the 19 kHz pilot tone. 
The composite output is formed  by mixing the L+R signal, the sidebands containing the info of  the L-R 
signal, and a bit  of  19 kHz  pilot tone. The pilot tone  switches on the STEREO DECODER  in peoples' 
receivers.<P>
   Back  in  the receiver, once the stereo decoder has extracted   the L+R  and L-R signal the original left 
and right signals are  easily got by   (L+R)+(L-R)=2L (L+R)-(L-R)=2R.<P>
   The reason L+R and L-R signals are encoded rather than L and R is so that a mono receiver can just 
demodulate the L+R bit and  ignore the  rest  of the signal. If L and R signals were encoded   a  mono 
receiver would only be able to hear the left channel. The 19  kHz pilot  tone is usually got from a crystal 
oscillator, to be quite accurate and stable. A crystal resonating on 4.8640 MHz is convenient  as  4864 
divided by 2 eight times is 19. This can easily  be done  by digital logic chips, but its highly unlikely that  
you'll be  able to buy a 4.8640 crystal off the shelf, so  you'll have  to have one made for order.<P>
   It  doesn't matter if you didn't understand all of the  above   but one  thing is important. The standard 
FM broadcast audio  bandwidth extends only to 15 kHz and stereo encoders are designed  to  assume this  
figure. If you put signals into them with  frequencies  above that  the  L+R  signal and the lower side band  
of the  L-R  signal could spread into each other and you will get  a right bloody mess.<P>
   With a tape recorder you can't really get over 15 kHz,  but   if you're  live its quite possible. In that case 
you need a LOW   PASS FILTER  on  each  input to a stereo encoder. Maplin  has  a   high quality  
design. The pot  could  be replaced with a 500k  resistor to wire the circuit permanently  for max.  roll off. 
If  you're using a link between studio and  TX  and you want stereo  you'll have to know the bandwidth of 
the link.  If its  53  kHz   (=38+15) or more you can use it after  the  encoder.<P>
   Otherwise you'll need two links and have to encode at the TX  end.<P>
<P>
PRE-EMPHASIS<P>
<P>
   In  a  typical  audio signal the high frequency sounds  have   less energy  than  the  low ones and so 
produce less deviation   of  the carrier.  This  in  turn  makes them  susceptible  to   noise  when received. 
To avoid this high frequencies are boosted  before  being transmitted  by PRE-EMPHASIS. In the receiver 
the  frequencies  are cut  by  the same amount by DE-EMPHASIS. So the  overall  frequency response of 
TX to receiver stays flat, but the  level of background noise is reduced a lot.<P>
   Pre-  and  de-emphasis networks are characterized  by  their   TIME CONSTANT. In the USA the 
standard is 75 us, but in UK its 50  us so anything  designed or bought from there needs slight  
modification.<P>
   In a mono TX the pre-emphasis network can be built into the  front end of the exciter. For a stereo TX 
such a network must not  be  in the  exciter  or it'll play hell with the composite stereo signal from  the  
encoder.  Instead you need 2  networks,  one   for  each channel,  on  the  inputs of the stereo encoder.  
They're  actually often built into the studio encoder.<P>
<P>
COMPRESSORS AND LIMITERS<P>
<P>
   Compressors and limiters operate on the same principles, but  their effects and the reasons for using 
them are completely  different.<P>
   A compressor compresses, it reduces the DYNAMIC RANGE of its  input signal.  This means as the 
input amplitude varies over  a   certain range,  the output amplitude varies only a fraction of  that 
range.<P>
   A  limiter  passes its signal unchanged till the input   amplitude reaches  its  THRESHOLD. At this 
point the  limiter   prevents  the output increasing much by compressing its input  much more strongly 
than in compressors e.g. 10:1.<P>
   Some  American  music  stations and some  pirates  compress   their programs  to  make  it seem louder 
and more upfront  than   other stations.  This occurs because the compressor keeps the average   level of 
the signal high, even in quiet parts of the program. The  flip side of  this  is listeners can soon get 'listener 
fatigue'  as constant compression can become boring and irritating to the  ear, as if the music were 
rammed into it!<P>
   Compression  has other uses, you might compress your program   as you  transfer  it  to  tape  to  stop  
quieter  bits  fading   into background  tape  hiss when played. The process of   recording  and playing 
does this to some extent anyway. Don't  compress the output of  a  tape recorder as it'll make tape noise  
worse. Guitar effect units,  labelled  compressors,  are   unlikely  to  be  much   use. Compressors  
intended for use in  home studio recording  are  worth experimenting  with. A stereo  compressor with a 
2:1 characteristic can be simply constructed  around a NE571 IC.<P>
   Limiters  are  used  to  stop a signal's amplitude  going   over  a certain  level.  E.g.  when  cutting  a  
master  disc  in record manufacture, large PA systems at gigs to stop loudspeakers  blowing every  time  
someone  burps in a mike and, surprise   surprise,  in broadcasting. In FM particularly, as the signal  level 
increases so also  does  the  bandwidth  of  the   transmitted  signal,  risking interfering  with other 
stations.  With tape input to  the  TX  its different  the  output  is   inherently limited  by  the  recording 
process,  no  limiter   needed. With  live  input  to  the  TX  its different.  Though  you might set the levels 
right to start,  along comes a loud  record or voice and you could be interfering with the next  station. Use 
a limiter.<P>
   Any  limiters based on 2 back to back diodes is a little more  than a guitar fuzz box and will sound like 
one. A suitable high  quality limiter was described in the May 83 issue of 'Electronics   Today' 
International Magazine.<P>
<P>
THE OSCILLATOR<P>
<P>
   At  the  heart of everything is the OSCILLATOR that generates   the VHF  signal.  The frequency of 
this is modulated  by   applying  an audio signal to it. The most common way of doing  this is using one or  
two  VARICAP diodes. When a varicap diode  is operated  with  a reverse  bias the capacitance of the 
diode  varies with that  bias.<P>
   The  diode(s) is/are connected to a frequency determining part   of the oscillator. The audio signal is 
connected across the diode   to achieve frequency modulation. Also by varying the DC reverse   bias the  
oscillator  can be fine tuned. The higher  the   voltage,  the lower the capacitance, the higher the 
frequency.<P>
   The  VHF  signal can be generated directly, or the oscillator   can oscillate  on a lower frequency e.g. a 
third or half that   desired and  then followed by a TRIPLER or DOUBLER stage. There  are  three main 
types of oscillator:  <P>
<P>
a) Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO)           <P>
b) Crystal Oscillator<P>
c) Phase Locked Loop oscillator (PLL)<P>
<P>
VFO's<P>
<P>
   These  are  simple oscillators which can be built round  a   single transistor. This can be a Bipolar 
Junction Transistor  (BJT)  or  a Field Effect Transistor (FET). <P>
   The  problem with oscillators based on BJT's is that the  frequency is  too dependent on the temperature 
of the transistor.  i.e. a few degrees  temperature  change will result a significant   change  in transmitting 
frequency. For this reason oscillators  based on BJT's are  UNSUITABLE for serious use as a TX. FET's  
don't  suffer  from this  problem so badly, so they can be used,  but you should  still bear it in mind.<P>
   The  FET's will heat itself up slightly, and other bits of the  TX, like  the power amps, will be fair old 
pumping heat out, and   are usually  built into the same case as the oscillator. The  frequency will  drift  
most  when the TX is first switched  on   as  all  the components will be at the same temperature as the  
air outside  the TX's case, this is known as the AMBIENT  TEMPERATURE. After the  TX is  turned on 
the heat from the amps  will warm the air in the case directly or indirectly. As the FET  warms the 
frequency will  drift a bit. When heat loss equals heat  gain you get THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM and  it  
won't  drift more. Keep  your TX out of  drafts  to  avoid messing this up. If you have a  frequency counter 
plug it in  to  a dummy  load and see how long  it takes for the frequency  displayed to  settle down, maybe  
about 15 minutes. If you have time you  can arrive  at the TX  site early and run your TX for the warm up  
time with  no input  to a dummy load. This avoids listeners who tune  in immediately  having to retune as 
your frequency drifts.<P>
<P>
CRYSTAL OSCILLATORS<P>
<P>
   This is also simple oscillator but incorporates a crystal into  the frequency determining network. There 
are various types of   crystals (fundamental, 3rd overtone, 5th overtone etc.) and  various ways of using 
them (series mode, parallel mode) but their  basic properties are  the  same.  They're  resonant  on  one 
frequency which is determined by the crystal's  characteristics when made.  This  is their  problem,  
whereas  a   VFO's are  not  very  stable  crystal oscillators  are too bloody  stable and it's a job  to  get  
enough deviation.  You'll  probably lose the higher frequencies  of  your program and stereo  is right out. 
Also chances are you'll have to get a crystal made  order for your desired frequency so if you want to 
change it  you'll need a new one.<P>
<P>
PHASE LOCKED LOOP (PLL) OSCILLATORS<P>
<P>
   The   way  its  done  properly  is  with  the  phase  locked   loop oscillator. This combines the ease of 
tuning and wide  deviation of a  VFO  with  the frequency stability of a crystal  oscillator.  It works  thus:  
A crystal oscillator is used to  provide a  reference frequency.  This  is  digitally  divided  by   logic  chips  
to   a relatively  low frequency, say 25 kHz. A VFO  provides the  output, which  is  also  digitally divided 
to give another relatively  low frequency. These two low frequencies are  presented to a PHASE  
COMPARATOR  which  basically decides which   frequency  is  higher  by comparing  the  phases  of the 
two  signals. The  phase  comparator generates an ERROR VOLTAGE which  is connected back to the 
input of the VFO through a low pass  filter. This is the loop bit.<P>
   If the VFO is running too fast the phase comparator decreases  the error  voltage so as to slow it down 
till the phases at its   input are  the  same.  If  its  running too slow the  error   voltage  is increased  to  
speed  it till the phases are the   same.  All  this happens  instantaneously of course so the output 
frequency remains constant.<P>
   In this way the temperature stability of the VFO isn't  important and it can be built round a BJT, as its 
output  frequency is phase locked to the crystal oscillator, and the  frequency is very good.<P>
   Two  more  things  to  explain.  How  do  you  change  the   output frequency? By making the VFO's 
divider programmable. Say   its  set to divide by the number N. The phase comparator is a  simple minded 
sort  of  soul, concerned only with equalizing the  phases  at  its inputs, it doesn't know what's really 
coming out  of the VFO, which is N times the divided reference signal.  Because this signal is so low  
compared to the VFO frequency N  can be made to have  hundreds of   different   values,  giving   
hundreds  of  different   output frequencies from the VFO. So  changing the frequencies  is  just  a matter 
of clicking some  little switches.<P>
   Hang  on a second, the VFO is being frequency modulated by the   audio input,  so  its  frequency at any 
given  instant  depends   on  the voltage of the audio output. We don't want this variation   of  the VFO's  
frequency to be ironed out by the PLL system, so   we  'iron out'  the  error  voltage from the phase 
comparator,   so  it  just contains  the  underlying trend rather than what's   happening  any split second. 
This is purpose of the low pass  filter.<P>
  The  system can be simplified by leaving out the dividers. If  this is  done you end up with an output 
frequency determined  solely  by the  crystal.  You've still got the wide deviation   capability  of course, 
which distinguishes this system from one  based on a simple crystal  oscillator.  This sort of fixed  
frequency  oscillator  is used  for things like wireless mikes  and could be used for  studio to  TX  links. 
Programmable PLL  oscillators are used in all manner of professional communication  equipment, 
including broadcast TX's.<P>
<P>
BUFFERS<P>
<P>
   Any  oscillator, regardless of its type, is followed by a   buffer. This  is usually one or two transistors 
operating in what  is known as  class  A mode. Its function is to protect the  oscillator  from what  is  
going  on  further  along the circuit,   especially  from changes  in  its  'load'  as the following   stage  is  
tuned.  The combination  of  oscillator  and buffer   together  is  called  the EXCITER  and is a small but 
fully  fledged TX. Small in respect  to its  output power. Typical  values are in the region of 100  -  500 
mW.<P>
<P>
AMPLIFIERS<P>
<P>
   To  increase the power output of our fledgling TX we need to  add an amplifier.  Obviously we are 
talking about radio   frequency  (RF), not audio amps. RF amps have certain important  
characteristics:<P>
<P>
a) Bandwidth<P>
b) Gain and maximum power output<P>
c) Input and output impedance<P>
<P>
BANDWIDTH.  This  is the range frequencies the  amp  will   amplify properly.   The   bandwidth   is   
ultimately   limited    by   the characteristics of the active devices in the amp (i.e.  transistors or  valves), 
but more specifically by its type,  LINEAR or a  TUNED amplifier.<P>
   A linear amp will amplify quite a large range of frequencies   and they have a good bandwidth, 
commonly 1.8 - 30 MHz which  covers all of  the  amateur shortwave broadcast bands... no good   for  a  
VHF pirate, but could be useful for a AM pirate. They  operate in class A  or B mode and have the 
advantage that they  don't need adjusting when the frequency is changed. Their  disadvantage are they're 
more complex  and dearer than tuned amps  and are much harder to design, requiring  extensive 
knowledge of  the transistors round which  the amp is constructed. Linear amps  for VHF are 
uncommon.<P>
   Tuned amps only amplify a narrow band of frequencies, they  have  a small  bandwidth, centered on one 
frequency which is  determined  by the  TUNED CIRCUITS in the input and output  networks of  the  
amp. Tuned  circuits have a RESONANT frequency.  This can be adjusted  by variable  capacitors known 
as trimmers,  to the desired  frequency.<P>
   The  amp  will produce max. output when the tuned circuit  resonant frequency  is  the same as the input 
frequency from  the   exciter. Tuned  amps  often  operate in the class C  mode,  which   is  more efficient  
than A or B. This means more of the power   being  drawn from the battery or whatever turns into watts 
up the  aerial rather than  heat the amp. They are relatively simple  circuits,  and  are easier  to  design. 
The bandwidth is a  trade-off  with  gain,  the wider  the  bandwidth, the less the  gain. The disadvantages  
of  a tuned amp is of course you have to  tune it to the frequency you're using  and  if you change the  
frequency you'll have to  retune  to maintain the gain of the  amp.<P>
<P>
GAIN AND MAXIMUM OUTPUT POWER<P>
<P>
   The  POWER GAIN (as opposed to a voltage or current gain which   is different)  of an amp is defined 
as a ratio:   Power gain=  Output power / Input power, and is a measure  of the  amps  ability to make its 
input bigger. Power gains are  often  expressed in DECIBELS (dB) which are defined: <P>
<P>
Power gain (dB) = 10 log(Output power / Input power).<P>
<P>
   Amps  also  have  a  max.  output  power.  When  this  is   reached increasing the input power won't 
result in more output   power  and may damage the amp.<P>
   In  the  case of single stage (i.e. one transistor) class C   tuned amps  the  gain and max. output power of 
the amp is  basically  the gain and max. output power of the transistor.  Knowing these we can calculate  
the  power necessary to produce  the max. output  power. e.g. lets consider the popular MRF237  
transistor. According to the makers' data sheet this has a max.  output power of 4  watt  and  a gain  of  12 
dB. First we've to  convert the gain in dB to ordinary gain:     Gain=10^(gain (dB) /  10) for example:  
Gain=10^(12/10) = 10^1.2 = 15.8               Input Power = Output power / Gain = 4 / 15.85 = 0.25.<P>
<P>
   So  for  4  watt  output power we need 250 mW  input  power.   Most exciters  can manage this, hence 
the popularity of the   MRF237  in the first amp after the exciter. The joker in the pack  is that all these  
figures are for a frequency of 175 MHz, that  on  which  the transistor was designed. You can't predict 
what  happens at 100 MHz and have to experiment.<P>
   The  MRF238  has 30 watt output power and a gain of 9  dB,  so   it needs  3.8  watt  input power. This 
can be had  from  the   MRF237. That's how the makers (Motorola Corpse.) planned it.<P>
<P>
INPUT AND OUTPUT IMPEDANCE<P>
<P>
   Impedance  is the alternating current (AC) version of   resistance.<P>
   The  standard impedance of exciters and inputs and outputs of  amps is  50 . The impedance of the input 
and the output networks  of  an amp  is  altered by the tuned circuits which you recall  also  tune the 
circuit in a tuned amp. The INPUT IMPEDANCE is  important as it effects the LOAD the amp has on the 
stage before  it. Max. power is transferred  between stages when the impedance  of the  output  and input 
are equal. If the impedances aren't  equal a MISMATCH is said to  occur and in this case some energy  is 
reflected back from  the input  of a stage into the output of  the preceding one, where  its wasted as 
heat.<P>
<P>
THE VSWR METER<P>
<P>
   Some  of you may know that we can use a VSWR meter (also known   as Voltage Standing Wave Ratio 
meter, SWR meter or a   Reflectometer) to  detect mismatch between TX and the aerial, but  a VSWR 
meter is just  as much at home doing this between amp  stages. VSWR  is  the ratio of the forward (or 
incident) and  reflected power. Except for dear ones they work the same. The  switch is set to forward or  
the SET button is pressed. The knob  is then adjusted to make the meter read  full scale. The switch  is 
then set to reverse or the  button is  pre-released.  It now  indicates the VSWR. A  VSWR  of  1:1  is 
perfect  (no reflected  power) and so unlikely. One of  00:1  shows all the power is  reflected back into the 
amp, you'll get this with a VSWR  connected to the amp output with nothing on the VSWR output  (unless  
its  got a built in dummy load). You'll also  get  it   if there's  a short circuit in the VSWR meter. In either 
case   switch off IMMEDIATELY or you'll blow your power transistor.<P>
   The point of all this is to get the max. power output from the  amp into the aerial, instead of a hot TX 
and a bad signal.<P>
   To  tune  such an amp you need a load connected to the output   (or it'll  blow  up).  We could use an 
aerial but this   introduces  an extra  unknown quantity... the characteristics of  the  aerial.  As well  as  
the fact that we'd be broadcasting.  What we  need  is  a DUMMY LOAD.<P>
<P>
THE DUMMY LOAD<P>
<P>
   This  is basically a resistor, made so it presents a load  to   the amp's  output independent of frequency 
(unlike the aerial).  The  3 things about a dummy load we're interested are:<P>
<P>
a) It  should be suitable for the frequency we're interested  in, about 100 MHz.<P>
b) It should be rated to take the power we're trying to make.<P>
c) It should have a resistance of 50 to match the output network of the amp.<P>
<P>
   When  buying  ask  for  one for the 2 meter band,  amateur   radio, centered  on  145 MHz. Most test 
gear  for this band will   work  on frequencies we're interested in.<P>
   The  amp should first be tuned with reduced input power and  supply voltage.  Adjust  the  network for 
the best  input  match   (lowest reading  on  a VSWR meter connected to the input side)  and  adjust the 
output trimmers for max. output power. Be sure  the extra power is  in the frequency you want and not in 
the  HARMONICS. Check with a  wave meter (more of this coming up).  Another VSWR meter can  be 
used  for  a relative indication of  the output power,  or  the  RF PROBE will give an absolute  indication. 
The pairs of trimmers  are very  interdependent,  adjust one and you'll  have  to  adjust  the other, and so 
on.<P>
   This  done, if all OK, increase the input power by increasing   the voltage  supply to the previous stage, 
and the voltage supply   and repeat  the  tuning. Do all this a few times till  you  reach   the required  
levels. Listen on a nearby (but not too near)   receiver. The  signal should be in just one place on the dial  
with no  funny noises  or modulations going on. Check with a  wavemeter.  Altering the trimmers and 
varying the input power and  supply voltage should result in smooth variations of the supply  current and 
output power with  no  steps or jumps. The exception  is, as the input power  is reduced  at  some point the 
amp will  switch off, a characteristics of class C amps.  <P>
   To  vary  the supply voltage you need a Variable Stabilized   Power Supply  Unit.  If you can't get hold 
of one you could   build  one. They're  not  expensive  and are well handy,  and   give  you  some 
experience, if needed, of electronic  construction.<P>
<P>
HARMONICS<P>
<P>
   Harmonics  are  multiples  of the transmitting  frequency.   For  a frequency   of  100  MHz,  the  first  
harmonic,  known    as   the FUNDAMENTAL, is 100 MHz, the second is 200 MHz, the  third  is  300 
MHz  etc. They're produced as side effects in  various parts of the circuit  and  will interfere with other  
users of these frequencies if  let  escape from the TX. Known as  RADIO FREQUENCY 
INTERFERENCE (RFI). Tuned class C amps don't  amplify harmonics, as they're  out of  the range of the 
amps  abilities. But the use of class C  means that  harmonics  are  generated by the amp along with  the  
desired frequency.  The   strongest ones (apart from the fundamental)  from such amps are  usually the 
third, then the fifth etc. The amplitude of   harmonics  is  minimized  if the  output  networks  are  
tuned<P>
properly,  but  they're still there. Oscillators and  buffers   can also make harmonics if not set up right.<P>
<P>
WAVEMETERS<P>
<P>
   To  detect  harmonics  we  need an ABSORPTION  WAVEMETER,   usually called just a wavemeter. 
Or we can use a GRID DIP  OSCILLATOR (GDO) or  a  gate dip oscillator, both of which are  known as 
DIP METERS.<P>
   Most dip meters have a switch which turns them into  wavemeters.  A wavemeter  has  a  tuning knob, 
calibrated in  frequency,  a  meter showing  signal strength, and some kind of  aerial.  You  hold  the 
aerial near a coil in the bit of the  circuit you're interested in, and tune the wavemeter. It shows  how much 
signal is present on the frequencies  shown in the  scale. So you can see  what  frequencies are  being  
generated in  that part of the circuit. Ideally  you'll just  find  the   fundamental, unless the circuit  is  a  
frequency tripler or  something.<P>
   If  you  buy  a wavemeter be sure it covers the right range,   from below  100 MHz to get the 
fundamental to above 300 MHz to  get  the third harmonic.<P>
   Even  with  all  tuned  right you're  still  going  to  have   some harmonics generated by the last stage. A 
sensible pirate  won't let these reach the aerial, e.g. if you're using a  frequency of 100.35 MHz the third 
harmonic us 307.05 MHz which  happens to be that used by USAF  Upper Heyford's Control Tower.  You 
might think  this  is funny  but  you won't stay on the air  for long. To stop  harmonics reaching the aerial 
we need a  BANDPASS FILTER.<P>
   Each  amp bumps up the power some more, because the transistor in  each one can only supply so much 
gain. So if you're the proud  owner  of a 5 watt transmitter and you're offered a 1000 watt amp its  useless 
as you'd need  probably 100 watt input to drive it so  you'd  need  amps  in between.<P>
   To  tune a series of amps on your TX you must break in,  physically if  needed,  to  tune  each one at 
time. Do  this  by   unsoldering components  and  soldering in short bits of coax   with  plugs  to connect 
to dummy load and VSWR meter.<P>
<P>
BANDPASS FILTER<P>
<P>
   This filter only allows through a narrow band of frequencies,  i.e. it has a narrow bandwidth, a good one 
would be less than 1  MHz. It needs standard 50  input and output impedance and be able  to  take power  
you're using and be tuned to the frequency you  want to  let through.  Other frequencies are reduced 
drastically,  by an  amount known  as  INSERTION LOSS. It reduces also the   desired  frequency slightly.  
To keep this loss low bandpass  filters for high  output powers are usually pretty chunky  numbers.<P>
   Pirate  gear doesn't have this filter built into the final   stages so if you need one you have to add it on. It 
needs a well  screened case  to stop harmonics leaking out. In fact your whole  TX  should be  well 
screened for the same reason. Say e.g. you  used a shoebox and had your oscillator on a third of a 
frequency  of 92.25 MHz you could  be interfering with pagers of a local  hospital as they  use 31.75  
MHz. Proper screening and a bandpass  filter will  eliminate such possibilities.<P>
<P>
CONNECTORS<P>
<P>
   As  you  may have guessed you can't use any connectors on  VHF   as they  have to match the amp and 
feeder. Use BNC or the UHF  series.<P>
   UHF  is  best for higher powers as you can get a wider cable   into the plug. N type is also good but more 
expensive.<P>
<P>
FEEDERS<P>
<P>
   So  you've got your nice clean harmonic free signal coming out   of your bandpass filter... we're on the 
home run. All that's left   is to  get  the signal up the aerial feeder to the aerial  and   we're away. BUT the 
aerial cable needs to MATCH the TX's output  stage at one  end  and  the aerial at the other. The cable  
like   the  TX's output,  the  connectors and the aerial has an   impedance  and  to match  this should be 50 
. It also needs a LOW  LOSS or your  watts will  escape  as heat. Not the same as a bad  VSWR where  
you  lose energy  in  the  TX, a good VSWR does not  mean the  cable's  okay.<P>
   Decent  cables for short runs are UR76 and RG56U. For longer   runs or higher powers use UR67.<P>
<P>
AERIALS<P>
<P>
   At  last,  the aerial! You can run a pirate knowing  a  little   of TX's,  but  if  you  know nothing of 
aerials  you'll  have  a   few listeners.  So  you must read a book on it. I recommend  'The   Two Meter 
Antenna Handbook' by F.C. Judd G2BCX. Lot's of it isn't  useful but he goes into things like propagation, 
matching, VSWR  in better detail.  All the dimensions he gives are for the two  meter amateur band,  
centered  in  145 MHz. To convert to other   frequencies  all dimensions (including diameter of aerial 
element  etc.)  should  be divided by your frequency in MHz and then  multiplied by 145.<P>
<P>
POLARIZATION<P>
<P>
   One thing to decide is what polarization to use. The main ones  are HORIZONTAL  and  VERTICAL. 
To simplify you can say a   horizontally placed  aerial produces horizontally polarized radio  waves  and  a 
vertically  placed  one vertically polarized ones.   To  receive  a horizontally  polarized  signal you need a  
horizontally  polarized aerial,  and  for  vertical one you need   a  vertically  polarized aerial.  Most 
receivers on FM have  horizontally polarized aerials, but all car aerials are  vertically polarized. So what 
polarization you  go  for  depends  on the audience you expect. E.g.  on  Sunday afternoon you'd  expect 
people at home so use horizontal, while  in rush hour you  might favor vertical. You can build an aerial 
which splits the  power between both, as used in legal stations, known as MIXED   polarization. But the 
effect of radio  waves  bouncing  off buildings etc. tends to twist the polarization of your signal  from 
horizontal to vertical and vice versa, so your signal could   still be picked up by the wrong aerial.<P>
   Your  transmitting site will affect you choice of aerial.  In   the middle of the area  you  want  to  cover  
you'll   need an OMNIDIRECTIONAL aerial which transmits equally each  ways, while outside your 
coverage area you can beam the  signal in with a DIRECTIONAL aerial.<P>
   The  simplest  possible aerial for VHF is known as the  HALF   WAVE DIPOLE. The elements can be 
bits of thin aluminum or copper  tube.<P>
   The impedance is about 75  which is close enough to 50 to be  fed from  50   cable without too much 
power loss. A half  wave   dipole used vertically is omnidirectional, but when used  horizontally  it has a 
fig of eight coverage which isn't very  useful. Also a dipole needs  a  balanced feed. You need a BALUN  
(BALance  to  UNbalance) transformer. These can be easily made  out of bits of coax  cable.<P>
   If  you  don't do this power will be radiated from the feeder.   An aerial  with  an  impedance greatly 
different from  50 needs an IMPEDANCE TRANSFORMER also made out of bits of coax cable.<P>
   Before going on air get a low VSWR by adjusting the  position   of the aerial and any adjustable pieces. 
Aim for 2:1 or less. Use  low power into the aerial when tuning it up and adjusting, if  using  a 100's  of 
watts and a bit came off in your hand the VSWR  could  be so  bad as to blow the final transistor. For the 
same  reason check the  continuity of the aerial with an ohmmeter  before plugging in, to  be sure its what 
its meant to be, either  a short circuit or an open  one,  depending  on the type. A  dipole  should  be  an  
open circuit.<P>
<P>
SITING<P>
<P>
   Siting  is  very important. Height is the main factor,  even   more than watts! Since VHF radio waves go 
almost in straight  lines, 100 watt  in your front room will only reach your  neighbors, while  5 watt  up 
high and unblocked will go 10 km's  or more. The waves  do bend  a bit so you'll cover more than you  can 
see but its hard  to say how much.<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME = III></A>III. Operation of 
a Pirate Radio Station: A look at Pirating in 
the United States.</H1>
PREFACE<P>
   It is the opinion of the author that many pirate radio  stations are founded upon the principle of novelty.  
That is,  their founders either find it amusing to inch over the lines of  the law, or they get a certain kick 
out of doing something to  make themselves different from their peers.  Such stations seem  unworthy of 
the label, "pirate radio station."<P>
   In a world of increasing regulation and control, deviance from  established modes of behavior is 
tolerated less and less.  New  ways are constantly being discovered by the government to  discourage 
deviant behavior.  The broadcast community is already  regulated by the government and extremely 
limited in its ability  to present alternative expressions.  Pirate radio stations enjoy  an unfettered ability to 
present alternative ideas and music and  thus are a source of free expressions not carrying the government 
stamp of approval.<P>
   The operation of a pirate radio station is likely to create  some controversy if its audience is substantial 
enough.  This  controversy is likely to attract the attention of the authorities  who are less than happy 
when during the course of exercising  their First Amendment rights, people present ideas not approved  of 
by the establishment.  Thus, it behooves those who would  operate a pirate radio station to prepare for the 
inevitable attempts by the law enforcement community to apprehend the responsible individuals and to 
shut the operation down.  This  exposition is written with the goal of making law enforcement's  objectives 
just a little bit more challenging to realize.<P>
   Careful choices regarding the station location, duration of  broadcasts, time of broadcasts, and frequency 
of broadcasts need  to be made in order to minimize the chances of being caught by  the authorities.<P>
   Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to operate a  pirate radio station from a building you 
regularly frequent (e.g.  home or office). This is asking to be caught.  You should choose  between 
operation from a vehicle or man-portable operation. If  you choose to broadcast from within a vehicle, 
several factors  should be considered when choosing a broadcast location.  In  addition to the obvious goal 
of maximizing your elevation for  good signal propagation, you should select a location that is  well 
hidden or not likely to arouse anyone's suspicion and you  should consider any difficulties that may come 
up should you need  to leave suddenly and quickly.<P>
   The location you broadcasts from should not arouse the  suspicion of any passing vehicles.  An ideal 
location would be  one that is well hidden from all roadways and far enough away  from any buildings so 
as not to attract the attention of their  residents.  In addition, there should be more than one path away  
from your broadcast location should need for a hasty retreat  become necessary.<P>
   In order to locate "undesirable" radio transmissions, the  authorities will utilize direction finding (DF 
for short) radio  equipment.  Direction finding equipment utilizes a highly  directional antenna coupled to 
a tuner and a field strength  meter.  After the desired frequency has been selected with the  tuner, the 
operator rotates the DF antenna until he obtains a  peak reading on the field strength meter and then notes 
the heading the antenna is pointed in.  Next, a vector is drawn on a  map beginning at the operators 
current location and extending in  the direction of the DF antenna's heading.  Assuming the  
"undesirable" radio transmission hasn't moved, successive  readings from different locations should result 
in vectors that  intersect at the origin of the transmission.  In practice,  because of limitations on the 
accuracy of the equipment, it is  not possible to precisely determine the location of the  transmitter from 
the first set of readings.  Usually, additional  sets of readings will be necessary before the location of the  
transmitter can be narrowed down sufficiently to allow a ground search for it.<P>
   In order to thwart DF equipment, you must be willing to either  limit the length of your transmissions 
such that the authorities  have insufficient time to locate your radio transmissions, or you  must operate 
from a moving vehicle.  Although possible, neither  of these options is particularly attractive, and 
alternatives do  exist.<P>
   If you are fortunate enough to live in a location with  significant areas of forest nearby, these can often 
be ideal  locations from which to stage your broadcasts.  At nighttime, the  authorities are very unlikely to 
venture into the woods in order  to locate a pirate radio station.  They are far too vulnerable in  such 
situations and generally will not pursue a suspect unless  the odds are overwhelmingly in their favor.  
Rather, they will  cover any obvious means into or out of the woods (such as a  trail) or any roadways in 
the general vicinity of the  broadcasting and search any suspicious individuals or vehicles  they discover 
during the period of time immediately following the  broadcast.  By taking a few simple precautions, 
broadcasting from  within a forested area of reasonable size can be the best  alternative to mobile 
operation or 30-minute broadcasts.<P>
   It is advisable to first visit the location you intend to  broadcast from during the day.  Pick a location not 
too close to  any roads or paths and make sure you will be able to find it in  the dark.  Relatively high 
points with a line-of-sight to your  listeners is another important thing to look for.  Think about  where 
you are going to put your antenna.  Is there a tree nearby  that will provide an ideal placement?  Can you 
climb it at night<P>
without risk of falling?  How much coax will you need to reach  the antenna from your broadcast location?  
Think about several  different paths of escape should the need arise.  Explore these  for a short distance to 
ascertain their viability.<P>
   After finding a good location to make your broadcasts from,  there will be a strong temptation to use 
that location again and  again for future broadcasts.  Unless you want to be caught,  resist this temptation.  
The authorities may have located a site  you have used previously, and could be waiting for you nearby the  
next time you try to broadcast.  Also, when you have finished  your broadcast and are packing up, keep in 
mind that anything you leave behind will help the authorities in their quest to find you and bring you to 
"justice."  Assume the authorities will scour the area shortly after you depart so make sure you leave 
nothing behind for them.  If there are smooth surfaces around, don't forget about fingerprints.  Either wear 
gloves during your broadcast, or spray everything you might have touched with a  degreaser before 
leaving.<P>
<P>
II.  AVOIDING THE AUTHORITIES<P>
(Detection and Evasion)<P>
   There are two phases to avoiding capture by the authorities.   In the first phase, the goal is to detect 
them well before they  have detected you.  In the second phase, the goal is to escape  without being 
detected or caught. Success in the first phase will  greatly influence the outcome of the second phase.<P>
   The authorities rely heavily upon radio for communication.  As  a result, it pays to purchase a decent 
scanner and become  familiar with its use and the operating procedures of the  authorities.  Frequency lists 
are available which list the  frequencies used by law enforcement in your area.  In addition,  books are 
available which list federal frequency assignments. You  should spend time going through such books and 
making a list of  frequencies you think may be used in the event a search for your  station were to be 
conducted.  Don't forget to include mutual-aid  frequencies in your list as they are often used when 
different  enforcement agencies want to coordinate with one another.  You  should spend some time in the 
general area you will be  broadcasting from listening to the scanner to determine which  frequencies on 
your list are appropriate for scanning and prune  the remainder from your list.  While it is generally better 
to  leave a questionable frequency on your list, irrelevant channels  may reduce the probability you will 
hear something important on  another channel.<P>
   Whenever possible, you should take along someone you trust to  your broadcast site and have them stand 
patrol.  They should wear  dark (black or camouflage) clothing and find a location to stand  where they 
have a good view of any obvious routes of approach to  your broadcast area.  A pair of walkie-talkies is 
ideal for  keeping in touch if you will be separated by more than a few tens  of feet.  Keep in mind that 
your transmissions could be monitored  so watch what you say.  Don't use names or other information  
which could give away your identity or location.  If you are  using flashlights, purchase some red tail-light 
tape at an auto  parts store and cover the lens with it to reduce your chances of  being seen and to maintain 
your night vision.<P>
   If there are just a couple of obvious routes leading to your  broadcast location, you might consider 
setting up perimeter  alarms along those routes.  Various party noise-makers are  commonly available at 
toy stores which make a bang when a string  to which they are attached is pulled.<P>
   Using some thin wire, tie one of these noise-makers between a  pair of trees through which the route you 
want to alarm passes  through.  Make sure the wire is obscured as much as possible to  minimize its 
chance of detection by any intruders.  Make sure you  set such alarms far enough away to give you enough 
time to make  your escape but close enough that you will be able to easily hear  them.<P>
   The key to successfully escaping from the authorities can be  summarized as follows:  DON'T PANIC.  
Proper planning is  essential.  You should have planned several routes of escape  beforehand and 
considered what to do with your equipment.  If  time allows, you will want to pack it up and take it with 
you. If  you need to escape quickly, hiding it may be your best option.   This might be as simple as 
covering it with something to  camouflage it.  Perhaps you even found a good place to set it up  that 
already takes advantage of natural cover and it is pretty  well hidden to begin with.  Assuming you are 
operating at night,  it also helps enormously to wear dark clothing and remove any  shiny objects such as 
jewelry or watches (leave them at home).<P>
   You will likely become aware of the authorities plans for you  through one of two means.  You will hear 
about a search on your  scanner or you will detect their physical presence.  In the  former case, you 
probably have plenty of time to pack up your  equipment and make a careful escape.  You may want to 
leave  incriminating evidence such as your equipment hidden somewhere  and come back later for it when 
the heat is off.  Plastic garbage  bags are ideal for protecting equipment left in the woods for a  few days.  
In the latter case, remaining calm and using your head  could will make the difference between being 
caught with your  pants down and just having a close call.<P>
   The instinctive reaction to the presence (impending or actual)  of the authorities is to flee.  The 
authorities know this and if  they are even marginally competent will have taken steps to  maximize their 
chances of capturing individuals mindlessly  running away.  Unless they have obviously seen you and are  
actively pursuing you, you should stop and force yourself to look  around and consider what options are 
open to you.  Approximately how many people are after you?  Are they far enough away that you can 
move away from them without them seeing or hearing you? Perhaps it would be best to try to remain 
hidden until they are far enough away that you can more safely risk slipping away?<P>
   Unless you are certain that your vehicle has not been detected  by the authorities (because it was 
extremely well hidden, or  parked with a number of other vehicles, for instance), then do  not approach it 
after your presence has been detected.  It is  very likely that the authorities will have discovered it and left  
someone behind to watch it.  By itself, the vehicle is little  more than weak circumstantial evidence to 
connect you with any  wrongdoing, but if you are caught returning to it (especially  with equipment), you 
will probably live to regret it.  You should  have previously considered other means of getting home if 
there  was trouble and follow those plans.<P>
III.  DEALING WITH THE AUTHORITIES<P>
(What to do when you get caught with your pants down)<P>
   There are at least two different ways of getting caught.  The  FCC could catch you and send you a notice 
of violation or the  police could catch you while broadcasting or while attempting to  flee them after 
broadcasting.  Two entirely different methods are  called for when dealing with each of these.<P>
   If you receive a FCC notice of violation, you are probably  best off ignoring it.  If they start getting 
serious about trying  to collect fines from you, I'd suggest picking up a copy of "How  to File for 
Bankruptcy" by Nolo Press.  It details a number of  different strategies for keeping bill-collectors out of 
your  pockets, and if necessary, tells you how to file for protection  from creditors (it helps if you don't 
have a lot of obvious  assets -- a house or expensive car, for instance).  You may also wish to discuss your 
options with an experienced attorney.<P>
   If you are apprehended by the police during a broadcast or  after an unsuccessful attempt at fleeing from 
them, remain calm.   They will ask you questions related to the incident for which you  have been 
apprehended. It is ok to answer questions about your  identity, but do not answer any questions related to 
any illegal  activities you have been involved with.<P>
   If you can get away with telling them you don't know the  answer to their question(s), do this, otherwise 
answer politely  but firmly that you cannot help them.  If it isn't obvious (e.g.  you have not been read your 
Miranda rights), ask them if you are  under arrest.  If not, you are free to go. If so, tell them you  would 
like to speak with your attorney before answering any  further questions and then KEEP YOUR MOUTH 
SHUT.  They may try to  trick you into incriminating yourself or providing them with  information that 
will assist them in building a case against you.   Do not help them!  Make sure any and all people that are 
with you  are thoroughly familiar with these procedures as one person  slipping up could have devastating 
results for everyone involved.<P>
   It's probably a good idea to carry the name and phone number  of an attorney specializing in criminal 
law with you whenever you  are involved in such activities.  Attorneys are very useful when  it comes to 
reducing the police's likelihood of violating your  civil rights and they can arrange to have you bailed out 
promptly  as well.<P>
Suggested Equipment<P>
Power:<P>
   Motorcycle batteries make ideal power sources.  They are  available in a number of different sizes.  A 
12-14AH battery will  power a typical 25- 35 watt station for at least two hours before  needing to be 
recharged. These batteries are light enough to be  carried in a backpack along with other equipment for 
several  miles by a single person if necessary.<P>
   You will also need to purchase some wire to connect the  motorcycle battery with the transmitting 
equipment.  For the  power amplifier, especially, make sure you don't use thin wire.   It could draw 5 
amperes or more which will not only cause thin  wires to get hot, but will also result in a substantial 
voltage  drop across the wires as a resulting loss of power output.  In  general, 18-gauge wire should be 
sufficient for amps up to 25-35  watts.<P>
   It is advisable to buy a cheap analog voltmeter that can be  clipped onto the battery during a broadcast to 
monitor its  condition.  Any sudden drop in voltage across the battery  indicates it is discharged, and 
measures should then be taken to  switch to another power source or end the broadcast.  Digital  
voltmeters are harder to read from a distance or at night and are  more expensive.<P>
Transmitting Equipment:<P>
   Obviously, you'll need an FM transmitter.  A number of kits  are available. Any kit that runs off of 12 
VDC will do.  If you  want your signal to propagate more than a few miles, you should  get a power 
amplifier, too. Power outputs around 25-35 watts are  ideal for portable operation with a motorcycle 
battery as the  power source.<P>
Antennas:<P>
   Most FM antennas have 300 ohms of impedance.  Most FM  transmitters and amplifiers expect a load of 
50 to 75 ohms.  It  is important to match the load the transmitter/amplifier sees to  the antenna in order to 
get as much signal out as possible and in  order to prevent damage to the transmitter/amplifier.  For  low-
power setups (under 5 watts or so), one way to do this is  with a common 75/300 ohm transformer.  These 
are sold at Radio  Shack.  They mate to a female F-connector, so it would be  advisable to get whatever 
adapter you need to mate your coax to  the transformer (most coax has BNC or UHF connectors on it).   
Running more power through this small transformer will probably  saturate it and cause the output signal 
to be distorted.<P>
   For higher power setups, you can make a 1/2-wave dipole with  two 1/4-wave lengths of wire and some 
coax.  The J-Pole antenna  is also relatively easy to make and very portable.  See, for  example, the ARRL 
Handbook (available at most libraries and many  bookstores) for instructions on making these and other 
antennas.   It should also be possible to build a 50 or 75/300 ohm  transformer to enable you to use 
commercial FM antennas with your  transmitter.  Once again, the ARRL Handbook is an ideal source of 
information for how to do this.<P>
   An SWR meter is an invaluable aid to checking the performance  of your FM antenna.  They should 
always be used anytime you are  transmitting with more than a watt or so of power in order to  detect a 
bad match between the transmitter and the antenna before  the transmitter becomes damaged.  Once 
again, Radio Shack sells  relatively inexpensive SWR meters that are adequate.  Better ones  can be 
obtained at your local amateur radio store.<P>
   Make sure you purchase enough coax cable to allow you to place  your antenna a reasonable distance 
from your transmitting  equipment.  50 feet is a good compromise between signal loss and  flexibility in 
antenna placement.  RG/58 is adequate for such  short runs of cable, but you should consider using RG/8X 
or RG/8  if you need longer runs of cable.<P>
Audio:<P>
   Many radio stations will want the ability to broadcast  pre-recorded material from a tape or CD as well 
as live material  from a microphone. A mixer is an essential piece of equipment for  such operation.  
Small, battery powered mixer decks are  inexpensive and available from Radio Shack.  By connecting 
them  between your microphone, CD player, tape player, and transmitting  equipment you will be able to 
switch between any of several  sources or mix them together.<P>
   If you want to use a portable CD player, bear in mind the  expected battery life of a fully charged cell, 
and make sure you  bring an extra if you plan a long broadcast.  Likewise for a  walkman.  Also, you will 
need an assortment of patch cables to  connect your CD player, walkman, microphone, and mixer 
together.   Once again, Radio Shack is a good source for pre-made cables of  this type.<P>
Miscellaneous:<P>
   It is advisable to bring along an FM radio.  This will allow  you to monitor your transmissions to make 
sure you are getting  good modulation and you are tuned to the frequency you want to  be.<P>
   A piece of foam or other material upon which to place  electronic equipment to keep it away from dirt 
and rocks is  advisable.  It is also good for sitting on. Strong, thin cord is  handy for tying up your antenna 
in a nearby tree or other tall  structure.<P>
   Head-lamps (head-mounted flashlights) are invaluable for  nighttime broadcasting.  Purchase some red 
tail-light-repair tape  at your local auto supply store and cover the lens with it to  turn the beam red and 
thus preserve your night vision.<P>
   Don't forget to bring along a bottle of water and some snacks  to eat during your broadcast.<P>
Security:<P>
   Buy yourself a decent scanner.  Next, get a copy of local,  state, and federal frequency assignments for 
your area.  Program  the scanner with the local police, sheriff's department, mutual  aid frequencies, and 
anything else you think might be relevant.   Spend some time monitoring the authorities to become 
familiar  with the operating practices of them.<P>
   A partner can be an invaluable aid during a pirate radio  broadcast.  Make sure he is someone you can 
trust!  While one  person operates the radio equipment, the other person can monitor  the scanner and 
watch the perimeter for intruders.  Walkie  Talkies are an ideal way for the DJ to stay in touch with his  
security.<P>

<H1><A NAME = IV></A>IV. How to be a 
Radio Pirate U.K.</H1>
    This section tells you exactly how to go ahead setting up  your own pirate  radio  with  all the tips 
learned from bitter   experience. First of all here's a list of main things you'll  need. So you want to be a 
radio pirate? Read on...<P>
What you'll need:<P>
A. A group of committed people who get on with each other and  have plenty of time and energy.<P>
B.  A  program,  presuming you have something  worth  saying  or  playing.  You  don't even need a 
studio to start  off  with.   Just borrow someone's stereo and a microphone and start making  practice 
recordings onto good quality cassette tapes.<P>
C.  A  Transmitter. Ideally over 10 watt power, but 5 watts is  fine for  local broadcasts, or when using an 
aerial with gain.   You can't  buy  one  over the counter in Britain, but  here   are  some alternatives:<P>
 I) Buy one from another pirate (beware of rip-offs).<P>
II) Buy one over the counter abroad. In Italy for instance   you can get a high quality 50 watt transmitter 
over the counter   for £200.  You  can  buy  kits in Belgium, France, Netherlands,   USA, etc. You then 
have to smuggle it home.<P>
III) Build your own. A hobbyist can  build  a  low  power   FM transmitter easily. Try to interest radio 
hams or dissident engineers. It's almost essential to have at least one  person  in your group with some 
technical know how.<P>
IV) Get one built to your specification. There are a few electronics engineers about who will build them 
for a   reasonable price.<P>
D.  Antenna.  You  can  adapt a design yourself  from  an   antenna handbook (e.g. The 2 Meter Antenna 
Book). Or use one of  our  ready made  designs. Look out for aluminum tubing or struts  which  make 
good building material.<P>
E.  Odds  and  ends.  You'll  need basic  tools  (soldering   iron, multimeter, SWR meter), a cheap cassette 
deck, probably one  or two good  car batteries, a roll of coax cable for the aerial,  a radio to  listen  in on, 
etc. Also start reading Amateur Radio  Handbooks and all relevant writings.<P>
VHF: Pros and Cons<P>
   First  lets deal with FM (Frequency Modulated) broadcasting,  which is  probably  your  choice. The 
advantages of  FM  are   many.  The transmitters  are  small and quite cheap. Reception   tends  to  be 
either very clear or non-existent. Its excellent  for music and for recording  off and can quite easily be 
adapted  to transmit  stereo (impossible with AM). A major plus for the  pirate is that its easy to  hide  and 
transport the gear, aerials  are comparatively  small and  can  be  made collapsible. It's  also possible  to  
put  in  a vehicle, even an bicycle and go  mobile, albeit with a smaller  and changing  reception  area. 
The  average 5 to  20  watt  transmitter would  be  in a metal box no  bigger than 12" by 6" by 3" in  size, 
and  weigh no more than 8  lbs with the rest of the gear  (but  not including  the  battery,  if you're using 
one), The aerial  is  not only  shorter but more  efficient and of course more practical than the  long  and 
tricky  procedure for AM aerials. Also low power  FM transmitters    ('rigs')  can  be  tuned  to   slightly   
different frequencies,   on  AM you're stuck on one, unless  you  get  a  new crystal.<P>
   The  disadvantage is that VHF-FM is essentially a 'line of   sight' communication,  which means your 
reception area depends   crucially on the height of your aerial above large blocking  objects. This is no  
problem if you can get up on a hill, or a  tower block  but  it does  restrict the choice of broadcasting  sites, 
making you easier to  find and trap. With local  broadcasting you have more choice of sites.  In  very hilly 
area,  unless you can get up on a  mountain, you'd  better  choose AM,  also if you want to broadcast  
scattered communities  over a wide  area. Distance covered  with  an  FM  rig depends  as  how much  
height as on power. A 40 watt rig  on  a  15 story  tower block  should cover a 15 miles radius if there are  
no blocking objects.  A 4 watt rig should go 5 miles  from  the  same height  but if  you build a directional 
aerial with 'gain' you  can multiply   that  power  many times. You don't  really  need  a  big expensive and 
hard to build transmitter. Also don't assume  a   100 watt  rig  is ten times as powerful as a 10 watt one,  it   
doesn't work like that.<P>
   To  sum  up,  FM  broadcasting is the ideal for the  guerrilla   or community  pirate, cheap, mobile and 
adaptable. another   advantage is  that  there's loads of room on the FM broadcasting  band,  it's literally  
half  empty.  On AM its pretty crowded,  and  at  night you're likely to be blotted out by continental  
interference.<P>
The Broadcasting Site (FM)<P>
TOWER BLOCKS (SKY SCRAPERS)<P>
   In cities tower blocks have been an ideal answer for good  coverage and  wide  reception  and  are 
especially favored  by   commercial pirates (who often use a link transmitter from the  studio  to  the tower  
block so as to go live). A further  advantage is that  there are  usually electric sockets in the  lift or heating 
rooms on  the roof,  so  you can just plug in  provided your gear is so adjusted, rather  than  lug car or 
lorry  batteries about. This is  'Stealing Electricity',  of  course.   If  you're  caught  broadcasting   the 
electricity company could  bring this additional charge, though  in practice  we've  never   heard of it 
happening.  The  advantage  to sticking  in  car   batteries is that  you  can  conceal  your  rig anywhere  
on  the  roof, rather than having it right  by  the  plug socket, though  in a surprise raid your aerial cable 
will lead them straight to it anyway.<P>
   To  get  onto  the roof of a tower block you need  a  crowbar,   or better,  a key. The 'Fireman's keys' 
have to be standard  for   all blocks,  so once you have one you can get onto most roofs easily.<P>
   Try asking  other  pirates, or possibly a friendly  caretaker or fireman.  Or you can break the door, steal 
the mortise  lock,  get keys  made up for it, then replace it, such keys may not fit all roofs.<P>
   When  on  the roof BE CAREFUL (sudden gusts of wind can  blow   you over  the  at  this height!) and 
always wear soft shoes  and   keep quiet.  Lots of people have been busted simply because the  tenants 
below heard them and called the police. Its useful to  dress like a repair  person,  and claim if seen or 
challenged,   to  be  a  lift mechanic.  The main problem with tower blocks is  that, if  raided, you can 
easily be trapped (see how to get away  with it).<P>
MEDIUM SIZED BUILDINGS<P>
   If  you're a local station, or have a high power rig or an   aerial with  gain (or if you're just testing) you 
don't need to  be  on  a tower block. Any building higher than most others will  do, and you can  increase 
your height for instance by mounting  your aerial  on top  of  high, well secured scaffold pole (note:  there 
must  be  a wooden or plastic section between the pole and  the actual aerial).<P>
   The advantage of lower buildings is that you can multiply both  the available sites for broadcasting. You 
will have to switch  sites as often as possible. Also you will have more escape routes  and 'bolt holes' than 
on a tower block. Unfortunately this may  also mean you have  to  watch more potential approach routes 
by  the  police  and DTI, and you'll need more lookouts if you're  planning to save  the gear when 
attacked.<P>
BROADCASTING FROM HILLS<P>
   If  your town or city has hills this is a good option, the   higher the better. You can use a piece of derelict 
or common  land, or  at night  you can use parks, cemeteries or even  allotments. A  better option is if 
there are hills outside the  built up area, then use a field  or wood away from houses. If you  use the 
directional aerial you  can  cover the city just as well.  This was done by  Andromeda Radio, to good 
effect, they used to  cover most of Manchester  from a  high  hill  outside,  using  a  mere  4  watt  
transmitter  with directional  gain aerial. If you  can get up into mountainous  area you're  even better off 
and can  adopt classical guerrilla tactics, often  see  the enemy coming  distances away, and be very 
difficult to stop.<P>
   On  a  hill  within  the  town or city use good  lookouts,   escape routes, CB's etc. and have regular 
'escape drills'. Best  place for aerial  is  a high, easily climbable tree. If its not  too  obvious leave  it  up 
there and have a spare ready. An added  problem  with hills  is  that you normally have to lug at least  one 
car  battery about, which is terrible if you have to climb  fences, ditches etc. at  night, something like a 
pram or shopping  trolley can help. You can't  leave  the  batteries on site as  they need re-charging  for 
your  next broadcast. So mains  electric is a big help if  you  can run  a  lead  from somewhere.  Outdoors 
all your gear  must  be  in waterproof cases, or covered  with a tent or tarp. Tents  are  good if  you can 
pretend to be  camping. Take care also of yourself  and your  group.  Hot   drinks,  food, waterproofs,  
short  shifts  for lookouts  etc.  are good ideas. It gets boring after a  few  hours. CB's  are   excellent, but 
get ones with earphones if  possible  to avoid  noise.<P>
   If  on  a  hill  you can also use ordinary house, flat,  squat   or derelict,  and  just set up your aerial as 
high as practicable   on the  roof.  Its better to get a place, by squatting or  if  you're rich,  by renting, 
specially as a broadcast site, no-one  likes  to live  under constant threat of the police storming in.  In 
practice you  may have to use someone's house, then don't use  it too often. If  you  must  use your own 
house DON'T leave dope,  stolen  goods, false  ID's or other naughties lying about. It is  possible to  run 
your  antenna cable from your house to the  aerial on another roof, and  whip  the cable off quick if they  
come, but this  would  only work once, and you lose output power  with every extra Meter of coax  cable  
going to your aerial. More  of this in the 'How  to  get away  with  it'  section. NEVER have  your studio at 
the  broadcast site. They'll confiscate the lot,  under the new laws.<P>
OTHER POSSIBLE BROADCASTING SITES<P>
   FESTIVALS,  especially large free festivals are an  excellent   and common broadcast site. A small 4 
watt rig will do fine. Set  up  on a  high ground in a tent or vehicle and invite the  festival  attendees to  
protect you from possible police attack, much  more unlikely in these  circumstances. If possible make a 
live  studio  in  a  tent, caravan  or truck and get everyone involved.  Try to get  mentioned in  pre-festival 
publicity, or do your own,  so people  will  bring radios. This is pirate radio at its best.<P>
   DEMOS,  especially long ones, like blockades for e.g.  of   Nuclear Stations or War bases, can be 
equally worthwhile. In this   context the  pirate can be perfect medium for discussion,  information  and 
warnings  of  police movements, as well as for   entertainment  and music.<P>
   BARRICADED SQUATS OR SQUATTED VENUES are another obvious and   much underused  site  
for the guerrilla pirate, especially   during  big meetings or gigs, which you can broadcast live from  the 
roof. This has been done successfully for instance in  Amsterdam and Berlin.<P>
   OCCUPIED FACTORIES or industrial areas during strikes and  disputes provide  an  excellent and 
often missed opportunity for   the  more political  pirate  group, and can provide vital  communication  for 
mobilizing, publishing and gaining support.  There have  been  many such opportunities in Britain over 
recent  years.<P>
   SIT-INS  and  protest  occupations are another  good   possibility, which  we  don't  think has been tried. 
Especially  occupations  of high  towers,  buildings  or pylons for   publicity.  But  in  this situation  
capture is pretty certain,  therefore a small disposable transmitter  would be ideal. A good  strategy is  for  
everyone  to deny  using it, and to use any  following trial for more  publicity e.g.  on  the lines that the  
army etc. and the police are  already hogging most of the  airwaves.<P>
   'NO-GO  AREAS' are a step up from occupied factories. We know   for instance  that nationalist pirates 
broadcast from Free  Derry   and parts  of West Belfast when they were 'no-go areas' to the   state. Of  
course  there are no true 'no-go areas' in Britain,  but  there are  plenty of inner city estates where the 
police  rarely venture, especially  in  the  evenings in the riot   session,  for  fear  of 'concrete rain' or 
worse from the roofs.  A high block on such area could  be  an  excellent site,  especially if you can tip  off  
the local  youth  to lend a hand.  Whenever major rioting begins  large areas  are  suddenly  devoid  of 
police, till  they  can  group  in numbers and re-take the  area. This is another opportunity for  'on the  
ball' local  pirates. By monitoring police radio, runners, and phoned  in  reports such 'uprising radio' could 
be a brilliant  aid<P>
to  the  fighters  on  the  streets though  you  would  need   good security,  disposable transmitter, quick 
getaway routes,  disguised voices etc.<P>
   LIBERATED ZONES! (Let us know if you find one!) Practically   every guerrilla or Nat. Liberation 
movement, be they right or  left wing, has their own pirate radios, which are often crucial  influence in 
such  wars, broadcasting  from  freed  zones  or    neighboring countries. But you're not likely to come 
across this  in Britain.<P>
   INTERNATIONAL WATERS is of course a favorite site, but out of  the question for the small 'do it 
yourself' pirate.<P>
How to set up your gear (FM)<P>
BEFORE YOU GO<P>
Before getting out you had best brief anyone, especially newcomers, on what will or might happen. Talk 
about getting caught,  for  instance have good excuses made up  for being  at  or near  the  site.  If  you are 
planning to give   false  names,  for instance,  you'll need an address where  someone will  confirm  you 
live,  otherwise you might have  troubles getting bail if you  were arrested.  In  this case keep  your first 
names the same  to  avoid being caught out.<P>
   Make  out a standard 'check list' of all you need, and go   through it  before you get out. It's surprisingly 
easy to find  yourself on top of a tower block, or climbing some tree, only to  discover that your cassette 
deck lead is at home five miles away.<P>
         HERE'S A SAMPLE LIST OF THINGS YOU NEED<P>
   Transmitter (TX), TX main lead or 2 clip on battery  leads (large  and well insulated), TX lead to 
cassette deck if not attached, cheap cassette deck plus mains lead or 2 clip ons and 6 volt bike battery, 
charged up 12 volt car battery if not on mains, antenna (check you have butterfly bolts if  collapsible), the 
coaxial cable (with plug attached and clips or  attached to  aerial),  fused  plug  board (if on  mains),   
program  tapes (rewound  to  staring  position), small FM  radio   receiver(s)  to monitor  broadcasts, CB's   
for lookouts, plastic   'gaffer  tape', soldering iron and solder in ease of broken  leads, torch, warm clothes, 
munches, bus fare.<P>
ON THE WAY<P>
   Ideally  you  need four people, at least two. Carry  the  gear as inconspicuously  as  possible, in hold alls 
or  plastic  bags. The antenna  is  a problem. If it's a big long one make it  collapsible using  butterfly  nuts 
in assembly. Or try to  keep   it somewhere close  to  the site. On arrival at the site,  especially if you've 
used  it before, send an empty-handed scout  ahead, to be sure  the police and DTI aren't waiting for you 
and  all is clear. Check also you're not followed.<P>
SETTING UP<P>
   In the case of a tower block you should have been there  beforehand and  have  either a key or a broken 
lock to get  straight onto  the roof. Lock the door quietly behind you. If  there's two doors  onto the  roof  
have access through both. Take  your gear to  a  lift/heating  room and find a plug in wall  socket (if on 
mains).  Check it  works.  Wear gloves when  handling gear, and clean it regularly with cloth and alcohol.  
They don't usually bother with fingerprint evidence,  but  they   might start. The  antenna  must  be  
cleaned regularly  anyway  for good transmissions. Set up your  antenna  as high  as   possible,  if possible 
on top of an  extension  pole  or length  of  scaffold pipe. Often there's a pole already,  left   by earlier 
pirates. Attach the antenna securely, with bolts or  strong gaffer  tape, to a length of wood, then the 
bottom of the  wood  to the  metal  pole (if there). The antenna must NOT be   touching or blocked  by 
metal. The coax cable can be soldered or  bolted  onto the antenna, or attached with strong, rust free car  
battery clips.<P>
   The clips are recommended for fast dismantling and for testing  and developing  antennas,  mark clearly 
which goes  where.  The   coax cable  should  not be longer than absolutely necessary,  you   lose power  
with every extra foot, and should be good quality and   well insulated.  Your  lookouts  should already  be  
on  station,   with torches  or CB's, one at the foot of the tower (preferably  sitting on a car or flat) and one 
on the roof. Keep low and quiet  and wear soft  shoes.  (In one court case Eric Gotts (head of   DTI  
squads) claimed  he  recognized an Our Radio member from   the  ground,  18 stories up, at night. The 
judge accepted his  word.)<P>
   When  the antenna is up securely, lead the coax back and plug   or screw in to the back of your 
transmitter . Now plug the TX to   the cassette  deck  keeping  the  two as far  as  possible   apart,  if 
possible  blocked  by  something solid,  like  a   wall,  to  avoid interference. Keep the audio lead well 
away from  the power  leads.<P>
   Interference between leads can often cause loss of power and/or 'Sprogs' (unwanted signals on the wrong 
frequency). You can go   so far as to block leads from each other with bricks.<P>
   Plug  in  the  cassette deck and the TX to  your  plug  board   (or connect  to  batteries) and switch on. If 
you have  that   facility just  switch on the exciter stage of the TX first for  testing,  no need to alert Big 
Brother prematurely. Go on the  other end of  the roof  with  your  radio  receiver and tune  in.   Then  
adjust  the modulation on your TX, in relation of other  channels, to  get  the best  sound.  If  this  is  OK  
but  there's  unusual  knocking  or crackling sounds try moving the  cassette deck further from the TX, or  
raise  it above ground if  possible. Try further separating  or screening the power lines  from the audio 
lines.<P>
   You  may  well  find that you have sprogs (harmonics  or   spurious signals)  all  over  the band. Check 
for  this.  If  so   check reception  with your lookout 100 yards away, normally such   sprogs disappear  by 
that distance and you're OK. But if your   signal  is still spread all over further away switch off and  clear 
off.  Your TX  is messed up and needs difficult repair or  tuning you can't do on  the  site. If you find 
you're interfering  with fire, ambulance or  pigs, stop, before they come after you.  Most pirates are  very 
careful not to do this.<P>
   When  all  checks are OK, insert your program tape, switch   off, and  wait  for  the  agreed time to 
begin. With practice you   can easily  set it all up and test it in 10 minutes, but it's  good  to allow  a  half  
hour  and to be methodical and  cool.   Never,  for instance,  switch on your TX without the antenna  
attached,  you'll blow  it.  The  amp  stage of your TX should  get  quite  hot  when drawing  the  power,  
if  not  its  not   working.  With   bigger transmitters you may need also a small  electric fan  to  cool  the 
heatsinks on the power transistors.  Once you're on air its good to go and phone friends for reception  
reports further afield.<P>
Broadcasting.... How to get away with it<P>
KNOW YOUR ENEMY<P>
   On  a  tower block, in London, the DTI squads can tell  where   you are,  within 20 meters, less than 10 
minutes after you switch   on.<P>
   So  they  can  bust you any time. In the case of new  pirates   the procedure  is  to  monitor you for a 
while (in  case  you're   just messing about) before busting you. It could easily be a few  months before  
your  first  attempted bust.  If  you  play   anything  but straight  music they will record and keep all your  
programs  for possible further use against you (though voice  print's aren't used in  court). In other cities 
they are  generally slower to get after you. In smaller towns they don't  have permanent staff so they have 
to  come specially, depending  on your usual broadcasting time, so switching your time is a big  
advantage.<P>
   The  detection squads are now directed by the Home Office   through the  Department  of  Trade and 
Industry (DTI) and  are   officially responsible  for stamping out 'radio interference'.  They  have  recently  
been  recognized and upgraded with  fancy   new  equipment. Their  HQ  is at Waterloo House by 
Waterloo  Bridge and  they  have several  other fixed triangulation  stations in London, for instant 
tracking. They use also mobile  detection vans and lots of unmarked cars  and  have a depot in  East 
London for vehicles and  gear.  We don't  know  where  they   keep their  extensive  horde  of  stolen 
transmitters  prior to  disposal. They also have  their  own  radio frequencies,  they  used to be (and still 
may be) using  around  88 MHz, just off the  commercial FM band.<P>
   The  DTI  squads are not supposed to arrest you, so they  have   to bring  the  local  filth along on busts, 
which makes  them  a   lot easier to spot and makes them less flexible, as they often  have to wait till the 
cops have the time free. For  large  rich  commercial pirates the game is to have plenty  of transmitters  
lined up, and not to try to save them if  the  police and DTI  raid. They often use remote links and can 
often switch  on and  off using timers or radio signals, so they don't have  to   go back  and change tapes 
and no one need get caught in the act   (but recently  the DTI have cracked this by raiding the 'live   
studios' and nicking everyone and everything).<P>
   But  for small community / political pirates with only one or   two transmitters its essential to save the 
gear if at all  possible. At the same time its now always cheaper to lose all the  gear than  to get  caught 
and pay the fines. Nowadays even for  the small  pirate it may be more advisable to put energy into  money 
raising and mass producing  cheap transmitters than into  trying to  save  the  gear when  they're  hot on 
your trail  (though you need to guard  anyway against the curious and  rip-offs by other pirates.)<P>
PRECAUTIONS<P>
   Don't  talk  and boast unnecessarily about your sites  or   studio. Work  on a 'need to know' basis from 
the start. One  method  is  to keep  program makers separate from your  broadcasting team, tapes can even 
be delivered to a 'dead letter  drop' for instance. But if you  can  really trust each other its  better if 
everyone  takes  a turn  at  broadcasting, otherwise  the broadcasters  can  both  get pissed  off  and 
become a power  elite ('I'm not transmitting  this crap!').<P>
   Don't,   of  course,  broadcast  your  location,  real  names    or addresses.  Don't  give  your phone 
number  either,  certainly   in Britain,  the days of phone-ins and instant access to pirates   are numbered. 
If you're really into phone-ins, get a phone in a   false name  at  a temporary address or squatted flat (NOT 
your   studio).<P>
   Tape  the  calls and check you're not followed there. For   letters use  a box address (e.g. Wuppertal in 
Germany) and assume  all mail is  read,  or use a forwarding address. When travelling   to  sites vary your 
means of transport.<P>
The raid..... Saving the gear<P>
A.) HIDING IT ON THE SITE<P>
   Some  pirates  have  tried  building the transmitter  into   walls, parapets, roof, chimney stacks etc. You 
can conceal it  under water tanks,  central heating or lift machinery. Better  still  have  it hidden in a legal 
or squatted top floor flat  (possibly 2nd to  top would  do) concealing your coax cable  either up the side  of  
the building,  by  boring  a hole in the  roof, or  by  running  it  up ventilation  or 'stink' pipes.  Another 
variation is to  have  your tape  player in a flat, and a  long concealed audio lead to the  TX on  the  roof. 
The  possibilities are endless, and most  have  been tried.  On  one   occasion Our Radio tried the 'dummy  
transmitter' trick,  with  it's own dummy aerial, leading the hounds to one  end of  the   roof,  while  they  
left  by  another  door.  Inside  the transmitter box was a can of beer and a 'Booby Prize' note. In  all these  
cases  you still need to at least remove your  coax   cable before  the  cop arrive, or of course it'll lead   
straight  to your TX.<P>
B.) LOOKOUTS<P>
   You  need  two,  preferably three, and take it in  turns,  and   if possible also monitor police and DTI 
radio channels. You  can   use torches or signals from ground to roof. If on CB's turn them very low or use 
headphones, and use codewords, they're very  public.<P>
   Watch out for cars and vans with too many aerials, electrical  gear in   the  passenger  seat,  hanging  
around  trying  not  to   look suspicious, police cars passing several times etc. Keep an  eye  on nearby  
tower  blocks or anywhere they may observe the   roof  with field  glasses. A raid is usually obvious, two 
or  three cars  with uniformed police accompanying them (though  piggies may be also  in an  unmarked 
car). They usually try and  rush in a side or  a  back entrance, so watch out... it's quite  embarrassing to 
have all your friends  nicked, and you still  standing out front yawning! Usually they take the lift 
(sometimes  using a 'fireman's key' to bring  it down fast) and often send a  few young ones up the 
stairs.<P>
C.) CAT AND MOUSE<P>
   This  involves  moving  and  hiding  the  gear,  in  flats,   stair cupboards, lift  shafts, hanging  out  
windows,   disguised as something else, etc. Normally they have no case if  they can't find it,  but  under  
the new laws they might try to  do you  anyway  if you're  caught. If your lookout system works  you have 
at least 2 minutes warning before they reach the top  of the tower block. You can delay them by switching 
off the  power in the lift room, but if doing  this be quite certain  you're not trapping anyone, which  is 
difficult. You can call the  lift immediately, and if you get  them first   jam  the  doors   open.  You  should  
practice  for   quick dismantling  and   packing  of the gear in  advice.  Sometimes  its easier to leave  the 
antenna and build a new one. A  good  simple 'Cat and Mouse'  is to run down several flights  of stairs  
with  the gear, hide  it in a good spot (the ideal  is  the flat  of a 'neutral'  friend) and turn into a 'normal' 
citizen.  If you're stopped have  a good excuse for being there. Cat  and  Mouse is a good system  to start 
off with.  But  remember they  have  done  it  1000s  of  times  before.  When  they  become determined to 
bust you you'll  need more and more determined people and  new  broadcasting sites  to stay ahead. After a 
certain  point they're  sure  to  catch  you, as they learn more about  you,  your faces, your habits,  your 
tricks, and as they put more and more men on  the  case.  If  you want to get away with it  its  time  for  a 
complete change  of tactics.<P>
D.) DISAPPEARING<P>
   When  the DTI are really on your tail one thing you can do is  take a  weeks  rest,  then come back with 
a different name,   style  and timing.  Of course this messes up your efforts to make  a  name  for 
yourselves and gain a regular audience, but at least  you're still on  air, with maybe a few months grace 
before they  start after you again. Also change your frequency and voices on  tape if possible.<P>
E.) SWITCHING<P>
   In theory this is a good system, but you need a big team, your  own transport,  and  two  or three 
transmitters  (on  the  exact   same wavelength). The idea is this... as the police and DTI close  in on one  
location, the signal switches to a second site. Either  you're using  links, or have copies of the program 
tapes. The   team  at the  first site evades the police and sets off a 3rd  site and sets up.  If  they go for the 
2nd site you switch to the  3rd  site  and carry on etc. When combined to Cat and Mouse  tactics this can 
make you  difficult  to stop. The problems are,  if you're  using  tower blocks your choices are limited... If 
you  set up say 5 miles  away your  reception area may be completely  different, and you'll  need plenty of 
dedicated people ready to  wait night after night to play games with the police... And when  they become 
determined they will still  get  you.  We  know of  one South London  pirate,  who  used switching  with 
apparent  success, then one night all  3  of  their transmitters were  seized within 15 minutes! Switching  
would work better when  combined and varied  with  other methods  of getting away with  it. Particularly 
if you're  doing  a local station, where you  don't need so much height, and have  lots of more choice of  
broadcasting sites.<P>
F.) GUERRILLA RADIO<P>
   This  is  one  of the main ideas this text is trying  to   promote. Guerrilla, or Hit and Run radio is the 
war of the flea.   First  of all  you  can  reduce the risks of getting caught   drastically  by broadcasting  not 
a fixed times or a fixed name,  or  by  doing  it only  for  1/2  hour periods. The problem of  course is  that  
your audience  is also random and small. The  guerrilla idea is  to  get together  quite a few stations,  
broadcasting on the same frequency with cheap, mass produced  transmitters, thus forming one big loose 
station  which   listeners would have a good chance of  finding  on air, while  being very difficult for the 
DTI and police to stop.<P>
BREAK-INS<P>
   Break-ins  are  a higher and riskier form of guerrilla  radio,   as used in Britain by Radio Arthur and 
Radio Wapping. The idea is   to grab your audience by broadcasting on top of a legal station.   The 
sentences  are  much higher but there's little chance  of   getting caught  if your break-ins short, say for 
five minutes, on   top of the  news  or  advertising  of  a  major  station.  You're   taking advantage of a 
quality of FM broadcasting that the  stronger signal tends  to  'win', blotting out the weaker one  
completely.  With  a small transmitter you'll only win for a  short distance, but even a few  hundred  yards 
could cover a  whole high density  estate.  For break-ins  strength of signal is  the main factor, a  big  
powerful transmitter (100-200 watts) tuned exactly to the  required frequency so you can  break in for your 
message on the most popular channel  on  prime  time. For break-ins all precautions  should  be doubled, 
also be  sure to clear right away from the area as soon as you've  finished, and don't use the same time or 
broadcasting site again. It's as simple as that.<P>
   Break-ins are also easily possible on TV, but only over the  sound. Break-ins  are  more common in 
countries where pirates  have   been repressed, e.g. in Germany or the Eastern Block, and are  ideal for 
announcing, demonstrations etc.<P>
   There  is  another and better way of doing break-ins on FM,   which may  have  been  used by Radio 
Arthur. This is  to  use   the  UHF microwave  transmitter, beaming your signal at the  microwave  dish 
receiving the signals of a legal station from  their studios. Their dish  then picks up your signal, and  
providing you're close enough to  be  stronger than their signal,  you get re-broadcast by  their main  
transmitter,  thus  giving  your break-ins  perfect  coverage throughout their reception  area. However,  we 
don't have technical plans to build such  tricky  UHF transmitters, and it would be quite expensive. 
Though  this type of break-ins is possibly at present. (To stop you fast  they'd have to switch  off the entire 
station.) They will  probably make  it  more difficult by using access codes to  receiver dishes, as its 
already done  to avoid piracy of  satellite dishes. NOTE: Don't play around with microwaves, they  can be 
dangerous!<P>
GOING MOBILE<P>
   In  theory this is an ideal way of getting away with it, but  there are quite a few problems. If you're going 
in a vehicle you  can use ordinary  car  cassette player, but you are better  off   having  a separate 12 volt 
car battery to power the transmitter.    <P>
   One problem is  with  the aerial. If you use a bigger, more  efficient  one  it will  be  very  obvious, one 
possibility is to   have  it  under  a tarpaulin  on a roof rack. A bigger problem is  height, unless  you can  
park or drive up and down on a high  hill, your coverage  will be badly blocked. And then of course  your 
reception area will vary radically if you're driving any  distance. Not much use for gaining or  developing 
an audience.  The main advantage is that you will be much more difficult to  stop.<P>
   Going  mobile is more practical as a publicity stunt, or   possibly for  local broadcasts. To a small extent, 
having a  bigger TX  will compensate  for  lack  of  height.  Going  mobile   is   good   for broadcasting at 
random just for the hell with it.<P>
   Doing  break-ins in this way would be great fun in the  rush   hour traffic.<P>
LINKS, TIMERS, SQUARE WAVES<P>
   These aren't for the shoestring pirate, though you can build   them cheap  if  you have the know-how. As 
we said earlier  links   often prevent you being busted personally, if you can afford to  lose the gear,  and  
allow you to do live programs. All  it   involves  is using a receiver instead of a cassette deck, then  
beaming up  your signal   from  your  studio,  or  whatever,   using  a  small   UHF transmitter (e.g. on 
370 MHz) or adapted  cordless telephone, or an FM  exciter  on  a different frequency  (or even an 
ordinary  phone line, though sound quality suffers).  You also have to make a small directional  high gain 
antenna. If  you're using a low  power  link and  a narrow beam its highly  impossible for the DTI to trace 
you, and  it  was  assumed  to be  safe to link  from  the  studio.  But recently  studios using  links have 
been raided, in  a  few  cases, with  every  bit of  equipment, furniture, record collections  etc. seized under 
the  1984 laws (e.g. a raid on Radio Horizon's studios in late 1895  when over £20000 worth of gear was 
'stolen' legally).<P>
   This  may  not  however mean that the DTI's new  gear  can   detect links.  It's  just as easy to find your 
location by  gossip,  phone taps or just by following you. Links can make you  personally safe, if  they can 
trace you one you could always use  two, or three,  or .... what they don't and can't do is protect  your 
transmitter, its main  advantage is that it allows you to go  live from the  studio.<P>
   To  protect  yourself you might as well use a timer to switch   the gear on and off remotely. Timers are 
pretty easy to build,  and you can  buy  kits, but good ones are hard to find 'off the  shelf'  as they can 
obviously be used to make bombs. A good one  to buy is the plug  in  variety,  used  for  fooling  burglars   
when  you're  on holidays, or by landlords to deter squatters.  For remote switching you  can also make 
sound activated switches,  via a radio link,  or 'square  wave'   switches, via a phone  line. What  none  of  
these devices can do however is to turn  over the tape, so you still have to  go  to  the site to do this,  unless 
you want to broadcast  for less than an hour.<P>
CONFRONTATION<P>
   A good trick if you can get away with it. The DTI and police  (they normally  only  bring a few) are 
wide open to  attack  (the   mouse becomes  the cat!) when coming to get you. The problem is  that  in 
future  you'll  have to change your station name,  frequency,  even your  radio  voice and they'll always be 
on your  trail.  The  good thing  is that if pirates start attacking them  they have to  bring many  more 
police with them, and can only do  it when spare  police are  available. Also they are always  looking over 
their shoulders, and have to be more careful with  their surveillance work. One  way  to  hit back, on tower 
blocks,  is to trap  them  in  the lifts.  The lookouts signals up when  they're in and you throw  the main  
power  switches in the lift  room. Be careful you don't  trap residents  as  well.  Then you  take your  gear  
down  the  stairs, beating  up  any of them you  meet on the way, and make off.  Their cars  are also 
vulnerable,  usually they're parked unguarded around the  corner.  If  you're  going to attack them directly  
make  sure you're well masked and  tooled up and have enough skill and numbers to  get past them. Go  
straight for the police officers and disable them  before they  can make their 'officer in distress' call  (take 
or smash their  radios, or have someone jamming their frequencies). Other  direct  ways of hitting back 
are attacking the DTI at  their bases,   attacking  their  vehicles at the  depot,  obtaining  home addresses  /  
phone numbers of chief officers and  harassing  them etc.<P>
   Remember they have the entire state apparatus backing them up, any form of direct attack should 
therefore be anonymous  and never spoken of or boasted about later (or before!).<P>
   When  the lookout signals a raid or anything very suspicious  (e.g. a cop car cruising too close too often) 
immediately  switch  off, dismantle the gear and move it (switch off the TX  first, then  the tape deck.  
DON'T rip out the aerial when the TX is still switched on!)<P>
Building your pirate station<P>
   We're not talking here about commercial pirates, where its  just  a matter  of  having good financial 
backing, popular  DJ's   and  hit records,  plenty  of  ads, jingles and news  replayed   from  legal 
stations.<P>
   We're  talking about the 'do-it-yourself' community  or   political pirate,  starting from square one, and 
doing something   worthwhile and  original. The truth is that most commercial  pirates, in their effort  to  
offend  nobody and build towards a   possible  license, practice  heavy  censorship  and  are  often   as  
boring,   banal, repetitive,  capitalist, sexist, elitist and  even  anti-democratic as  the  legal ones, though 
there are few  exceptions. Such pirates are  obsessed  with keeping their  technology secret and attacking 
the competition at every  opportunity.<P>
   Smaller,  non-commercial pirates are in a different situation   and can  only  survive and develop by 
cooperation, with the   eventual aim  of  breaking  the  state  and  commercial  monopoly   of  'Her 
Majesty's' airwaves.<P>
<P>
YOURSELF<P>
   First  thing you need is an interest in sound, and something  worth saying  or playing. Get a hold of a 
mike and a cassette   deck  and play  around  with it. Record yourself, record any and  everything.<P>
   Listen and record off the radio, off TV, off people's stereos,   in the  street. Play back your results, see 
where you went wrong,  and try  again. Note down your results and ideas and discuss them  with others. 
Read everything you can find about sound and  recording and think  about why you want to be a radio 
pirate.  Join the Free The Airwaves campaign and read their 'Radio Crimes'  bulletins.<P>
THE GROUP<P>
   You  need  to  find more people with similar ideas, and  not   just 'hangers  on'. You need to get to know 
each other well,   find  out who  you  can trust, and ditch those you can't. Members  should  be prepared  
to  share  in  the  tasks, risks  and   finances  equally according  to  their abilities (in practice  this rarely  
happens).<P>
   Hold  regular meetings, just keeping in touch can be a problem   in big  cities.  Go for maximum 
openness so everyone  knows  what   is going on. Beware of the power freaks, ego trippers, party  builders 
etc. who are sure to turn up sooner or later.<P>
   A good point to start is with fund raising, arranging gigs,  jumble sales,  meetings, sponsored events or 
whatever, which  can   cement your  group, attract more people, and advertise your  station.  How you  do  
it depends a lot on the type of project  you're doing.  If for  example  you're  planning a minority   
language  station  (and there's  millions  in  Britain who have  no radio  in  their  first language)   you'll  
want  to   advertise  widely   through   ethnic organizations. If you're a  'revolutionary' group planning to 
claim responsibility  for armed  actions you won't want to  advertise  at all.  Minority music  stations are 
the most common. But we'd advice you to widen and  deepen your group, or join with others, if you're 
going  to build  and maintain the commitment (and cash) to  keep  a station going.  Many music stations 
get backing from clubs, and are the  platform  for the disgustingly egotistical and inane DJ's  who work in  
those clubs. Such solid backing is a good idea however. If you're running a station, you'll be hard pushed 
to fund a raise  as well.  If you see your station as a part of a wider movement  (e.g. anti-war,  women, 
gay, anarchist, animal rights etc.)  you   should try  to get regular backing from that movement. Another  
good trick is  to  siphon  off small amounts of cash regularly  from  council, charity  or  student union 
funded bodies which   your  members  are involved in. What you need is income, not a  lot, even £20  a  
week would  do if regular. If some of your  members have good jobs  they might  be  able to do it, 
otherwise  you could be tied  in  with  a money  making co-op or small  business. One example of this is  
the squatters pirates in  Amsterdam, who can get a small regular income from  a  fund  raised by a small 
tax on drink in squatted pubs  and cafes.<P>
OPEN ACCESS<P>
   Once  your  group is going well, and you've started to make   tapes and  get  the  gear and cash together, 
you should think   seriously about teaming up with other groups who you broadly  agree with  (or don't  
disagree). For example at the moment (late  1986) there  are dozens  of  such  groups who have failed to  
get   Community  Radio licenses and are dying to get their stuff on  air, though afraid to 'go pirate' in their 
present hostile  climate.<P>
   The  idea  of  'Open Access' is to share a frequency, studios   and even  transmitting gear to start with, 
with different groups.   The advantages are obvious... more money coming in from more   sources, less  
equipment  needed  to begin with,  a  pooling  of   technical abilities,  more  political  clout,  more   
participation,   bigger audiences  etc.  A  good way to approach  this idea  is  by  having public meetings, 
contact Free The  Airwaves campaign etc.<P>
   The  problems come with coordination, political rivalry,  possible infiltration and the sharing of tasks. 
For an Open  Access grouping you  need  regular democratic meetings of all  involved  (at  least monthly) 
and insist on full attendance. You  need a few good people who are into organizing it and making it  
work. Another problem  is with  broadcasting. You should aim for  everyone having  their  own gear  and 
broadcast team as soon as  you can, so you will  be  more difficult  to stop by the police  and DTI. So you 
should insist  on every  group producing tapes  providing at least two trusted people regularly  both to the  
broadcast team and to work on the technical and backup side of it  (building, repairing, purchasing 
etc.).<P>
   Open  Access station depend on cooperation, if you have that  then all  the other advantages come into 
play, but you are  fighting all the  time against our training, in this society, to  be competitive and  
individualist.  The  ideas of Open  Access   radio  have  been pioneered in this country by stations like  
Sheffield Peace  Radio, Our  Radio  and  Cambridge Community  Radio and its worth  studying their  
experience quite closely, as  well as the  example  of  such stations and Federations of  pirates in other 
countries. Its  often fatal  to  allow one  person, however benevolent they may seem,  to become  a leader 
or  spokesperson for an Open Access grouping.  The straight media  also love this to happen.<P>
LOCAL / "COMMUNITY" PIRATE RADIO<P>
   The word 'community' has lost any real meaning, through misuse  and over-use  (e.g.  'Community 
Policing'). The old style   communities are  thing of the past (if they ever really existed)  except on the 
Soap  Operas,  as  the system breaks us all down   into  individual consumers. So if you're talking about 
'Community  Radio' you should be  quite  clear what you mean by it, and what  the State means  by 
proposing (and then cancelling) such an  ideas. What class, ethnic, interest,  political  or gender  sections 
of  the  people  are  you aiming your pirate radio at?  Or better, creating your pirate radio with?  Or are 
you really  working on your own career? Or trying  to create 'community' in  your own head?....<P>
   Local pirate radio is a more clear idea. There are many  advantages to  broadcasting locally, e.g. more 
broadcasting  sites, harder  to get  caught, room for more pirates on the  broadcast band,  cheaper and 
easier to built transmitters, closer  contact and participation of  listeners etc. In a big city it's a  good idea 
for your station to  base  yourselves  in  one  area,  whether  you're  broadcasting locally  or  city-wide. 
You need a  local base, and local  backing, financial  if possible. If your  station is appealing to one  small 
section  of listeners it may  not however make sense to do a  local station,  because  the   potential listeners  
are  fewer.  A  local station should aim at  a fairly wide section of the population.  An Open  Access   
station  would work well on a local  basis,  as  coordination  would be easier, and all kinds of interest and 
minority groups   could  be persuaded to make programs. On a  local  basis  publicity  and  support  are  
much  easier  to  get,  as  is    the possibility of mobilizing people to defend you when attacked,  e.g. a 
popular station in the middle of the large housing estate.  Local broadcasting in inner city areas can 
nevertheless involve  hundreds of  thousands of potential listeners. Most of the  smaller existing pirates 
are, in effect, local stations, because  of the limitations of  height  and the power of their  transmitters, 
though  very  few allow any access or see  themselves as a local voice and resource.<P>
How to make a studio<P>
   Back   to  square  one,  you've  fooled  around  with  tapes    and microphones, but soon you're going to 
want your own studio.  If you have  no  cash don't let that stop you! Most of the  gear   can  be borrowed  
to start off with. For beginners purpose a  studio  is  a small  room,  a  couple  of  turntables  and   cassette  
decks,   a microphone,  headphones, and a small disco  mixer,  a  plug  board, leads, some records and a 
table to put it  all on. You'll also need some  blank cassette tapes, and sound  effects records if  you  can 
(borrow from a record library).<P>
   After that it's just practice and patience, knowing and  collecting your  material, and getting more or 
better sound gear   as  you  go along.<P>
   Having  said  that  there's plenty of tips  we  can  give   you.  A permanent  room  is handy. Sound proof 
it if you  can,   cardboard, layers of carpet, egg boxes or Styrofoam are all good.  Try to plan it  out before 
you start as to have everything within  reach of the operator(s), while having enough room for the  
interviews and group work.  If you build your own control desk  you can drill holes  and arrange  for all 
the leads to disappear  and join underneath,  much less  hassle. If you're buying  cassette decks try to get 
something also  suitable  for outdoor  work. Try it out before  buying,  e.g. don't  get one which  leaves a 
loud click on the recording whenever you  lift the pause  button. Quality and editing are better if  you 
record  your   final product from mixer onto a reel  to  reel  tape recorder,    though  it  means  re-
recording  onto  cassettes   for  broadcasting,  and  a good cassette deck can  give  near  as   good results  
and is cheaper. If buying a microphone it's worth  getting a good directional one suitable for studio and 
outdoor  interviews, and  make  sure  the 'impedance' suits your mixer. A   'cheap'  £50 disco  mixer will 
do the job (you can even mix  through some stereo units). If you have the cash go for the  flashy new £150 
range with built  in graphic equalizer with which  you can do wonders. Another tip, keep mike leads, din 
leads and  power leads well separate each other  and make sure everything is  well grounded (from the  
chassis if necessary). If you also have  'hum' problems with cassette decks try plugging in the power lead  
the other way round (i.e. where  it goes  into  deck). Use cheap  turntables, not automatics,  and  buy ones  
which  use cheap  cartridges, as you'll have to replace  them often anyway. Use  good quality cassette tapes 
however. C120's  are best for length  of program, but get the best or they'll tear  or jam. On the  turntables 
put in your own on-off 'cue' switches,  for ease  of  operation. When you've 'cued' a record to where you  
want to   start, turn it a full turn back, by hand, to avoid slow  start up   noise. Try and have an LED meter 
on the mixer and on the final  tape  recorder, allow the needle to go just into the red for  music recording, 
but only half way up for speech recording. For  group interviews  an  omnidirectional mike can be handy, 
and pay   special attention  to  sound recording levels and background  noise. <P>
   Don't use  telephone in the studio. Though the phone is the  lifeline  of democratic radio, in the present 
climate it means  you'll be busted and/or have everything in the room recorded by  the police.... You  
really  do  need  two turntables, and at  least  two  cassette decks... All these tips, and more you'll  pick up 
as you go  along, but  it's  good to work out standard  'how to use the  studio'  for newcomers.  Pay  
attention  to  safety,  e.g.  have  the  plugboard (fused)  well out of the way,  and don't allow coffee or beer  
near the gear. Read a book on  basic sound studios.<P>
   One  last tip, lock it up well, especially if it's not in your  own home,  and barricade and cover any 
windows. there's one sure  thing about  accumulating sound gear... sooner or later  someone will  nick 
it!<P>
The program<P>
   This   is  entirely  up  to  yourself.  No  need  to  follow    any conventions.   Some  people  say  have  to  
'master'   conventional programming  before you can do something different.  Other  say  if you do that 
you'll never do anything different.<P>
   Again  there are some hard learned tips for pirate. It's  good  to talk  with all concerned before starting, 
make a list of  all   the possible material gathered (music, interviews, sound effects,  news items,  jokes  or 
whatever) and try to put it into  some   kind  of order. A signature tune or jingle isn't such a bad idea,  as 
people recognize  the program by it, often after they've  forgotten  the name.  Repeat the name of your 
program often, but  not too often, along  with your frequency and broadcast time.     <P>
   Put your  important items  first  (e.g.  a demo next day, your  appeal  etc.)  as  it's always  possible you 
may be busted before  the program  ends.  If you're excepting a bust put all your best  material first and  
keep the  Word is invalid, but it is short.  Use first names (false ones) and try to have a  friendly, relaxed  
atmosphere and give everyone present a go  on the  microphone   and control desk. While throwing out  
conventions don't forget  that we're all conditioned to quick variety and short attention   spans. Long 
single person interviews  are  not  on,  no matter  how interesting, but need breaking up, also remember 
people are   continually tuning in (and out) and if doing long pieces  you  need  to  'flash  back'  the story 
so far. You  need  variety   and interaction without sticking in jingles every 30 seconds. Try   and make  it  
interesting / enjoyable / entertaining both for you   and the audience, otherwise why to bother?...<P>
   Style  and themes are your department. It's easy on radio  to   get arrogantly carried away with an idea of 
your own ego, or with  'in' jokes or political hobby horse, watch out for this.    <P>
   Practice with using the gear, good preparation and research make  everything  go much smoothly. 
Background music and fading music in and out can be very  effective if done well. A large studio, tea 
breaks etc. help a  lot.  The more time you put in the better the result (usually), you can spend a whole 
night making a good one hour current affairs program, for instance.<P>
   More than that is hard to say, so much depends on the people,   the subject, the projected audience, the 
time of broadcast  etc.   You should  actively go out and seek feedback and opinions from  people you  
know  have listened. Probably you won't bee able to  do  phone ins  and mail is slow and erratic (don't 
worry if you  don't get  a big  mailbag, few stations or programs really do).  It's easy  to become cut off and 
feel like you're talking into a  vacuum, or  get completely wrong idea of what kind of people are  
listening.<P>
   Making  programs  is  really  not  that  hard,  however  bad   an inexperienced you are, you can quite 
easily improve on some of  the 'aural shit' being pumped out by legal stations over the  airwaves, 24 hours 
per day!<P>
Publicity<P>
   Publicity  is very important, especially when you're starting   off your  new station. Of course your main 
publicity is to keep  coming back  on  air, no matter what. But if you're hoping for a  minority audience  to 
tune in specially you need to advertise a   lot  where those  people are likely to see or read it. Be warned,  
there's  no real  tradition  in  this  country for  large  scale   support  for pirates,  and people often tend to 
consume the media   i.e.  forget instantly they switch off. It could take you long  time to build up the  
regular, participate audience, and the  solid support you need to attract new blood, break even  financially 
etc.<P>
   If  you're  a  local  station your publicity is  obviously  a   lot easier, and you can poster, graffiti, or even 
leaflet your   entire reception area. If you're a wider station make sure you're   always mentioned in the 
'what's on' papers and get articles or  interviews into  any  paper  likely to support you. Send  out   regular  
press releases  to  the local and national press, and  try  to  cultivate contacts  among  the  slimy  reptiles   
(journalists).  Almost  any publicity is good, as those people  likely to listen in to you will also  likely read 
behind the bias  of Tory press. Oddly, one  place you  should certainly seek  publicity is on radio, try for 
instance getting onto phone ins.  On radio you are already talking to people who listen to it! TV,  if you 
can find any way to stunt to get onto it,  is the most  powerful publicity and you should certainly court the  
bastards   running the local TV news, this kind of  appearance really  does   stick  in people's minds and 
start  them  talking...<P>
   Strangely  enough  the media are not overly  hostile  to   pirates, providing  you're just an oddity, not a 
direct threat.  Many  media workers  hate  the shit they're forced to produce and   admire  the 'romantic'  
pirates. You should play on this for all   it's  worth, and  always try and get your frequency and broadcast  
times across. They  will sometimes put you on, as an interesting  item.  Remember that pirate radio is a 
'victimless crime'! If  you're mainly a music station you should publicize where people listen  to  that  type 
of music, if you have  your  own  club,   of course,  you're laughing. Join Free The Airwaves and get  
publicity in  their  paper. Write articles for radio pages, and   do  benefit gigs,  public  meetings, media 
stunts, whatever  you   can  manage.<P>
   Choose  a  catchy, hard hitting name for your station.  If   you're doing  political stuff they're going to go 
for you anyway,  so  you might as well get value for effort!<P>
   Remember,  if you want to be a participatory station, you'll   have to  go  out  and  seek  feedback. Get 
out on  the  street   and  do interviews whatever you can. Take along your cassette  recorder  to every  type  
of  event, the more different voices   and  views  the better.<P>
Building up your pirate station<P>
   It's  hard  to  give  advice about longer  term  development,   but there's a few things worth saying. First 
of all it's  important  to pace  yourselves. It's easy to start off with a lot  of enthusiasm, then  get busted off 
the air, or just burnt out  with too much work or  too few people. However good or different  you are you 
will  be very  lucky  to  build  up  a  regular  audience  or  mass  support overnight. Though your potential  
number of listeners may  be  huge you  can  except  response  to   be  slow.  Breaking  down  passive 
consumption  of  the  media is  not easy. Having  your  own  clubs, events, regular demos etc.  helps, as do 
dramatic publicity stunts.<P>
   You  need  to work out what you're aiming at. We say support,   participation and a large number of 
listeners is a good aim. But   you may  just  be  broadcasting as a way of pressuring for  a   license (which 
is a bit of a sell-out and a pipedream). Ideally  you should plan  ahead and gradually increase your 
broadcasting  times,  while developing all aspects of your station, rather than  going all  out and then 
collapsing at the first bust. The best  advice then is  to operate  well within your capabilities, and to  join  
up  with  any other  pirates  who are not commercial and  not racist,  sexist  or fascist. Your longer term 
aim, as a  pirate, should be to  reach  a situation  where  you  have  so  much support  (money,  volunteers, 
transmitters,  listener  support etc.) that the state  just  cannot wipe  you  out at  will. The best hope for 
pirates is to swamp  the forces  of   repression by sheer numbers, as happened, at different times,  in   
Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and  now,  it seems,  in   Spain.  This does not imply chaos,  but  
cooperation, federations  and sharing of the available airwaves and  times.  The swamping   the airwaves 
is NOT going to be caused by the commercial pirates,   hogging, hiding and mystifying the technology  
and  even  sabotaging  each other. However if we do manage to  start  a   non-commercial  movement  of  
pirates  capable  of  doing  this    then commercial  pirates will jump onto the airwaves, with more   
power, and try to force us off. This would be a major problem.<P>
   It  is  a  mistake and an excuse to blame the Tories and  the   new draconian laws for the lack of 
alternative pirates in  Britain. The main  thing  stopping  us  is the lack  of  any   strong  combative 
movement (whether it be workers, women,  anarchist, or whatever) in which  to  build a big wave of  
pirates, though there are literally millions of sympathetic  people about.<P>
Medium wave<P>
ADVANTAGES AND PROBLEMS<P>
   At  the  moment FM broadcasting, with all its advantages,  is   the favorite  for pirates. But it's well 
worth pointing out  that at least 25% of radio receivers in Britain can't even receive FM, so you can't pick 
up most pirates on older radios. Another thing, in some hilly areas FM broadcasts have a very bad 
coverage area.  And a third advantage, you can cover a very much bigger area on AM, at least  potentially. 
AM can be the best choice for you, especially if  you're  in a country area, or in hills or  mountains,  or  
only want  to  broadcast  by  day and aren't too   worried  about  sound quality. AM transmitters are also 
fairly  cheap and easy to  build, and  because you use a crystal there's  no problem with  tuning  or with  
'sprogs'  (harmonics). Though  the antenna is a  huge  length it's  just a roll of wire, and  doesn't 
necessarily have to  be  up high,  which gives you a  quite different, if still limited,  range of  possible  
broadcasting sites. AM works by bouncing radio  waves back off the stratosphere, not by line of sight like 
FM.<P>
   Of  course  there's  lots  of other disadvantages,  one  is   sound quality,  and stereo is out of the 
question, and there's  not  much free  space  on the wave band, chiefly because of a  host  European 
stations, which become stronger at night, blotting  your relatively weak signal (this is due to atmospheric 
changes  we are told).  The TX  is  also bigger and heavier (about 12" x  8" x 6") and   you'll probably 
need to use car batteries.<P>
   One  thing  I  forgot, if you want to reach  any  of  the   50000 prisoners in British jails, you must use 
AM, FM is still  banned  in prison, for some typically petty reason.<P>
   It is also agreed that you're generally less likely to get  busted. In the present repressive climate that's 
well worth  considering.<P>
How to broadcast on AM (540 - 1600 kHz)<P>
YOUR TRANSMITTER<P>
   Enough general talk. So you want to broadcast on AM. So here's  how to  do it. First your transmitter. 
Medium Wave transmitters  aren't so  hard  to build, any good amateur radio buff could do   it,  and 
there's people around who will build them (reckon to  spend £100 to £150).  The  technology is tried and 
tested and our  design  is  as good as any. The TX is valve operated and you use  a crystal (which you  
have to order on the chosen wave length)  which keeps  you  on frequency  without the problems of FM. 
So  you have to decide  from the start which frequency you're going  for and stick to it, or buy a  new 
crystal. When choosing your  frequency remember that it must be  divisible by 9... AM  frequencies are 
separated  by  9  kHz  by international treaty.  If your signal doesn't conform  you'll  probably  have  the  
DTI  and police down on you faster.  If  you  have problems getting a  AM transmitter you may be able to 
buy a kit  or adapt an amateur  radio transmitter.<P>
ADAPTING A AM TRANSMITTER<P>
   I'm  not  exactly an expert on this and the following  info   comes from  the US. Apparently you can 
easily buy second hand  radio  ham transmitters  and  adapt them. The best to go for  is   the  Viking 
Valiant  (200 watt) or the Viking Ranger (75 watt),  both  made  by Johnson  &amp   Co.  These ham 
radios are well built,   have  excellent audio and moreover have built in VFO's (variable  frequency 
oscillators)  which make them simple to modify to work  on the top end  of the  AM band. All you need to 
do the RF (radio  frequency) circuits is to add capacitance to the 160 meter tuned  circuits. And all you 
must  do  to  the  audio circuits is to  bypass the  first  pre-amp (assuming you're using a line level  instead 
of a mike level).  One other thing, you must bypass the  speech frequency filter, which is located between 
the 2nd pre-amp  and the driver.<P>
   When  buying such a 2nd hand ham transmitter: A) Get one with   160 meter  capability. B) Don't pay 
more than £100  for   one.  C) Make sure it has plate modulation (look inside and  check there are two  
transformers well separated from each  other). D) Don't get a 'kit built' one with strange wiring and if  
possible check the valves before buying, they're rather costly.<P>
SETTING UP YOUR AERIAL (AM)<P>
   Security precautions and preparation are the same as for  FM.   But there the similarity ends. For a start 
your total aerial  length is 1/4 your wavelength, so if your wavelength was 200  meters, for  instance,  your 
aerial would be 50 meters long! You  use  a  ordinary thin  single  strand wire. Buy a roll, keep it   on  the  
roll  and measure  it  out, meter by meter. Ideally the  aerial  would  point straight up, but that's just not 
feasible,  unless you hang it  out from the side of a tower block or a  steeple, or suspend it from  a balloon  
(only the balloon blows  away). The normal method  is  the 'dogleg'  which  works just  fine. The ideal site 
is  a  field,  or deserted  common land, far  away from houses, with two  tall  trees (only  2  if  possible,  
poplars are best) about 30  to  40  meters apart. Now string the  'dogleg' between the trees and down to  
your TX  without touching  branches or leaves. Sounds impossible? If you have  a trained  monkey that's 
just fine. Otherwise try our method. Practice and  patience is necessary.<P>
   Bring  along  with you a catapult, a long reel of 70 lb.   strength fishing line, a plenty of lead fishing 
weights (not too  heavy  for the  catapult).  Also some small plastic rings (cut   out  lids  of plastic 
containers work fine).<P>
   Tie one end of the fishing line to a lead weight, leaving the  line coiled neatly and loosely on a piece of 
bare ground. Then  fore the lead weight from the catapult right over the center of a  tree!  Go and  search 
for it (don't try this at night). Tie on  your  plastic ring in place of the weight and pass about 30 meter  of 
your aerial wire through the ring. Now get your mate to pull  the other end  of the  fishing line, if it 
doesn't get tangled  pull it till the ring is about 5 meters from the tree top. Tie  the fishing line securely (to  
the  tree), cut it, and head for  the second tree. Repeat  the performance,  firing right over the  tree from 
the far  side.  Pull the aerial end through, and this  time tie it to the ring. Pull  up as  before to about 5 m 
from  the top and tie the line. Now back to the  roll of aerial wire  (extended with fishing line as 
necessary) and  start pulling it  in till it's suspended without touching  the trees!  It's hard to  get it just 
right so the aerial reaches  your TX  and is tight,  adjust fishing line lengths and/or position of TX. Better  
choose two trees too far apart than too close. When you finally   get  it all set it's hardly worth taking  it  
down  again after  the broadcast, though you should loosen it off or it'll snap in   the  wind. Disguise it if 
possible. A further problem  can  be with  kids  and passers by, disguise your actions, bringing   along 
fishing  rods or a kite is a good ploy. One of the best   broadcast sites is a clearing in a large wood. On 
Medium Wave  remember,  you can  go  right outside the city and still cover it  and  lots  more 
besides.<P>
SETTING UP THE GEAR<P>
   The  transmitter should be on wet ground. If it's dry, wet it.  Mud is  good stuff. The aerial wire should 
be taut all the way.  Bushes are  an  advantage, for concealment, but don't let any   touch  the aerial.  Your  
power supply is a 12 volt car battery.   Bring  two, well  charged up, if you're broadcasting for more  than 
few  hours, medium wave uses a lots of power. If your TX is  on mains (240 VAC) you'll have to get it 
adapted using a 'rotary  inverter', it's  not difficult. A lorry battery is the real  thing, but what a  drag  to 
carry! If there's a chance to go on  mains, by running a line  from somewhere,  you should go for it.  
Otherwise wear old  clothes  and gloves  against acid spills.  When choosing your site  balance  the need 
for remoteness with  the problems of moving the gear.<P>
   The  transmitter  must  be  very well grounded,  the  earth   is  an essential  part of the aerial system. 
Use a ring of  metal   stakes (e.g.  tent  stakes)  and  file off any  rust  or  dirt   for  good connections. 
Attach the stakes securely to the chassis  of your TX, with  the  thick metal straps or wires held by  
butterfly  nuts  or strong clean battery clips.<P>
   So  far  so good. The cassette player, on the contrary, should   be off  the  ground, on a box or whatever. 
As usual  keep  the   audio lead, battery leads and aerial wire as far apart as  possible.  The cassette  player  
is  normally powered by  a  6   volt  motor  bike battery, with suitable leads. Torch batteries  are dear and 
have  a pathetic life-span.<P>
SWITCHING ON<P>
   Connect  up  your batteries, load up your cassette player   with  a 'trial tape' and you're ready to go.<P>
1) Turn tuning adjuster to the right till the meter  gives   the lowest reading.<P>
2) Turn 'load' adjuster till meter rises about 50 milliamps.<P>
3) Tune again till it drops about 25 mA.<P>
4) Load up again as above.<P>
5) Carry on procedure till you get a load of about 150 mA on a  20 W transmitter, or 100 mA on a 10 W  
rig.  Your  last   tuning adjustment should produce virtually no dip on the meter  needle.<P>
6) Adjust  modulation in relation to other channels to  get   your best  sound. Use a radio receiver held at 
least 50 yards  away  for testing.<P>
7) If there is crackling, knocking or bad sound, repeat from   the beginning.  Check that your stakes are in 
well damp  ground,   that all  lines  are well separated, that aerial isn't touching   trees, hold receiver 
further away etc. <P>
   If  you've done all the above you should be broadcasting loud   and clear.  If your signal is still wretched 
chances are your   crystal is burnt out, or something is blown. Then go home.<P>
   If all is well, switch off and await the time of your program  is due  to  start. Don't detach aerial wire 
with the TX still   turned on.<P>
PACKING UP<P>
   When  you're  finished,  switch off immediately.  Then   disconnect everything  and  pack into hold-alls 
or large   plastic  bag.  Be especially  careful carrying the TX with it's  delicate  valves.  You should  have 
several sites, and switch as  often as you can.  Don't re-use a site after an attempted bust.  If you have a 
good dry safe stash  and  are coming back best  leave your transmitter,  cassette deck  and  leads  there,  
and  just take  the  batteries  back  for recharging. Such a stash  should be in cover, be quite sure  a  
hidden  watcher or bud with  binoculars couldn't spot you stashing the gear.  It's likely that  the DTI will 
send in men to sneak  up  and watch you, prior to  planning a bust, so be careful, even when  not on air, 
don't  relax till safely home.<P>
WHEN ON AIR, PRECAUTIONS (AM)<P>
   Read  the  FM  chapter 'How to get away with it'. A lot  of   those precautions also apply.<P>
   At  a  AM  site your chances should be much better,  you  need   on person just to stay near the TX, in 
case of kids, passers by   etc. and  to  grab or hide it fast when they get the danger  signal.  On many  sites  
you  can work out lookout points to   give  plenty  of warning.  However  you might as well abandon   the  
batteries,  and certainly  the  aerial,  if you have  to   run  far.  If  you  have transport  or good escape 
routes you can  try a clean getaway,  but safer method is to hide the gear well  (not too close to the aerial if 
it's left up) and beat it. We  favor bunkers, holes pre-dug and lined with waterproofs, under  rocks, with 
heavy lids covered  with earth  and  bushes. In  theory they could find these with  dogs  or metal detectors, 
but  we've never heard of them succeeding or  even trying  (you could  always bury bits of metal all over 
the  place).<P>
   The possibilities are unlimited, if you're on the ball there's  no reason  they should get the gear... and 
without that they   have  a lousy case against you.<P>
Busts.... If all goes wrong<P>
   You're  nicked. What you say to them depends on the  circumstances. If they haven't got you, deny it 
point blank, give them your cover story  and a verifiable address, and stick to your story no  matter what. 
The problem with this is if they have nicked others and they give different stories, a different name for you 
etc.  Best discuss all this beforehand. If caught on the hop, best say you don't know any of the others. 
You're caught in the act or with the gear. Give them  a  verifiable  name and address and refuse  to  
discuss  the matter further. No matter what. People have managed to get off in the  past,  even with the 
gear in their hands, but under the  new laws this is unlikely.<P>
   Although they can arrest and charge you, illegal broadcasting   is still normally treated as a 'summons 
offense', which means   they question you, let you go (eventually), then summons you by   letter to  appear 
in court. This opens possibilities of getting  away with it - you may  be able to snow them with a false  
name  etc. (though they can now hold you on suspicion of doing  this for three days). They will normally 
'ask to accompany to the  station', or if they've raided your flat may interrogate you  there and  then.  If 
you refuse to go to the station they  will  arrest you (for obstruction, insulting words, suspicion of  stealing  
electricity etc.)  and take you there, where you  can be interviewed  by  the police and DTI. The 'pretext 
charge'  is often dropped later. When interviewed on the station it's  better really to  refuse  to  say 
anything,  especially if there  are several of you,  cover stories usually  fall  apart under  long and detailed 
questioning.  However silence usually means  they will hold you longer. If they get you to the station  they  
are  pretty  certain  to  photograph  and fingerprint you.  You can't refuse under the Police Bill.<P>
   When nicked your best bet is to remain calm.  Demand  to ring  your solicitor. Don't panic, it's not the  
end  of the  world.  Smile at the bastards. Have a good time in the cell -you've done  your best.<P>
Fighting your case<P>
   It's  usually months before your summons arrives, if  they   decide they  have  a case. Get legal aid if at 
all possible, and   a  good solicitor  who knows the, by now, pretty complex legal   situation.<P>
   Plead  NOT  GUILTY, but beware if you have money, they  may   award costs against you if you lose. 
Get your Bust Fund  together,  with gigs, jumble, radio appeals, donations all round  etc. It's good to 
campaign  about  your  bust on the air if your   station  is  still going. Most commercial (read conservative)  
pirates don't do  this, carrying their bid for respectability so  far as to ignore  their own best weapon. Make  
sure the address  you gave when arrested  is 'clean',  they  could  possibly  raid   you  to  look  for  further 
evidence.  If you're a political  station watch out for  suspicious break-ins where nothing is  stolen, the 
Branch often do this. Get  your  story  straight,   get  witnesses  to  write  out  their statements  together, 
make  copies and give them to your solicitor.<P>
   Don't  trust  your  solicitor too far, they sometimes  say   'plead guilty'  just to save themselves trouble, if 
he/she starts  getting cold feet get yourself a new one (they don't like this at  all  but it  can  be  done). Get 
your solicitor to ask for   copies  of  the prosecutions  witness statements in advance of  the case  and  
make sure  you  see  them. In court dress neatly  and be polite  to  the bastard (magistrate) and the filth. 
Have a  good 'hard luck'  story for  your  solicitor to tell, it's always  good to say you're  just getting  
married, starting a new job  etc., but don't say you  have money  or  the fines will be bumped  up higher. If 
you're going  to 'bend  the truth' a little don't  tell your solicitor you're  doing it,  and  be sure friends  
watching in court don't start  laughing!<P>
   The DTI and police will lie anyway, more likely than not, get  your witnesses to focus on these lies and 
your solicitor to cross   question  them closely, especially any police witnesses, who are   more stupid  and  
inexperienced in this kind  of  case.     <P>
   Demonstrations outside  the  court  are  good publicity and   can  intimidate  the magistrate if big 
enough, but don't always  help your case (e.g. if you're pleading 'dumb bystander' how come  all these 
people are  so concerned about you?). If you want  press, send out Press  Releases at  least  a  week in 
advance, so  the hacks can put  it  in  their diaries, and phone sound with  reminders the day before. Your  
fine should be paid by the Bust Fund if at all possible.  If not, extra costs  should be divided up among 
everyone in the station (always plead  poverty and ask for time to pay). When  you've been busted once  
you shouldn't, ideally, work on the broadcasting end again,  though you could still do lookout, backup, 
monitoring  etc.,  as  second offenders normally  get  the  maximum fine.<P>
   If you win the case, as quite often happens, have a good  party! If  you  win there is also some 
possibility, in theory of  claiming the gear back, though this is much less likely under the  new laws.<P>
   Ask  your  solicitor  about it, and there's a chance  get   someone else,  with  some kind of receipt, to 
apply for it,  saying  they'd bought it before the bust.<P>

<H1><A NAME = V></A>V. The KZAR 
Story</H1>
<P>
   If you can't afford the outrageous price-tag required to start a  licensed radio station, if you've tired of 
commercial alternative  stations that play Nirvana ad nauseam, don't fret.<P>
   It's easy for you to take matters into your own hands. Try  this recipe for making your own radio waves: 
1) Know the right  electronics equipment dealers in town, they'll hook you up with  parts to make a 
transmitter (about $50 per 5 watts: you'll  probably want at least 20 watts); 2) Buy an antenna, a  
microphone, maybe a filter, a mixer and a CD player; 3) Round up  your friends, vote on a format, choose 
a frequency, boost your  power, then snub your nose at the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC).  
You owe it to yourself.  After all, you broke  the rules -- or, more exactly, the law.<P>
   This rebellious, and, when you add music, romantic stealing of the airwaves was played out by Christian 
Slater in 1990's "Pump  Up the Volume."  In Salt Lake City recently, it's become radio  reality on 
Saturday nights at 11:30, sans the "young - man - with  - something - to - say" attitude of the Hollywood 
movie.<P>
   Promoting itself by way of flyers in Salt Lake City coffee shops, KZAR, or Zion Alternative Radio, 
prides itself as a breed  apart from "those commercial money-grubbing giants."  That  explains its 
"measly" output power of 35 watts.<P>
   "After extensive research and help from listeners," so says the station's voice mail, four areas were 
scouted for best  reception. Guaranteeing that Salt Lake's upper-class won't be  deprived of pirate radio, 
KZAR comes in best in the Olympus Cove  and East Benches area.<P>
   The other three are the Murray Area, the West Valley Area,  and, naturally, the higher North Benches 
and Capitol Area.  If  you want to listen to KZAR in domestic comfort, you've got to  wire up your receiver 
and string an antenna out the window.   Otherwise, KZAR is radio for the road.<P>
   Nestled between KBYU (89.1) and KUER (90.1), KZAR seats its throne at 89.5 FM.  Station manager 
Dmitri Baughman (a pseudonym) chose a lower band because, reportedly, the FCC is more lenient  on 
pirate (unlicensed) broadcasters using the educational  frequencies, as opposed to the higher frequencies of 
commercial  radio.  Pirate radio is not a violation the FCC takes lightly. "They [pirate stations] are illegal.  
The FCC has sole  jurisdiction over airwaves and broadcast signals for the public  domain," said Tom 
Hora, public affairs officer for FCC's eastern  California field office, which regulates Utah airwaves.      
<P>
   Recently, in California operators for the station Free Radio Berkeley were apprehended and fined 
$20,000.  Federal regulations governing radio stem from the Communication Act of 1934, which  ruled 
that the airwaves, unlike print media, are public, not  private property.  The United States isn't alone, as 
Italy is the  only country that doesn't crack down on free radio operators.   Hora makes the point that 
pirate broadcasters interfere with  other stations' legitimate use, cost consumers money, and even  
endanger lives.<P>
   "What if a commercial airline can't reach the control tower<P>
because of a pirate frequency?  It has to turn around and try  again.<P>
   That costs the airline fuel, which is passed on to consumers,"  Hora says.  "What if the pirate frequency 
jams communication  between police and firemen and they can't respond to an  emergency?" he says with 
a wild voice.<P>
   The FCC isn't even the least bit curious about why people broadcast illegally.  Pirates are just a pain in 
the neck.  "Why  do people shoplift?  Why do people do things they shouldn't do?   It's impossible to 
determine," says FCC engineer Bill Zears.<P>
   Nationwide, the motives are as varied as the U.S. population.<P>
Until recently, an Illinois man used his homemade station to  broadcast jazz and black nationalist news 
and opinions on such  topics as police brutality.  In Michigan, one couple used a  transmitter to broadcast 
anti-gay propaganda, and, of course,  Neo-nazis get in on the act.<P>
   Overseas, the aim is more about music. English pirate station Caroline even led directly to the country's 
first popular music station, BBC's Radio 1.<P>
   Baughman's motives are personal and political, not overtly<P>
malicious or sociopathic.  His first introduction to the idea was through the computer network, Internet.  
Since then, he's been broadcasting on-and-off since late June.  Understandably,  Baughman declined an 
in-person interview and photos.<P>
   "To be honest, I like to play DJ.  It's a small movement and I wanted to be part of it.  I'm pretty much 
anti-government  anyway," he says.  Baughman and his group of "sandbox" radio  enthusiasts, as he puts 
it, have enough power to broadcast over  the entire valley, but need a higher antenna, an item that's next  
in line for purchase.<P>
   The listening menu is a loose "alternative" format that, disappointingly, often veers on the commercial, 
especially on  Chloe Devereaux's "Blood, Death, and Roses" segment of the  broadcast.  The The, New 
Order and INXS are probably the last  bands you'd expect to hear on a pirate station.  They're easy  
pickings on commercial radio, but KZAR is proud to bring them to  you.  Broadcasting into 4 a.m., 
however, the mix became more  subversive: Meat Beat Manifesto, Sex Gang Children, and  techno-rave 
beats.<P>
   The best feature of KZAR is its news segment, chock full of enough conspiracy theories to make Oliver 
Stone look like an  amateur. News item: "The U.S. Government is using  closed-captioned decoders 
installed in TV sets to obtain  classified information about American homes."<P>
   Pirate radio's national agenda reaches far above mere music, though.  According to Baughman, its true 
goal is to obtain FCC  rights for micro-broadcasting licenses, more reasonable  licensing costs, and get 
FCC bureaucrats to tune in to the  positive effects of small stations serving the community.<P>
   That will be a long time coming.  Until then, Baughman and crew will turn on the transmitter every 
Saturday night and claim  a small piece of turf among Salt Lake City's 40-odd radio  stations.<P>
   Other stations have yet to complain to the FCC about any  signal interference.<P>
   "I really don't give it [pirate radio] much legal thought,"<P>
Baughman says.  "When something does happen and I do get caught,  I'll worry about it then."<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME = VI></A>VI. The 
Ramsey FM-10 micro-transmitter.</H1>
   Here is a compilation of information about the Ramsey FM-10,  and other BA1404 Stereo FM 
broadcasters.  Some of the  modifications may make your BA1404 based broadcaster illegal to  use on the 
open airwaves in the US and Canada.  Also it has been  brought up that the stock Ramsey FM-10 kit may 
exceed FCC power  limits when used with a proper antenna.<P>
 Recommended Test Equipment<P>
   An SWR/Power meter is a giant help, a CB to 2 meter one will  suffice. Power readings will not be 
accurate, but can be useful  for peaking. The most important part is the SWR meter, this is  very important 
when making an antenna.<P>
   A note on power meters: The above power meters are recommended  because they are inexpensive and 
most people that are interested  in hacking a FM-10 have very limited funds.  These are by no  means 
accurate, but they will give you some idea what is going  on.  If you can spend the money you can get an 
accurate power  meter that is designed for this band, but the cost is 10-15 times  more.<P>
   A 50 ohm non inductive load is also very helpful, for low  power applications a 50 ohm 1/4 or 1/2 watt 
carbon resistor works  well.  This can be used to tune up your kit and amp without  interfering with 
anyone.  Also note that you can run as much  power you want, legally, as long is it doesn't radiate.<P>
   A VOM is also very helpful.  It is worth the extra bucks and  buy one with a frequency counter (if you 
shop around, about  $60-$70).  Buy the one that covers audio to 20 MHz (or more).  If  you are serious 
about electronics you need one of these! <P>
Dummy load<P>
   Dummy loads are great for testing, without radiating a signal.   In fact you can run as much power as 
you want into one of these  things legally!<P>
   Basically you want to create a non-inductive 50 ohm load.   This can be done with regular carbon 
resistors, or by buying pre  built Amateur or CB radio loads.  For low power ( &lt .5 watt ) an  ethernet 
terminator works well (check temperature when using if  it gets very hot lower input power, if it is still 
cool you may  be able to go up to .75 watt.) Most CB loads use a 2 watt carbon  50 ohm resistor.<P>
   You can build your own, as wimpy or as sturdily as you want by  running resistors in parallel to create 
50 ohms.  i.e., 2 100 ohm  1/4 watt resistors will create a 1/2 watt 50 ohm load...<P>
   Do not use 50 ohm wire wound resistors, they are not 50 ohms  at radio frequencies.   <P>

    currently on board<P>
    * you can also use 2 440 ohm 1/4 watt resistors run in parallel<P>
     This thing can be built right on the underside of the FM-10  kit, C1 is the cap that currently goes to the 
RCA ant jack, the  9k and the 220 ohm resistor have to be bought, note that if you  cannot find 220 ohms 
you can make one by using 2 440 ohm  resistors in parallel, and that a 10k will work in place of the  9k 
but yields poorer performance (-5%).<P>
   The MPS2222A is from Radio Shack part number 276-2009, use  this part! If you substitute it for a 
2N2222A you will get only  half the gain.  Be very careful to get the leads in the correct  orientation!<P>
   The 2N4401 can be used in place of the MPS2222A with a little  better performance, about 5 mw more.  
The 2N4401 can be found at  Radio Shack, too.<P>
   C2 is of the same value of C1, this is the one that goes to  the on board antenna pad.<P>
   Important, the value for R1 that seems to be optimal is 220  ohms, but it is very close to the sat point, If 
the amp seems  noisy (interferes with the TV etc.) back this value off to 240  ohms.  If you lower this 
value below 205 ohms the power meter may  read higher power but this will not be true, the transistor will  
be spewing all kinds of junk and the power meter will mistake  this for higher output (in reality the signal 
we want will drop<P>
considerably.)<P>
   After this modification the, effective range with a good  antenna should be a little over double.<P>
  Ramsey PA-1 2-meter to 3-meter conversion mod<P>
   The Ramsey 2-meter amp (PA-1) can be converted for use on the  FM broadcast band.  The inductors L1 
and L2 need to be changed to  the following: <P>
 L1 -    Should be replaced with a 1-turn 1/4" diameter coil,  Identical to the stock L2 shown in the PA-1 
manual.<P>
 L2 -    Should be replaced with a 2 turn 1/4" diameter coil,  one more turn than the above coil.<P>
  Tune up should be the same as in the PA-1 Manual.  Note that a  FM-10 kit cannot be used to drive a 
PA-1 kit alone.  The FM-10  kit doesn't put out enough power to turn on the PA-1 kit running  class-c.  So 
you have two options.  One, you can do the "biased  on" (newer kits may call this class-b) modification 
shown in the  PA-1 manual.  Doing this you can drive the PA-1 with a stock  FM-10, yielding about 200-
300mw of output power.  Or two, you can  drive the PA-1 with the output of the 70 mw amp shown above 
and  get close to a watt of output power.<P>
   It should be noted here that running the PA-1 "biased on" (or  class-b) produces a much cleaner output 
signal than running the  PA-1 class-c.  Also that you can run the PA-1 "biased on" while  driving it with 
the 70 mw amp, but you will show slightly less  gain than in class-c.<P>
ANTENNAS  <P>
   Antenna are the most important thing that  you can do for  extended range.  A 1/4 wave ground plane 
can be built using a UHF  connector and 5 lengths of copper plated brazing rod (found at  the local 
welding shop).  Works great and only cost $3 dollars to  make.<P>
   Remember good antenna will improve you range much further than  a good amp into a bad antenna.  So 
this should be your 1st  project to increase your range.<P>
  Use the formulas out of your FM-10 manual  234/freq=length of  rod.<P>
  Example : 234/88Mhz = 2.66 feet * 12 in/feet = 31.9" -or-<P>
            234/108Mhz= 2.17 feet * 12 in/feet = 26"<P>
  Insert the 4 ground plane rods in the 4 holes of the UHF  connector, stick them through about 1/4 inch 
and solder.  Solder  the radiator in the top of the UHF connector (you may have to  grind it a bit to fit.)  
Then bend the ground plane rods to a 45  degree angle to the radiator.  This makes a very effective  
antenna, just connect with a 50 ohm CB cable to your amplified  Ramsey, stick the antenna in a tree or in 
another high place and  you should have 1 miles of solid coverage (when using the above  amp.).<P>
   If you have an SWR meter you can cut the rods a little longer  and start clipping the ends off a little 
until you get the best  SWR reading.<P>
   Be careful when you bend the brazing rod, don't break the  connector. Grab the rod right below the 
connector with a pair of  vice-grips and bend the brazing rod at that point.<P>
   Try not to have anything metal near the radiator, this will  effect the radiation pattern. The radiation 
pattern should look  a lot like a deformed doughnut surrounding the radiator<P>
On The Road<P>
   Old magnet mount CB antennas can make great mobile antennas,  simply take the base load out of them 
and cut the radiator to 1/4  wave length.<P>
   If you need a longer radiator than the one that comes with the  antenna use the above mentioned brazing 
rod.<P>
   This antenna works great!  It is better than a dipole and you  can drive to a high, optimal location for 
your broadcasts (and  you can see the vans coming for miles.   Also with this setup you  need very little 
coax cable.  Line loss using RG-58u can be  killer at 100MHz. You could also try a 5/8 wave length 
antenna, this would give  you 2+db gain, or almost 2 times power gain on transmit.<P>
Filter design for FM Radio Transmitters.<P>
   It is very important to have a clean signal. 99% of all people  who get busted for illegal transmitting is 
that the neighbors complain about interference.  Most of this interference is caused  by harmonics. Filters 
cut down these spurs. Don't draw  attention to yourself, be clean, and use a filter.<P>
   When you amplify a signal, you get unwanted by-products these  are called harmonics.  The show up at 
multiples of your starting  frequency.  For example, if you amplify a 50MHz signal you may  get spurious 
signals on 100MHz, 150MHz, 200MHz, 250MHz...  If you  interfere with your neighbors TV, the local 
fire department, or  anyone else, you are just asking for trouble.  If you are only on the FM Band with a 
clean signal, you will hardly be noticed.<P>

  The tough part in the above is winding the coils. 3t of #12  wire 1/2" diameter should be about .12 uh. 4t 
is .17 uh. (but ugh,  #12 wire is big stuff). You could just use molded inductors,  these work well.  Try to

spectrum analyzer available for tuning the filters.<P>

parts.  The inductor  is one of those molded units that looks like a resistor so you  can make this very 
small.  You may stack these things to make a  better filter.   Each stage will knock the 2nd harmonic 
down  about 15db.<P>
   Use the above cap values depending on which frequency range  you want to operate at.  i.e.. if you run 
87-90 use the 88MHz  values,  90-103 use 102MHz values, and above that use 107MHz values.  Try to use 
fixed value parts!<P>
   [Also of interest is that the FM-10 puts out about 8-9mw and  the 2nd harmonic is -25db off the 
fundamental (frequency we are  broadcasting on).  The FM-4 Kit by Ramsey puts out 130mw and the  2nd 
harmonic is only -12db off the fundamental, which means the  2nd harmonic of the FM-4 is about as 
powerful as the FM-10.  db  is log10, i.e. 3db is 2 times 6db is 4 times...]<P>
  <P>
FM-10 Myths<P>
   There have been several myths about the FM-10 kit, the most  prevalent are :<P>
  1) The FM-10 puts out 100mw of power.  This is not true, or at  least not true for common Ramsey FM-
10's.  They put out between 8 and 12mw when driven with a 12 volt supply.  (Note: there has  been several 
revisions of the FM-10, it is possible that the  original version put out more power, but that is highly 
unlikely  since it would require another amplifier stage.) Also the FM-10  is the only low cost kit with an 
amplifier stage.  Most others  have power outputs in the fraction of a mw area.<P>
  2) The FM-10's output can be cranked up by reducing the value  of R9.  This, like the above is not true.  
R9 and R10 are  optimized for maximum output and greatest harmonic suppression at  12 volts.  There 
are much better ways of getting more output  power than to mess with this output stage.  Lowering the 
value of  R9 will most likely degrade the FM-10's performance and cause  lots of interference.<P>
FM-10 Improvements <P>
Stereo Pilot Mod<P>
   One of the first problems experienced with the FM-10 is  difficulty in getting the stereo pilot to operate 
correctly.  One  solution is to replace C7 and C8 with a 38KHz crystal,  this  works the best and is 
recommended.  If you cannot find a 38KHz  crystal, you can make your life a whole lot easier with a 
couple  part changes.  As indicated on the Ramsey schematic, about 110pF  is necessary to tune the 
oscillator.  The components supplied to  achieve this are a small fixed value capacitor (C7) and a  slightly 
larger value trimmer (C8).  Since proper setting of the trimmer occurs within a very small 'window' (about 
5% of the  trimmers range), it can bet difficult or impossible to adjust the  pilot to 19KHz and have it stay 
put.  This can be cured by  increasing the value of c7 to 100pF and replacing c8 with a  6-50pF trimmer 
(Radio Shack #272-1340); a 5-30pF trimmer will do  the trick.  The RS trimmer will not fit the holes in 
the pc  board; one needs to cut the leads off a spare resistor and solder  them to the legs of the trimmer 
(just use bits of wire) to mount it on the component side of the board.<P>
   On a 2nd note: Replace c7 with a 68pF cap and it is much  easier to tune a rock solid 19KHz at the test 
point.<P>
<P>
NOTE: Ramsey now includes a crystal with all FM-10 kits. Owners  of the old kits can contact Ramsey 
for an upgrade kit, which  includes a crystal.  <P>
<P>

          |    |           |        |<P>
  <P>
  Remove C7 and C8, replace with 38KHz crystal and 10pF cap.   Note that the 10pF cap and the crystal 
are running series and the  old cap setup is running in parallel.<P>
   Note: there have been good and bad reports on using the Epson  crystal from digi-key.  People say the 
crystal is quite delicate,  and in at least one case the experimenter destroyed the crystal.<P>
   In one of the positive cases, C1's 10pF cap was replaced by 2  22pF caps run in parallel, this yielded a 
rock solid stereo.<P>
  <P>
Treble Boost Mod-<P>
   Treble boost (pre-emphasis) improvement.  The FM-10 appears to  have been designed by someone 
outside the United States since it  operates at the European audio standard of 50 microseconds.  Receivers 
in the US are set up for 75 microsecond de-emphasis.  R3 and R6 determine the time constant for the pre-
emphasis curve.  Replacing them with 75K ohm resistors (standard value 68K ohm is  close enough) will 
result in improved audio response.<P>
   A much better pre-emphasis/input circuit is shown in the July  1992 issue of "Radio Electronics".  Not 
only do they use 75K ohm  resistors in there pre-emphasis, but they filter stray RF signals  by inserting a 
.001 cap between pin 1 (of the BA1404) and ground,  and pin 18 and ground.<P>
   It has been noted that the above mod may actually cause  distortion on cheaper stereo receivers, since 
they were mass  produced for the world market, they were designed for the  European audio standard, 
which Japan and other Asian nations use  too.  Try it out, let me know what works for you.<P>
  <P>
Anti-Drift Mod<P>
   There has been quite a bit of discussion on the FM-10's  frequency stability. Complaints that digital 
receivers cannot  lock onto the FM-10's signal for any great length of time. The  below mod has been used 
with good results using a N750 negative  temperature compensated disc, but Mylar or Polystyrene caps are  
even better.<P>
   The FM-10 was designed to be inexpensive and cost-saving  measures with components are inevitable. 
Disc ceramic capacitors  are less expensive than silver-mica caps, and also much less  stable.  Simply 
replace c16 with a silver-mica, tantalum or  negative temperature compensated disc (say anywhere from 
N150 to  N750) cap of the same value.<P>

   The 2SC2570 is supposedly replaceable with an ECG10.  The  MRF901 can also be used as a 
replacement, although it is tough to  mount. Try mounting it on the bottom of the pc board and  
connecting the whip antenna pad to ground plane. MPS901s seem to  replace the 2SC2570 directly. They 
use the same case, but check  the pin-outs.  MPS918s work well also.<P>

<H1><A NAME = VII></A>VII. A TV 
Transmitter</H1>
<P>
  For some time now it has been possible to construct a  clandestine television station, which you can 
operate from your  Telecommando Lair, or modify or Mobile Media Guerrilla campaigns.<P>
   This device has been named the Snow Box, due to its cool  nature, and the snow seen on blank 
television channels waiting to  be commandeered.<P>
   To put together a TV station you will need this stuff:<P>
<P>
1) A VCR or Camcorder with video or RF outputs<P>
<P>
2) A Ham Radio 6-meter Band Linear amplifier<P>
This boosts the RF signal from the VCR for broadcasting. The Linear Amp should have a bandwidth of 6 
MHz for best  results. A cable television RF distribution amplifier may also be  used.<P>
<P>
3) Coaxial cable with UHF connectors<P>
(Connects the Linear Amp to the Antenna)<P>
<P>
4) A cable-TV patch cable with an F-connector and a UHF connector. (To connect the RF signal to the 
Linear Amp) (F-connectors are the small ones used with cable TV) (UHF connectors are the large  ones 
used for Ham Radio)<P>
<P>
If your VCR does not have RF outputs:<P>
<P>
   An external RF modulator (converts video to channel 3,6,12  etc.), a cable with RCA connectors (a 
standard stereo cord is ok)<P>
<P>
5) A 6-meter Ham radio antenna.<P>
If you do not have a pre-made 6-meter antenna:<P>
     About 20 feet of strong wire<P>
     3 ceramic antenna insulators<P>
     another UHF connector<P>
<P>
   Likely places to get the linear amplifier, connectors and  cables is a Ham Radio swapmeet, a Ham club 
newsletter's  classified ads, a Buy-Sell-Trade paper like The Recycler, or at a  store specializing in Ham 
gear.<P>
   RF modulators are available at specialty video stores, or  major VCR dealers.<P>

   The antenna is set up much like a clothesline with the wires  tethered straight out horizontally. The 
outer insulators are used  to isolate the antenna from the tether lines, which should be  rope or nylon cords 
for good results. The inner insulator  isolates a gap between the two long wires of the antenna.<P>
   The length of the wires used for the antenna is critical. Look  up the length in feet for the channel you 
want to use in the  table below &amp  make each of the two long wires that length.<P>
   As a rule of thumb, a wire half-wave antenna's length in feet  is equal to 468 divided by the frequency in 
MHz.<P>

<P>
Uses for a TV Clandestine Station:<P>
<P>
   Public Education: Make a videotape of each step in the process  of constructing your transmitter. Show 
this tape in your  broadcasts, "For informational purposes only", of course.<P>
   Short-burst zipping: From a fixed or mobile base of operation  show short snippets of graffiti-like 
computer graphics, quick  subliminal messages, images &amp  suggestions, or brief phreaker  manifestos. 
Commercials are an opportune time to break into TV  broadcasts.<P>
   Live call-in shows: Using a Cheese Box, or other device for  receiving untraceable phone calls and a 
video camera do a live  call-in show. Encourage people to call in using Red, Blue, and  other phreaking 
boxes.<P>
   Cable TV Piracy: With modifications it may be possible to feed  the power RF signal directly into a 
cable TV system, overriding  cablecasts or commandeering unused channels.<P>
   Mobile Operation: Using storage batteries and a 110-volt  inverter the transmitter may be modified for 
mobile use to avoid  detection by the FCC during long broadcasts. Battery operated  mobile linear amps 
and portable camcorders are also available.<P>

* ASSEMBLY: Watch it with static around the TMOS transistor.  It  is VERY sensitive.  If there's any

Mount the TMOS flange to a metal box with some heatsink compound.   Ground your PCB to the same 
cabinet.<P>
<P>
* TESTING: Connect the output to a dummy load which can handle  the power level you'll be generating.  
Set the trimpot at  mid-range and apply your 12 or 24V. At this point, the power  transistor shouldn't get 
warm until you turn the pot up more.  If  it does start to warm up, turn the pot down a bit until the  
temperature remains the same or lowers.  DO NOT adjust past this  point.  Now feed your RF signal to the 
amp's input.  Use C3  (tuning) and C4 (load) to adjust for maximum output.  You may  also have to 
readjust R2 for the best reading.  Keep an eye on  the meter for sudden jumps in output - this shouldn't 
happen.<P>
<P>
* TROUBLESHOOTING: If tuning is erratic, the amp is probably  going into self-oscillation which can 
be caused by insufficient  grounding, bypassing of the power supply leads, too long of input  or output 
wires, or too high a bias.<P>
<P>
* PARTS: Contact "RF Parts" at 619-744-0728 for the transistor  you choose.  Ask them for their latest 
flyer, too.  It's free.   Your local electronics supplier other than Radio Shack ought to  have everything else 
you'll need (at least mine does!).  If not,  try "Mouser Electronics" at 800-346-6873 and get their free<P>
catalog, too.<P>

DESCRIPTION:<P>
   This is a vertically polarized omnidirectional free space  antenna which offers approximately 1.8dB of 
gain.  It has a  radiation efficiency 50% better than a ground-plane antenna due  to its low radiation angle, 
it is unobtrusive, and has no  ground-plane radials - therefore low wind resistance.<P>
   Why Slim Jim?  Well this stems from its slender construction  and the use of a 'J' type matching stub (J 
integrated matching =  JIM) that facilitates feeding the antenna at the base thus  overcoming and 
problems of interaction between feeder and  antenna.  The feed impedance is 50 ohms.<P>
   Why is the Slim Jim so much more efficient than the popular  5/8 wave or other ground plane antennas, 
despite the latter's  claimed 3dB over a dipole?  The Slim Jim vertical angle of  radiation is almost parallel 
to ground so maximum radiation is  where it is needed: straight out and all round.  (The included diagram 
illustrates that the vertical angle from the SJ is 8  degrees, while the common 5/8th wave ground plane 
antenna is  about 32 degrees.)  With all ground planes, including those with  radials an entire wavelength 
long, the vertical angle radiation  is tilted upwards at an angle of 30 degrees or more.<P>
   This gives the Slim Jim a gain over a 5/8th wave of 6dB when  measured parallel to the ground!<P>
<P>
OPERATION:<P>
   Basically it is an end-fed folded dipole operated vertically.   The matching stub provides a low 
impedance feed point (50 ohms)  at the base and couples to the antenna section at high impedance  at one 
end.  As with all folded dipoles, the currents in each leg  are in phase, whereas in the matching stub they 
in phase  opposition, so little or no radiation occurs from this.  (See  diagram for current direction 
arrows.)  Correctly matched, the  VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio) will be much less than 1.5:1,  
and remains so across the band.<P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION:<P>
   The Slim Jim should be constructed from 1/2" copper pipe.  The  bends are made with soldered 90 
degree copper elbows.  A slip  sleeve made from copper can be added to the element above the gap  for 
tuning purposes, although the average length of the gap and  spacing between the elements is 3" at 
72MHz and 1" at 220MHz.  No  part of the antenna should be grounded to the tower or mast.  The 
recommended mount is the use of PVC pipe and PVC pipe "T's."     <P>
   Make sure the space between the tower or mast and the antenna  is one "freespace" 1/4 wavelength.<P>
<P>
TESTING:<P>
   Stand upright (on a railing or something, but clear of metal  water tanks,  drainpipes, etc.) and fit the 
coaxial cable to the  antenna with some crocodile clips.  Attach about 2 inches up from  the bottom and 
check the VSWR.  Adjust the clips up or down to  get the best match (mine managed 1.2:1), mark where 
they are to  go, remove the clips, and solder the coax directly.  Use the  copper sleeve, if added, for any 
necessary tuning.<P>

<H1><A NAME = X></A>X. A 15 Watt 
Phase Locked FM Transmitter</H1>
   This simple little phase-locked transmitter is both easy to  build, and extremely stable. It will not 
frequency drift, like  the other transmitters presented in this book.<P>
   The frequency is set by first adjusting the variable inductor  in the oscillator circuit to near the desired 
frequency. After  the oscillator is close, program the dip switches with the  desired frequency. <P>
   The dip switches are programmed with a binary representation  of the operating frequency. For 
example, if the frequency is 88.1  Mhz, you would take the binary of 881, which is 000011101. A one  
means that the switch is on the 'ON' position. Note that the  right most bit is 1024, and the left most is 
1.<P>

<H1><A NAME = XI></A>XI. The 
BA1404 stereo transmitter IC</H1>
<P>
   Around 1988, the Rohm company introduced a revolutionary IC.  This IC has a complete stereo 
generator and transmitter on chip.  This allows one to build extremely small and light-weight  
transmitters.<P>
   The main drawback of the BA1404 is that it only has an output  of 8 to 10 mW. This can be amplified. 
See the FM-10 section.<P>
   Following are complete specifications for the '1404, as well  as a couple good schematics for 
constructing a transmitter that  is similar to the Ramsey FM-10.<P>
