DTMF decoder DEMO version
Shima-nized Advanced Utilities - J.M. Shima
===========================================


INTRODUCTION
------------

* This program is capable of decoding DTMF tones from a given input file
  that has been sampled at a 8kHz sampling rate.
* The source file has to be binary or a Soundblaster 8-bit .VOC file.

* This program accepts COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS that are passed to the
  DTMF decoder.
* For a list of the arguments, type DTMF_D at the DOS prompt.
* The DEMO only decodes a maximum of 5 numbers.  Interested
  persons can receive the full-blown version with no limitations.
* An example of the input arguments are:


Usage:  DTMF_D <in_file> <thresh> <sblast>

<in_file> --> input sound file name.

<thresh> -->  The threshold that the DTMF tones must exceed over the
              noise floor for detection (in dB).  Typically, strong
              DTMF tones will be 20-40 dB stronger than the noise
              in the signal.  However, noisy signals lower this
              signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio.  The threshold parameter
              allows the user to set the S/N threshold for detection.
              NOTE:  If nothing is entered, then the default thresh value
              is 20dB.

<sblast> --> Set to this to a 1 for a Sounblaster .VOC file, else set
             it to 0.  NOTE: If nothing is entered, the default is 1, i.e.
             a .VOC file is selected.


IMPORTANT NOTES BEFORE USE
--------------------------

** For the DEMO program, your input .VOC or binary file * MUST BE SAMPLED *
   at a 8kHz rate (no exceptions) for correct results.
   The industry standard for DTMF sampling is 8kHz, and this demo program
   uses that sample rate in its calculations!!


EXAMPLES of running DTMF_D:
---------------------------

DTMF_D dtmf800.voc 25 1   --> input file is dtmf800.voc, threshold S/N
                              ratio is 25dB, soundblaster .VOC file type is
                              selected.

DTMF_D dtmf800.voc        --> input file is dtmf800.voc, threshold DEFAULTS
                              to 20dB S/N ratio, soundblaster file type
                              is selected by DEFAULT.

DTMF_D junk.dat 20 0      --> input file is junk.dat, thresh=20dB, binary
                              file type is selected.


INCLUDED FILES:
---------------

DTMF_D.EXE   -->  DTMF demo decoder.
DTMF800.VOC  -->  DTMF number 1-800-555-1212 stored in a .VOC file.
DTMF_D.DOC   -->  This file.


REGISTRATION
------------

The enhanced version of this program allows unlimited decoding of numbers,
and will offer other features.
I am in the works of adding options such as:

1) logging the decoded numbers to a file.

2) allowing a list of files to be inputted, so uninterrupted decoding and
   logging happens without user intervention.

** REGISTERED users will also receive a DTMF generator program.  This is
   a DTMF tone generator which allows you to create any DTMF sequence
   you wish.  The program allows you to specify a DTMF number sequence,
   the sampling rate, and how long you want the pulses to be (in samples).


LICENSE
-------

The DEMO version of the DTMF decoder is shareware, and is free to be
used for personal use only.  This is true as long as the DEMO is
not alterted in any fashion.  Registered users will receive the enhanced
version of the DTMF decoder and will receive documentation stating such.

I have thoroughly tested this code and am not responsible for any mishaps
that may happen when launched on your computer.  The code was tested on
a IBM compatible 25MHz 386DX with a Soundblaster Ver. 1.5, 8-bit sound card.
Every action has been taken to ensure an error-free program.

Use this program at your own risk, as I assume no responsibility in your
actions while you are using this program.  Invoking the program is your
compliance to this statement.


Good luck!

Algorithm background:
=====================

DTMF_D performs a Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) on the incoming data stream
acquired from the input sound file.
The FFT transforms time-domain data into frequency-domain data.
Before the FFTs are performed, the input data is also windowed with a Hamming
window in order to reduce side-lobe leakage in the frequency domain.

A nonparametric spectral estimation method known as the Welch
method (50% overlap) is performed via the FFT and the DTMF frequencies
are monitored for activity.  The analysis is computationally expensive
because overlapping FFTs must be performed to reduce spectral variance
and perform a smoothing operation through spectral averaging.  Also, the
noise floor is recalculated with every FFT and the threshold is adaptively
calculated in order to reduce false detection of DTMF tones.

Since DTMF tones are at least 50-65ms long, and can be as long as 255ms, the
FFT must have enough spectral resolution to decipher the DTMF frequencies.
Thus, with the standard 8kHz sample rate used in industry, a
256-pt. FFT gives spectral resolution of 8kHz / 256 = 31.25 Hz.  This is
enough resolution to resolve all DTMF frequencies since the closest freqs.
are around 100 Hz apart.
