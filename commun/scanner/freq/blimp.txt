  Here are a few frequencies you might want to monitor if you ever see one  
  of the Goodyear Blimps fly overhead. A couple quick notes first, there are 
  three Blimps in operation in North America a fourth is operated in Europe. 
  The American blimps are stationed at three locations, one on each coast    
  and one in-between. The Enterprise, tail number N1A, is based in Pompano   
  Beach, Florida: the America, tail number N3A, is based near Houston, Texas 
  and the Columbia, tail number N4A, is based in Los Angeles.              
  Each blimp is accompanied by a three vehicle ground fleet consisting of a  
  van, a tractor-trailer, and a Greyhound-like bus.                          
                                                                             
  The communications between the blimp and ground crew are normally held on  
  151.625 Mhz. The blimp also uses VHF aircraft band, communications can be  
  monitored here at 132.00 Mhz. AM. Below is a list of other frequencies used
