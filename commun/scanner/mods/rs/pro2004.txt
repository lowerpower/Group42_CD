
            6,400 CHANNELS FOR YOUR PRO-2004 SCANNER

Chicagoan Denny Beringer sent in a few sheets he picked up at Dayton
describing a modification to expand the memory in the Radio Shack PRO-2004
scanner from 300 to 6,400 channels.

   The new circuitry adds 3 ICs, a 7 segment readout, a ribbon cable, a
pushbutton switch, and a few resistors and capacitors.

   First, diode D510 is added which expands the scanner from 300  to  400
channels. Then, IC504, the stock memory memory IC (a uPD446G), is removed and
replaced by a  ribbon cable leading to an added printed circuit board. The
additional board contains an HM62256 32Kx8 static RAM IC, which holds 16
groups of 400 channels each.  (note: if you don't do diode D510, I think
you'll get 4800 channels, though I haven't tried any of this. I heard that the
400 channel mod makes the markings on the 2004 keyboard incorrect.  WA2ISE)

   A pushbutton switch, attached to a 4060 CMOS 14 bit binary counter IC,
selects one of the 16 groups.  The 4 counter output leads are used to select
the high order 4 bits of the HM62256.  The new group select pushbutton switch
is mounted on the front panel, in place of the headphone jack.

   How can you tell which group you are in?  A specially programmed  EPROM
(type 2716, 2532, or 2732) is addressed by the ouput of the counter.  The
EPROM output is connected to a 7 segment LED readout, mounted in place of the
Sound Squelch pushbutton.  The readout indicates groups 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

   [Note: If I were to expand the memory in my PRO-2004,  I would use just the
new HM62256 memory IC and a BCD switch instead of the pushbutton.  This would
eliminate two of the three ICs, and the 7 segment readout.  Sorry, I cannot
provide further information, nor a reference, as the sheets sent to me
contained no name or address. - Bob

Another cellular mod

    In response to numerous inquiries I am posting a short overview of the 
mods to the Radio Shack PRO-2004 scanner. First, all mods are done at
your own risk. I assume no responsibility. I do not know what effect they
(the mods) will have on any warranty, however I would think they would
probably void it. Also, one of the mods restores coverage of the cellular
phone frequencies. 

These mods are detailed in the following articles:
a) POPULAR COMMUNICATIONS AUG 87, PP 18-20
b) MONITORING TIMES OCT 87, P 53
c) MONITORING TIMES DEC 87,P 60

I suggest strongly that you obtain the back issues and read through the letters
or articles. I also suggest you subscribe to the mags. They supply a lot of    
great info and freq lists. Now the mods.
 
1) Restoring 870 MHz coverage.
First treat the radio as if it were CMOS, that is make sure you and it have no
built up static charges. UNPLUG THE RADIO FROM THE AC OR DC POWER SOURCE AND
ANTENNA !!!!!!!! Take the radio out of the case by removing the 4 screws on 
the back. Carefully invert the radio. Locate a box-like sub-circuit. It's 
near the switch marked "restart". The sub-circuit should be marked PC-3.
Carefully pry off the cover of the metal box. Inside there will be a 64 pin dip
IC. This is the radio CPU. Be careful not to touch or short out any leads on
the chip. Near the chip there will be a row of diodes marked D-502 to D-515.
If D-513 is present, cut one lead, separate it so they will not touch, and 
magic, 870 Mhz is restored. If D-513 is not there and you still do not have
870 coverage, then a little more work is in order. Locate the 9 pin connector
"CN-501". Carefully remove it from the sub-circuit. Unscrew the screws holding
PC-3 to the main chassis. Carefully invert the sub-circuit board (PC-3).
Locate the one lone component on that side of the board. If it is a diode,
as it should be, then cut one lead and separate them as above. Re-install the
sub-circuit with the screws on to the main chassis. Reconnect the 9 pin 
connector. Do NOT put the cover back on just yet ?!  

                     2&3)   400 CHANNEL and SPEED MOD !
       On the top of the sub-circuit board, locate the slot for D-513. Count
backwards from there until you get to the space for D-510. Install a diode
at D-510 in the same polarity as the rest of the diodes. There, you now 
have 400 channels instead of 300 ! Now install a diode at D-514 and you have 
increased the scan speed to 20 channels/sec from 16 ch/sec. Carefully re-
assemble the metal box. Make sure everything else is as it should be.
RE-invert the radio so it is right side up. 
 
                        4)  THE SQUELCH MOD !!
    Now, locate a sub-circuit box under the sloping front panel. It should 
have many alignment holes in the top. Pry the cover off very carefully.
Locate IC-2 in the left side of the pc board. It should be marked IC-
10420. Locate R-148, a 47 K ohm resistor between pins 12 and 13. 
Cut a lead of this resistor, But be sure to leave enough lead on both
sides of the cut to solder to. Patch in a 100K ohm resistor. Make sure
there are no solder balls or short circuits. Now your squelch will operate
more smoothly.      
           
         Again, I STRONGLY suggest you obtain the above mentioned
magazines for more details. Addresses appear below. Please ignore any 
mis-spellings, mis grammer, etc. Good luck and good listening !!!


     Manufactured in Japan, by General Research Electronics,
     the  Radio  Shack  PRO-2004  is  a  300  channel,  wide
     coverage scanner radio, incorporating NBFM,  WBFM,  and
     AM modes.

     Although the catalog description doesn't do  the  radio
     justice, the microprocessor circuitry provides features
     not found in other scanners.

     This review, although admittedly subjective, focuses on
     three  broad characteristics:  feature set, basic elec-
     trical performance, and mechanical construction.


                       Frequency Coverage

     The PRO-2004 literature states that  coverage  is  from
     25-520  and  760-1300  MHz.   Radio Shack's last minute
     decision  to  remove   cellular   telephone   frequency
     coverage from the PRO-2004 caused a 7 week delay in its
     introduction.  A small card is  now  packed  with  each
     scanner,  informing  the  buyer that the radio will not
     operate in the 825-845 and 870-890 MHz ranges.

     A matrix of diodes, attached  to  the  microprocessor's
     input  port, is often used to configure radios for sale
     in different markets. From recent flux on  the  circuit
     board,  it appears that a diode has been added or remo-
     ved from my PRO-2004, and this may be how the  cellular
     telephone coverage was yanked.


                         Lots of Memory

     The PRO-2004 has the usual features that scanner  buffs
     have  come  to  expect:   individual  channel lockouts,
     selectable rescan delay, an external speaker jack, etc.
     But,  the  300 channel capacity of the PRO-2004 sets an
     industry record!  Casual scanner users may scoff at the
     usefulness  of  having  so  many channels, but seasoned
     monitorists can have those channels  filled  up  in  no
     time  flat,  especially  with  frequencies  in the vast
     225-400 MHz military air band.

     With so  many  channels  to  program,  one  dreads  the
     thought of a power failure, which could clear memory in
     a hurry.  Not to worry, the PRO-2004 memory  is  backed
     up  by a conventional 9 volt alkaline battery (not sup-
     plied).  The 300 channels are divided into 10 banks  of
     30  channels  each,  and one can select or deselect any
     channel bank from the scan list.   Individual  channels
     can  be  locked  out in the customary way, but the PRO-
     2004 provides a new feature, a LOCKOUT REVIEW.  Succes-
     sive  depressions  of  this key step through the locked
     out channels.

     The owner's manual refers to the ability  to  delete  a
     channel  by storing a 0 frequency in it, not a particu-
     larly useful exercise.  The scanner  will  still  spend
     time  scanning  a "deleted" channel unless it is locked
     out with the LOCKOUT key, which then means  it  appears
     in  the  lockout  list  when  using  the LOCKOUT REVIEW
     feature.

     Scanners worth their keep have a priority feature, with
     channel 1 usually designated the priority channel.  The
     PRO-2004 is more flexible; any of the 300 channels  may
     be  designated the priority channel.  When the PRIORITY
     key is depressed, that channel will be sampled every  2
     seconds,  and  the radio will stay there if a signal is
     heard.

     The PRO-2004 has two scan speeds,  although  one  would
     probably  use  the  faster,  16 channel/second speed in
     most  instances.   This  compares  favorably  with   14
     channel/second speed of the Bearcat 800XLT.

     When programming a channel, the PRO-2004 firmware  sets
     the  mode automatically, based on its idea of what mode
     is most prevalent  on  that  frequency.   This  feature
     saves  extra  keystrokes,  and makes one appreciate the
     thought that went into the design of this  radio.   The
     default mode can be overridden easily, if need be, like
     to listen to a NBFM satellite in the 225-400 MHz range,
     which is mainly populated with AM signals.



Misc mods

                            Searching

     The SEARCH facility found on most programmable scanners
     allows  the  entry  of  a  pair of frequencies, then by
     pressing a key, the radio searches frequencies  between
     those limits.  The PRO-2004 allows for 10 pairs of lim-
     its!  These pairs of limits are  stored  in  their  own
     memory,  and  don't  use up any of the conventional 300
     memory channels.  One can set up several search  pairs,
     for instance:

        - 46.610-46.970 MHz: cordless telephones
        - 144-148 MHz: the 2 meter ham band
        - 30.01-30.56, 32-33, 36-37 MHz: US Govt

     Another unique feature is the MONITOR key, which  stops
     the  search  and  stores  the  frequency  in one of ten
     special monitor memories.  These memories are  separate
     from  the  300 main memory channels.  The search can be
     restarted from where it left off by striking the up  or
     down arrow key.

     The user can select the search direction (up or  down),
     and  step size of 5, 12.5, or 50 KHz, although the PRO-
     2004 is intelligent enough to  select  a  default  step
     size  based  on  the  frequencies  being searched.  The
     owner's manual claims that a step size  of  30  KHz  is
     also available, but apparently this step size was disa-
     bled when the cellular telephone frequency coverage was
     removed.

     The selected parameters are displayed on the LCD panel.
     Search  speed is switchable between slow and fast, with
     fast search being about 14 increments/second (versus 12
     for  the  800XLT).   For  a  12.5  KHz  increment, this
     translates to 11.2 MHz/minute  (versus  9.6  MHz/minute
     for the 800XLT).

     The DIRECT key allows one to start searching up or down
     from  whatever  frequency is on the display.  Let's say
     the scanner is in MANUAL mode, and set at  channel  26,
     which  contains  460.100 MHz.  Striking the DIRECT then
     UP-ARROW keys starts  the  PRO-2004  searching  upwards
     from 460.100.  This is a nice feature.

     The  PRO-2004 contains  a  "window  detector"  circuit,
     which  is  called  into play during a SEARCH operation.
     This circuit tries to detect when the  radio  is  tuned
     close  to  the  center  frequency  of  a  station,  and
     prevents the search from halting  prematurely,  off  to
     the side of the signal.

     The AFC (automatic frequency control)  circuit  of  the
     Bearcat 800XLT often causes a search of 850 MHz signals
     to halt prematurely.  Even though the signal sounds  on
     frequency,  the display reads the wrong frequency.  The
     PRO-2004 does not have this problem.

     Another interesting feature is the SOUND SQUELCH, which
     may be used during scan or search operations.  With the
     the sound squelch enabled,  signified  by  a  red  lamp
     above  the pushbutton, the scanner will skip over unmo-
     dulated signals.  This is handy for skipping over "bir-
     dies", or link signals with a constant carrier.

     According to the owner's manual:

        -  "When the PRO-2004 stops at a frequency which has
          no  sound,  it  remains there for 0.5 seconds, and
          then goes to the next frequency if"  no  sound  is
          detected "within that time."

           "When  a  frequency  which  contains   sound   is
          received, it halts at the frequency.  But,

            a.  If the sound ceases during the reception, it
                stays  on  the  frequency for 5 seconds, and
                resumes scanning."

            b.   "If the [station] stops sending a  carrier,
                the unit reverts to scan [or search] immedi-
                ately if DELAY is off, after 2  seconds,  if
                the DELAY is active."

     The manual warns that the sound squelch may  be  fooled
     by  signals  with  low  modulation, and skip over them.
     The PRO-2004 SOUND SQUELCH tries to detect the presence
     or  absence of modulation (not human speech), so unfor-
     tunately, it thinks that mobile phone idle tones, digi-
     tal data signals, and paging tones are worth monitoring
     and will stop the scanner to listen to them.


                         Taping Facility

     A tape recorder can be connected to the TAPE phono jack
     on  the rear panel, which provides 600 mV of audio at a
     10,000 ohm impedance.  In addition to  a  rear  mounted
     external speaker jack, there is a headphone jack on the
     front of the scanner.


                        Basic Performance

     To evaluate sensitivity, the $400 PRO-2004 was compared
     with  a  $950  ICOM  R7000  and  a  $300 UNIDEN/Bearcat
     800XLT.  Since a signal generator was not used, quanti-
     tative   measurements  could  not  be  made.   Instead,
     various antennas were switched between radios,  signals
     from  stations  were  compared  by ear, and the results
     tabulated.

     Simply put, the PRO-2004 is sensitive enough  to  allow
     one  to  hear what needs to be heard, and not so sensi-
     tive as to be overloaded by  strong  signals.   On  850
     MHz,  signals  were  readable  on  the  PRO-2004  which
     couldn't even be detected on the R7000.

     Although the 800XLT is the most sensitive radio of  the
     three  tested, it suffers from images and overload much
     more than the PRO-2004 or R7000.  The PRO-2004 has a 10
     dB  attenuator, operable by a slide switch on the rear,
     but its use has been unnecessary thus far.

     The up conversion design of both  the  ICOM  and  Radio
     Shack  units allows use of a very high IF (intermediate
     frequency), which  helps  avoid  image  problems.   The
     PRO-2004 owner's manual doesn't list the IF frequencies
     directly, but a good guess is that the  first  two  IFs
     are 610 MHz, 70 MHz.  The third IF looks something like
     455 KHz when using AM or NBFM,  and  perhaps  10.7  MHz
     when the WBFM mode is selected.

     The PRO-2004 is slightly more selective  on  NBFM  than
     the  800XLT.   WBFM selectivity is rated at about twice
     as wide as the ICOM R7000.

     The audio output quality is good, although it seems  to
     lack  the  punch  of the 800XLT audio.  The top mounted
     speaker directs the sound at the ceiling, but adding an
     external  speaker  would allow the sound to be directed
     at the user.

     Unfortunately,  the  audio  level  of  AM  signals   is
     somewhat  below  that of NBFM signals, requiring a dif-
     ferent setting of the volume  control.   When  scanning
     both  AM  and  NBFM modes, one has to find a compromise
     position of the volume control.

     The PRO-2004 squelch control has a bit  too  much  hys-
     teresis,  a  trait  inherited from its ancestors.  It's
     like having too much play in a car's steering wheel, or
     backlash  in a gear set.  This hysteresis forces one to
     keep the squelch at a tighter setting,  missing  weaker
     signals when scanning or searching.  The Bearcat 800XLT
     has this trait also,  but  the  fix  is  simple.   I've
     successfully  eliminated  this  problem  completely  by
     replacing  a  single resistor on the 800XLT, as well as
     the PRO-2002, PRO-2003, and PRO-24 scanners.


                     Mechanical Construction

     The PRO-2004 is heavy.   It  is  enclosed  in  a  metal
     cabinet,  but  has  a  plastic  front panel.  If one is
     going to pay $400, one deserves to own some metal.  The
     entirely  plastic  cabinet of the older PRO2003 allowed
     wideband noise to radiate out of the scanner  and  into
     nearby shortwave receivers.

     There is a single BNC antenna connector on the rear  of
     the  PRO-2004, and a single telescoping antenna is sup-
     plied.  This  differs  from  the  800XLT  which  has  2
     "Motorola  type"  antenna  connectors, one reserved for
     the 800 MHz band.

     Internal construction is excellent.   Most  stages  are
     completely  enclosed  in  their own individual shielded
     boxes.  Interstage shielding is  very  important  in  a
     wide   band  receiver,  to  prevent  it  from  "hearing
     itself", an  undesirable  phenomena  which  results  in
     "birdies".2 The shielding is much better  in  the  PRO-
     2004 than in the 800XLT, which uses no shielding around
     the 800 MHz converter stage, and probably accounts  for
     some of the birdies in the Bearcat.

     Frequencies and other indicators  are  displayed  on  a
     backlit  LCD  (liquid  crystal  display) panel, and the
     level of backlighting can be  dimmed  by  a  pushbutton
     switch.

     The flat membrane  keyboard  has  a  nice  feel.   Only
     slight  pressure  is  required  for  actuation, and key
     depressions are confirmed by a mild "beep" audio tone.

     The PRO-2004 might be too large to fit under the  dash-
     board  of compact cars.  Although it can be operated on
     12 VDC,  neither  a  mobile  power  cord  nor  mounting
     bracket  are  provided.  These items were included with
     earlier Radio Shack models.  The AC power cord  is  not
     detachable,  and would have to be bundled up to keep it
     out of the way in a mobile installation.



                         Owner's Manual

     The  user  manual  suffers  from  Japanese  to  English
     translation  problems,  but  is fairly good, resembling
     other Radio Shack scanner manuals.

     A single page frequency allocations chart is  included,
     but  is  not current.  There is a very simplified block
     diagram, but no  schematic.   The  Maintenance  section
     contains  a  useless troubleshooting chart, accompanied
     by advice like "keep it dry" and "do not drop".  Thank-
     fully,  detailed  service manuals for Radio Shack scan-
     ners are usually available for $5.00 or $7.50.

     The PRO-2004 is warranted for 1 year,  which  is  reas-
     suring.


                         What's Missing?

     So with all these neat features,  what's  missing  from
     the  PRO-2004?  A "search and store" mode, like that on
     the ICOM R7000 and older Bearcat 250  would  have  been
     nice.   A  lighted keyboard and a signal strength meter
     would also be welcome.

     Having a COR (carrier operated relay) output, like ICOM
     R7000  and  old  Bearcat  250 have, would be useful for
     actuating a tape recorder.


                             Summary

     If all one wants is a scanner to monitor  local  police
     and  fire,  there  are  certainly  cheaper  and simpler
     models than the PRO-2004.  This scanner  is  for  those
     who  enjoy  actively  exploring voice communications in
     the VHF/UHF spectrum.

     The PRO-2004 has the right  features  and  performance,
     especially  for  scanning the wide 225-400 MHz military
     aircraft band.  Good design should not to be taken  for
     granted.  GRE engineers used the power of the micropro-
     cessor to implement useful features  in  the  PRO-2004.

     Similar processing horsepower was not used so wisely in
     a recent Yaesu scanner.

     At about $400, the PRO-2004 provides a good alternative
     to those not wishing to spend $950 for an ICOM R7000.

<h3>Still Another Cellular Mod.</h3>

The PRO-2004 scanner can be used to receive cellular telephone
conversations.  Originally, the scanner was able to receive in this
band, but at the last minute, it was decided to delete cellular
coverage from the PRO-2004.

The procedure to re-instate the cellular band is simple for anyone
with a pair of cutters, and a phillips screw-driver.

1.  Remove the four screws from the back of the radio, and slide
off the cover from the chassis.

2.  Turn the radio upside down.  You will find a metal box-like sub-
chassis in the center of the main chassis.  Remove the cover and
you will be looking at the CPU, a 64-pin integrated circuit.

3.  Examine the component side of this board, and you will find a row of
diodes and resistors.  On one end of the row you will find a diode
labeled  D-513.

4.  Clip the accessible end of D-513, and pry apart the ends so they
don't touch.  You have just restored cellular coverage to you scanner.

5.  If D-513 is not there, it may be located on the underside of
the circuit board.
