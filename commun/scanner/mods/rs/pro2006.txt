To enable the Radio Shack PRO-2006 scanner to monitor the cellular phone
frequencies (870.030-879.360 System A Base) (880.650-889.980 System B Base)
and the actual mobile telephone frequency (825.030-834.360 System A Mobile)
and (835.650-844.980 System B Mobile) do the following:

1. Remove the top cover only. It is held by the 2 screws on back.

2. Looking behind the metal plate covering the front panel, look at your
   left top corner. You will see 2 glass diodes sticking out of the PC
   board (PC-3). The one at the bottom is labeled D502.

3. Simply cut the lead on the diode (D502).

Turn the radio on and program the limit search memories with the ranges
indicated on top. The System A and B Base are the ones to listen to. The
reason is that you'll be able to hear both sides of the conversation. If
you try listening the Mobile signal, you'll only hear the signal being sent
out by the actual phone. Also the signal on the cellular phone is only a
measly 4 watts.

This mod is so simple, you can do it in less than 3 minutes. Only a small
cutting plier is needed, as well as the screwdriver.

This information is intended for BBS users outside the USA. Since the US
has a really dumb law called the E.C.P.A (Electronics Communications Privacy
Act), it basically prohibits listening in on a variety of radio signals
which are not intended to be listened by the general public and has been
deliberately encoded, scrambled, or just deliberately used to ensure
privacy. So, if you live in the US, don't do this mod.

Radio Shack PRO-2006 Scanner Mods
by Mark A. Day  N4OQK @ CHO

Introduction

The PRO-2006 is probably the worlds most versatile scanner to date.
Modifications are easily implemented, and upgrade performance over stock
units tremendously. Enjoy, and keep scanning!


Mod#1 : Cellular restoration
Parts : NONE

        To restore the missing CMT frequencies, merely clip diode D502.
        It is located in the upper left corner of the CPU/display board.


Mod#2 : Scan rate increase
Parts : 16Mhz. Quartz Crystal - fundamental cut

        Replace CX503 (12Mhz) with a 16Mhz crystal, clip diode D503 (near D502)
        The unit now scans at around 40 channels per second.


Mod#3 : Squelch hysteresis suppression
Parts : 100-200K ohm 1/8w resistor

        Locate R152 (33K) on the linear PCB (main board). This is a tricky
        resistor to get to, since it is on the bottom side of the board.
        Remove this resistor, and replace it with a 100-200K resistor. The
        higher the resistance, the less hysteresis will be present. I found
        100K gave me all the razor-sharpness I was looking for, without
        sacrificing performance.


Mod#4 : "S" meter output
Parts : 10Kohm 1/8w resistor, 0.1 uf capacitor

        Locate D33 on the linear PCB. Solder in the 10K resistor to the ANODE
        of this diode. Note this is not the same as TP2. Connect a wire from
        the free end of this resistor to a rear panel jack (RCA). Solder the
        0.1uf capacitor from the jack's center terminal to ground. Output on
        this jack follows the AGC voltage. Negative for no signal, goes
        positive when a signal is present, increasing with signal strength.
        A 1Volt full scale panel meter makes a good "S" meter


Mod#5 : Increased headphone audio
Parts : NONE

        Locate resistor R228 (27 ohm) on linear board (near IC7).
        Remove this resistor and replace it with a jumper wire.


    
PRO2006.2

Mod#6 : 6400 channel memory capacity (ADVANCED TECHNICIANS ONLY!)
Parts : Hitachi HM62256LFP-12 (256Kx8 SRAM) or equivalent (flat pack required)
        4 Position DIPswitch
        10KOhm resistor SIP  (or 4 10K 1/8w resistors)

        This modification is complicated, so don't try it if you're not fully
        sure of youre ability.


        1) Remove front panel from scanner, disconnect wiring harnesses.
           You will lose all current programs (Sorry!)

        2) Remove metal shield from panel CAREFULLY!
           Remove screws holding CPU board in front panel.
           Carefully separate CPU board from keyboard.

        3) Locate IC505 next to CPU and remove it from the board.
           Notice this is a 24pin IC, and that there are 4 extra pads
           to the top of pin 1. All pin numbers given hereafter will
           refer to the new 28 pin IC, with pin 4 being the old IC's
           pin 1. Follow me? The pads for the new IC are already present.

        4) To adapt to the new RAM, a few traces must be sliced.

           A) Slice the trace connecting pin 28 to pin 26
           B) Slice trace connecting pin 27 to pin 23 (bottom of board)
           C) Slice trace connecting pin 2 to ground (bottom of board)

        5) Install the new RAM, and connect a jumper from CPU IC501
           pin 67 (+5V) to pin 28 of the new RAM.

        6) To address the extended memory, external switches must be added
           and connected to the unused address lines of the new RAM.
           Just how you implement this is up to you. Regardless of how you
           do it, you will need to connect a wire bundle from the new RAM
           pins 1,2,23,26 to the outside world. I mounted a jack on the rear
           panel into which a 4 position dipswitch can be mounted.

        7) Add pullup resistors from new address lines to +5V, available at
           pin 3 of the +5V regulator IC8.

        8) Reassemble unit, installing all shields and ground straps.

        9) Testing & checkout

           A) With all switches 'OFF' enter '1000.000' into memory channel 1.
           B) Toggle switch 1 to on and return to channel 1. Enter '1001.000'
           C) Repeat for all switch combinations. Lockout channel 1 in each
              of the 16 memory blocks. You now have a coded channel to key
              you in on which block you're scanning.
           D) Enjoy 6400 channels of pure scanning power!


        You now have:

            16 Blocks of 400 memory channels per block
           160 Search ranges (10 per block)
           160 Temporary scratchpad channels (10 per block)

        Notice that custom settings (delay/mode) are unique to EACH
        channel, but priority and speed are common to all blocks.
        You might dedicate a common channel in each block to be the
        priority channel

                   Pro-2006 Modifications

Note: The Electronics Communcations Privacy Acot of 1986 makes
it unlawful to monitor mobile telephones, including Cellular.
The Following modification is intended only to restore contin-
uous 760-1300 MHz coverage as originally provided by the design
of the PRO-2006 Microprocessor.

         824-851, 869-896 MHz Freq Restoration :

Tools Requires: small phillips screwdriver, small wire cutters.

Procedure: With power cord unplugged, remove the two rear cab-
inet screws holding the upper cover.  Lift off the upper cover,
being careful not to stretch the speaker leads. Examine the  
inner, right-hand-corner of the front panel to find two glass
diodes, labelled D503 (upper diode) and D502 (lower diode).

Using the clippers, very carefully snip the visible lead of the
lower diode (D 502) at its bend and slightly separate the cut
ends.

Reassemble, plug in AC cord, turn on scanner, and Press RESET.


                    Keyboard Beep Delete

With the top cover off as described above,  locate connectors
CN3, a 15-pin connector with colored wires at the front of the
main circuit board.  There are two procedures which will stop
the beep tone from being heard through the speaker; read both
to decide which procedure you want to follow.

(1) Find the center gray wire coming from CN3 and cut it midway
to disable the beep tone. You may wish to solder a resistor in 
series to reduce the beep volume, a trimpot tovary the volume 
of beep tone, or a miniature switch to choose between beep and
No beep .....!

(2) Using a pair of needle-nose pliers, CAREFULLY pry the plug
from CN3, revealing a row of pins. Locate the center pin ( #8 )
which corresponds to the gray wire and bend it down flat, dis-
abling the beep ........

This is a great scanner.  Have fun with it. 73's KA4NMX...
