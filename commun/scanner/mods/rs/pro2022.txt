
  Realistic PRO-2022 200 Channel Scanner
  --------------------------------------

 Modification to access 868-896Mhz band
               by N6VMO
           Version 12.30.91
This modification may be ILLEGAL for use
within the U.S., and will void the
warranty of the scanner if mod is detected
by Radio Shack servicing centers. Desoldering
of components is recommmended over snipping
component leads.

Purpose of Modification:

To gain access to the celluar base frequencies
from 868 to 896Mhz. Monitoring this band will
enable a listener to hear both sides of a
cellular phone communication.

Modification History:                                                                                                                                           After purchasing the PRO-2022, I downloaded
several scanner mod files and learned how
Radio Shack matrix'ed out certain portions
of the spectrum. Opening the PRO-2022 case
reveled the PRO-2022 'mystery'.

Modificatiion Procedure:

1. Remove power,antenna, and ext. speaker
   from scanner rear panel.

2. Remove top and bottom covers by removing
   the 4 screws on the rear panel. Unplug speaker.

3. Remove the large RFI metal sheild from
   the bottom circuit board.

4. Desolder anode side of D44 from circuit
   board, and ensure lead is isolated from
   any circuit board connections. Desoldering
   D44 will allow you to return the unit to
   its original condition if RS service is
   required.

4a. I believe that desoldering D43 will allow
    access to the mobile portion of the cell-
    ular band (823-851Mhz). I have not tried
    D43 mod.

5. Resolder RFI sheild in place, install covers.


I also believe that adding diodes in D42 and D45
positions will grant other neat features such as:

 1. Faster scan time
 2. Access to 200Mhz portions of the spectrum.

Experiment and drop me a packet on what you find.
