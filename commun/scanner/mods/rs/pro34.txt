                 "NOVICE NOTES" FOR PRO-34 MODIFICATIONS
 

1.  Remove the 4 small phillips scres on the back of the unit

2.  Remove the batter cover and battery holder from the case.

3.  Remove the two knobs on the top of the case (Volume &  Squelch)

4.  The Case has some pressure fit points, These are at the bottom of
    the case and you need to be a bit careful in forcing the two halves
    of the case shell appart. Once you have the pressure fit points 
    at the bottom released, angle up the bottom of the case until
    the battery sepperation wall is clear of the internal metal frame,
    and slide towards the top of the unit, place the back half of the
    shell aside.

                   PRO-34 BIRDIE ELIMINATED

                     by Bob Parnass, AJ9S

   Birdies are unwanted signals generated within a receiver,
   which  cause the receiver to "hear itself."  Some birdies
   are caused by the unwanted product of the local  oscilla-
   tor.   Another  cause  is  a  stage, which oscillates but
   isn't meant to oscillate, such as a high gain  intermedi-
   ate frequency (IF) amplifier.

   Most birdies,  especially  those  generated  by  a  local
   oscillator,  are frequency stable.  It's difficult to rid
   a radio of these birdies, and solutions  usually  involve
   better internal shielding and isolation among the stages.

   A "wandering birdie"  is  one  which  changes  frequency.
   Wandering birdies, and birdies which appear and disappear
   suddenly, may be caused by  intermittent  ground  connec-
   tions within the radio, or defective bypass capacitors.

 
Restoration of Cellular Frequency Coverage on
Radio Shack PRO-34 Handheld Scanner
 
1.  Remove battery cover and battery, four black screws on
        rear cover, and volume and squelch knobs.

2.  Remove rear cover, lifting back and up to clear controls.
        Do not remove belt clip or circuit board screws.

3.  Unplug the brown volume control connector (grn/yel/blk)
        and white squelch control connector (wht/blk/red) from
        the linear circuit board.

4.  Unsolder the ground lead from T111 (at corner of linear
        circuit board above the external power connectors).
        Unsolder the two power switch leads from the back of
        the volume control.  Unsolder the antenna connector
        center pin and ground wires from the linear circuit board.

5.  Unscrew the four combination screws that hold the linear
        circuit board and received the back cover screws.
        Grasp the linear board at the top and lift it straight away
        from the front case, unplugging the 16-pin connector.

6.  Remove the three screws holding the metal frame assembly which
        held the linear board to the front panel.  Unplug the
        red-black power lead and lay the frame aside.  It is still
        connected to the battery contacts.

7.  Locate diodes D9 - D12 on the volume control side of the of
        the logic circuit board under T1; D10 and D11 are marked.
        Clip one lead of D11, separating the gap.  This may be
        resoldered later if desired.

8.  Reassemble the board by reversing the disassembly procedures above.

Thanks to Robert Kelty, Larry Wiland, and Monitoring Times Magazine
(Dec 1988 issue)
 

5.  Now you will see the RF boad mounted to the metal support frame, The 
    BNC (antenna) conector leads and the volume control power switch leads
    are soldered directly to the board. Carefully desolder these 4 connections.

6.  At the bottom of the RF board there is a IF Can transformer that has a small
    wire as a groundign strap soldered directly to it. Desolder this as well.

7.  There will be some wires from the volume controle knob to the PC board that
    are socketed. Remove the plug from the ~F board (needle nose pliers work)

8.  There will also be a similar wire (small sheilded ) from the squelch control
    to the RF board wich is also Socketed. Remove the plug from the RF board.
    (Again Needle Nose Pliers work good here)

9.  Remove the 4 thredded stand-offs from the RF Board (these Hold the RF board to
    the internal mettal frame and are where the screws that hold the back of the
    case on go.) Use a nut driver or Needle Nose Pliers.

13. There is a small socketed wire that leads from the small power pc board on the
    metal frame that goes under it and is pluged into the Logic board. Lift
    the metal frame up and remove the power plug from the PC board. Place the 
    metal frame with|the rest of your parts pile.

14. You are have the component side of the  Logig board exposed now. There are
    2 small phillips screws at the bottom of the PC board (where the Battery 
    compartment WAS) Remove them.

15. Once you have the the last 2 screw removed the Logic board is free. The
    speaker wires lead from the speaker to the logic board on the bottom side.
    These are soldered in but there is enough play in them to allow you to
    make the mods.


16. NOTE: The keyboard lock switch is a funky little piece of plastic with
    a sliding stainless metal contactor that is just wedged inbetween the
    front case and the logic board. Remove both the switch contacts and the
    plastic switch. (best know it now or loose them in the carpet)

18. You must now move diode D11 to the place where D9 is labled. As you have
    probably noticed by now there is a tin cover over about 1/2rd of the PC
    boards solder side. The edge of the tin cover nearest the diodes has 2
    metal tabs soldered to the P board. Desolder these 2 tabs and gently bend
    the metal cover way from the soder side of the PC board. This will expose
    the board enough to let you get your soldering iron in to where the diode
    leads are.

19. Desolder the D11 diode from the bottom while pulling it away from the
    board on the top  of the board using neadle nose pliers on the LEAD only.

20. Now heat up the D9 solder pads and insert the diode (the same way it was
    oriented in the D11 location) You Have Completed the Mods for complete
    800mhz band coverage and 66-88mhz band coverage. Follow the same steps
    backwards (20->1)and replace "remove" with "replace" and "desolder" with
    "solder"

LASTLY, Now that you have made the mods, you can use the warranty card to
light the Bar-B-Q Grill with.

Subject: PRO-34 Scanner Modifications

    In  the  May 1989  edition  of  Popular  Communications  is a
"Letter  to the Editor" on the Radio Shack PRO-34 Scanner.  Below
is the text of that letter.


                  PRO-34 Scanner Modification

    In regard to the information  presented (March Issue)  on the
handheld Radio Shack PRO-34 scanner,  my own observations  on the
modifications have been:

1. To restore missing 800 MHz frequencies, remove D-11.

2. To add 66 to 88 MHz  (European Coverage),  install a diode at
   D-9.

3. D-10 must remain in place for full 800 MHz coverage.

4. If a diode is added at D-13 it cuts out aero band, also seems
   to affect 800 MHz channel spacing.

5. D-12 added dosen't seem to have any affect.

6. Only D-10 and D-11 are factory installed.

    I  wish to thank you  for a fine and informative  magazine. I
have had much reading enjoyment.

   "wandering birdie."  Ron's scanner  was hearing  itself on a few
   frequencies in the VHF-Hi range, but the birdie disappeared when he
   tilted  the  radio  or squeezed  the  case.   There had been no
   problem when the scanner was purchased initially.

Subject: PRO-34 Novice Notes (mods)



  Yesterday afternoon I received the mods instructions for the Pro-34 scanner

to add complete 800mhz and 66-88 mhz coverage. I was so excited that I 

started dissassembling the beast at my office with the tools at hand. One of the

tools NOT at hand was a soldering iron and for lack of a lighter and a sewing 

needle I postponed the completion of the mods until I got home. Once completed

I verified previous operation and then checked to see that the mods worked. Yup

I am much pleased with the results.  I would like to thank Sam Jones for his 

original Mods instructions.



  The Following instructions are a result of a request for the coverage mods for

the PRO-34 scanner. I made the assumption that the requester had never opened up

their scaner before. 

  The instructions below are for those that don't like to completely dissassemble

every new electronic toy they buy just to see how it works. Nor is it for the

guy that has been building their own equipment since the days of the first 

tube diode. This set of instructions assums a moderate level of skill with a 

soldering iron, and some simple hand tools. It is aimed at those who just want

the additional coverage from the mods but havn't been building kits for a decade.

 lets just call these ....



                 "NOVICE NOTES" FOR PRO-34 MODIFICATIONS

 



1.  Remove the 4 small phillips scres on the back of the unit



2.  Remove the batter cover and battery holder from the case.



3.  Remove the two knobs on the top of the case (Volume &  Squelch)



4.  The Case has some pressure fit points, These are at the bottom of

    the case and you need to be a bit careful in forcing the two halves

    to the RF board wich is also Socketed. Remove the plug from the RF board.

    (Again Needle Nose Pliers work good here)



9.  Remove the 4 thredded stand-offs from the RF Board (these Hold the RF board to

    the internal mettal frame and are where the screws that hold the back of the

    case on go.) Use a nut driver or Needle Nose Pliers.

 



10. Now there the RF board is mostly free. The only thing holding it in is the row

    of connector pins on its botom side that plug into the logic board. You will

    need to pry this board up gently. Be warned that the bottom side of the RF

    vertically. These will be labeled on the PC board as D10 and D11, you will

    also see a place for another diaode to be soldered in but was not 

    installed at the factory.. this is D9.



18. You must now move diode D11 to the place where D9 is labled. As you have

    probably noticed by now there is a tin cover over about 1/2rd of the

    PC boards solder side. The edge of the tin cover nearest the diodes has

    2 metal tabs soldered to the PC board. Desolder these 2 tabs and gently

    bend the metal cover way from the soder side of the PC board. This will

    expose the board enough to let you get your soldering iron in to where

    the diode leads are.



19. Desolder the D11 diode from the bottom while pulling it away from the board

    on the top  of the board using neadle nose pliers on the LEAD only.



20. Now heat up the D9 solder pads and insert the diode (the same way it was 

    oriented in the D11 location)



You Have Completed the Mods for complete 800mhz band coverage and 66-88mhz band

coverage.



Follow the same steps backwards (20->1)and replace "remove" with "replace"

and "desolder" with "solder"



N.B. These instructions are from last night, All the steps are in correct order

as well as the general information. The diagrams are from memory so components

may not be in the exact location indicated, but they will be very close.



LASTLY, Now that you have made the mods, you can use the warranty card to

light the Bar-B-Q Grill with.

Subject: PRO-34 Scanner Modifications



    In  the  May 1989  edition  of  Popular  Communications  is a

"Letter  to the Editor" on the Radio Shack PRO-34 Scanner.  Below

is the text of that letter.





                  PRO-34 Scanner Modification



    In regard to the information  presented (March Issue)  on the

handheld Radio Shack PRO-34 scanner,  my own observations  on the

modifications have been:



1. To restore missing 800 MHz frequencies, remove D-11.



2. To add 66 to 88 MHz  (European Coverage),  install a diode at

   D-9.



3. D-10 must remain in place for full 800 MHz coverage.



4. If a diode is added at D-13 it cuts out aero band, also seems

   to affect 800 MHz channel spacing.



5. D-12 added dosen't seem to have any affect.



6. Only D-10 and D-11 are factory installed.



    I  wish to thank you  for a fine and informative  magazine. I

have had much reading enjoyment.



                             Sam S. Jones,

                             Rebel Antenna,

                             Falls Church, VA
