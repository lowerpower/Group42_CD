<h3><A NAME="SSYL4">4 Digit Spanish YL</A></h3>
This is a fairly commonly heard format, though not as often heard as the 
five digit variety. The transmission starts with a three digit block 
repeated three times, followed by a count, such as "376 376 376 
1234567890". This is sent for several minutes, and is followed by a 
series of tones. Then the number of message blocks to be sent is give, 
for example "grupo 87". Then the four digit message blocks begin. The 
message is terminated with "fin". 

Four digit numbers stations generally have excellent technical quality. 
They may be the "real" messages (as opposed to training exercises), or 
just run by better funded spies!

<h3><A NAME="SSYL5">5 Digit Spanish YL</A></h3>  
This is by far the most commonly heard type of numbers station in North 
America. A typical transmission starts with "atencion", then a three digit
block and a two digit block, such as "atencion 932 86". The two digit block
is always the number of five digit groups later sent as the message. The 
three digit block is believed to be the recipient. This preamble is sent 
for several minutes, and then the actual message is sent, as a series of 
five digit blocks. The transmission ends with the words "final, final". 

AM modulation is sometimes used, although SSB is also reported. I have 
heard many stations which seem to be using <i>reduced carrier 
sideband</i>, with modulation on one of the sidebands, and a lower power 
carrier, sufficient for reception on AM receivers. 

These transmissions often have technical problems (poor audio, hum, 
distortion, sometimes big "accidents" like starting to play the Radio 
Habana opening music!

<h3><A NAME="EEYL4">4 Digit English YL</A></h3>  
These transmissions start with a three digit block (presumed to be the          
recipient number repeated for several minutes. No message length is sent. 
A 1234567890 count is then heard, often followed by some tones. Then the 
five digit message blocks begin.

<h3><A NAME="EEYL5">5 Digit English YL</A></h3>
These transmissions start with a three digit block (presumed to be the 
recipient number repeated for several minutes. No message length is sent. 
Then the five digit message blocks begin.

The accent of the female announcers of the five digit stations often 
varies. Some are distinctly Britsh, some Spanish, others sound American. 
This may indicate that there are several organizations operating the 
various stations. Or, as with many "facts" about Numbers Stations, it may 
mean nothing at all!

<h3><A NAME="Poacher">Lincolnshire Poacher 5 Digit English YL</A></h3>    
This is a variation of the five digit English station. The tune 
"Lincolnshire Poacher" (which sounds like "Pop Goes The Weasel" is played 
at the beginning of the transmission. This station is most often heard in 
Europe and the eastern part of North America. I have often heard it being 
jammed.

<hr>

<h3><A NAME="EEYL32">3/2 Digit English YL</a></h3>
These transmissions are very similar to the five digit transmissions, 
except that a distinct pause is heard between the third and fourth digits 
of each message block. It is not known if this signifies a different
encryption system than used in the five digit transmissions. 

<hr>

<h3><A NAME="GGYL4">5 Digit German YL</a></h3>
Similar to the five digit German stations described below. Rarely heard 
(at least in North America).
<hr>

<h3><A NAME="GGYL5">5 Digit German YL</a></h3>
These transmissions often open with tones or some sort of music. 
Sometimes, a two letter phoentic phrase is heard, such as "Papa Romeo". 
The preamble opens with "achtung" and a three digit block, generally 
presumed to be the recipient. (Perhaps it is really the number of the one 
time pad to be used to decode the message, and the two letter phonetic 
sent at the beginning is the recipient. This makes sense to me because 
the agents would listen at the beginning of the transmission to see if 
the message is for them.) This is followed by "gruppen" and the number of 
message blocks to follow. The message closes with "ende".

Commonly heard in Europe, and North America. This would tend to indicate 
a European transmission site. Indeed, several years ago, transmissions 
were DFed to a then East German location.

<h3><A NAME="Phonetic3">3 Letter Phonetic (Mossad)</a></h3>
A female voice is used to repeat a three letter phonetic phrase (followed 
by a number), such as "Papa November Oscar Two". This can go on for hours 
before a message is sent. The message is generally blocks of phonetic 
letters.

It is believed that Mossad (the Israel Intelligence Service) operates 
these stations, and they are often referred to as Mossad transmissions.
