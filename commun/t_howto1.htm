<A NAME="TAP"></A>
<STRONG>HOW TO TAP A TELEPHONE</STRONG><BR><P>
Ok, there are only about 18 different ways to tap a telephone. We'll speak
about the most basic way today. The most basic is the telephone company
lineman's handset.  You know, the thing the repairman hooks into your wiring
to check if you have dial-tone. These devices are common and can be bought at
just about any telephone supply outlet.  To show you how it's used, let's
experiment with your home telephone. Take the cover off the RJ-11 box and
inspect the wiring. You should see four wires, red, green, yellow and black.
Attach one alligator clip from the handset to the red wire and the other
alligator clip to the green wire. Throw the switch on the handset to dial
tone and you should hear dial tone through the handset. Dial up a friend and
talk. Ok, it works.<P>
Now, you have just tapped into your own telephone line. You can do the same
procedure outside your residence to your phone line anywhere between the
telephone instrument itself and the central office. By switching the handset
to monitor, you can silently monitor all traffic on your telephone line. A
telephone company handset in the monitor mode is practically impossible to
detect electronically on the telephone line. This procedure can be duplicated
on ANY telephone line to provide free (and illegal) telephone service or to
monitor (illegally) any target telephone line. Have fun.<P>
Future issues of the Codex will describe in-depth ALL known ways to intercept
telephone conversation. This data is provided for informational purposes
only.<P>

<A NAME="BUG"></A>
<STRONG>HOW TO BUG A ROOM</STRONG><P>
Yep, that's right. There are countless ways to bug a room. You can plant
hardwired microphones, radio bugs, contact microphones, tape recorders, etc.
Today we'll speak about a basic inexpensive hardwired microphone
installation. If you're not that handy, run down to your neighborhood Radio
Shack and purchase an inexpensive amplified speaker and a small tape recorder
type microphone. It should cost you no more than about $25 dollars. Let's
assume you want to bug the spare bedroom in your home. <P>
Run the microphone into the target room and hide it well. Run the cable into
the adjacent room or whatever room you desire to be your listening post. Use
extra cable if necessary. Plug the microphone into the microphone jack on the
amplified speaker and turn the speaker on. You should hear all sounds in the
target room quite clearly. If you desire you can plug the amplified speaker
into a Vox operated tape recorder and set the threshold to start only when
there is conversation in the room. <P>
This method has one big drawback. If discovered, the microphone cable can be
traced back to the listening post but on the plus side it won't be detected
during a TSCM sweep unless discovered physically or unless the technician is
using a non-linear junction detector.<P>
In future editions of The Codex we'll discuss ALL known ways to bug a room.<P>

<A NAME="CELL"></A>
<STRONG>HOW TO INTERCEPT A CELLULAR TELEPHONE CONVERSATION</STRONG><P>
I once had an acquaintance tell me he was not worried about having his phone
tapped. I asked why and he told me he had a cellular phone. "How could they
hook up a tap to a wireless phone?' Not everyone is so stupid. <P>
Cellular telephones are very easy (and Illegal) to monitor. All you generally
need is a modified (to pick up the 800-900Mhz band) scanner. Simply turn the
scanner on and program the search function to search in between the 800-900
mhz band in 30 Khz spacing. Pretty soon you'll be listening to all types of
conversations. <P>
You can improve reception by using an antenna that is tuned to the cellular
band or using an amplified antenna. One problem that you will encounter in
cellular telephone monitoring is loss of conversation due to the target
cellular telephone moving from cell to cell. There are various techniques to
overcome this  problem which will be discussed in-depth in future issues of
THE CODEX. <P>
There are also several devices on the market generally  sold only to law
enforcement agencies that make the job a lot easier and also offer additional
information about cellular calls such as ESN (electronic serial number), NAM
readers, etc. New technologies also allow cellular telephones  to be tracked
electronically to give the users location. Such is the case as in Los Angeles
when the LAPD tracked down OJ Simpson during the infamous car chase with his
buddy Al Cowlings. More in-depth info to follow in the CODEX.<P>

<A NAME="PAGER"></A>
<STRONG>HOW TO INTERCEPT A DIGITAL PAGER</STRONG><P>
With the explosion of people using digital pagers as a primary form (10% of
Americans carry pagers) of communications, it was inevitable that someone
would want to intercept this form of communication. Guess what, it's pretty
easy. If you have the proper equipment that is. <P>
What  is a pager and how does it work? A pager is a miniature radio receiver
that has it's own frequency (cap code) that receives a signal  sent out by
the pager company.
There are several types of pagers in use today, numeric, tone, tone & voice,
and alphanumeric display. Each one notifies the user of a message and
possibly displays that message depending on it's format. The message is sent
by radio wave. As you know radio wave can easily be intercepted.  <P>
To intercept pager traffic you need a decoder to automatically decode DTMF
tones such as ASCII, Baudot, CTCSS, POCSAG and GOLAY. You will also need a
good quality radio receiver or scanner. There is also software available to
install in your PC that will control a  scanner and will automatically  lock
onto  target capcodes or even monitor all traffic on a pager channel. This
software is capable of storing all pager traffic from a target capcode and
monitoring up to 5000 pagers at a time!   <P>
In  future issues of THE CODEX we will explore in-depth, actual techniques of
digital pager interception and where to get the hardware and software.<P>

<A NAME="DECODE"></A>
<STRONG>HOW TO DECODE TELEPHONE NUMBERS OFF A TAPE RECORDING</STRONG><P>
From time to time we have all recorded telephone conversation by means of an
automatic telephone recording device, answering machine, etc. When you play
back the tape, you will hear the telephone numbers dialed by the target
telephone. How do you tell what number is dialed without buying an expensive
DTMF decoder?<P>
Use your digital beeper! It's simple. Fast forward the tape recording to the
target tones and hit pause on the recorder.
Dial up your digital pager and when you hear the prompt, put the mouthpiece
of the telephone handset to the speaker on the recorder and press play on the
recorder. After the number has played press the # key on the telephone
handset to send the message. In a few minutes when your digital beeper
sounds, the target telephone number will be displayed on your digital pager.
This procedure can be repeated over and over to list all target telephone
numbers on the tape recording. No need to buy expensive decoding equipment.
We know several private investigators in the New York City metropolitan area
that charge up to $75. to decode one telephone number!<P>

<A NAME="MODIFY"></A>
<STRONG>HOW TO MODIFY AN INEXPENSIVE TAPE RECORDER FOR LONG PLAY/RECORDING</STRONG><P>
We've all seen those ads in the back of electronics magazines or browsed
through the friendly or not so friendly neighborhood spy shop. Ever wonder
how they slow down those cassette tape recorders so they record at slower
speeds? Some even record at six hours per side with a TDK-180 tape. It's done
two ways.<P>
The first is mechanical. Depending on the type of recorder, the unit is
opened up and the belt is removed from the drive shaft. The pulley head is
removed and cut in half, a looser belt is inserted in replacement for the
original and re-inserted so it lays on the shaft. The pulley head is replaced
to hold the belt down. Costs about 25 cents and the so called "Spy Stores" in
NYC sell these modified tape recorders for 10 times the original price! This
method is NOT very dependable.<P>
The second way is electronically. This requires a little more skill. The
recorder is disassembled, and you'll  need to find the power source.
Generally, you would want a schematic. A resistor is placed across a circuit
to effectively cut the run time in half. This will cause the recorder to play
and record at half speed. If the recorder normally records for one hour per
side it will now record at two hours per side. By adding additional
resistance to the circuit you can control the play/record time Actual "how
to" with certain recorder models in upcoming additions of the Codex.<P>

<A NAME="LISTEN"></A>
<STRONG>HOW TO LISTEN INTO YOUR HOME & OFFICE WHEN YOU'RE AWAY ON VACATION</STRONG><P>
Ever wonder what's going on when you're away from your home or office? Wife
or girl friend cheating? Employees robbing you blind? Suppose you could
listen in to any room conversation remotely? Suppose you could listen in to
any telephone like or even any telephone extension in your business. Even
when you're laying on the beach in Tahiti.<P>
You can. It might not be quite legal but this is how it's done.  Ever hear of
an infinity transmitter? They're sold mostly in kit form and you'll find them
in the back of electronics magazines or law enforcement equipment suppliers.
These devices allow the user to remotely listen in to a location over
existing telephones lines from anywhere in the world. Generally you'd install
a non-pub telephone line in your home or office, then install one or several
of these devices on the non-pub line and in the target rooms. You dial up the
location from anywhere and enter a security code. This allows you to
selectively listen clearly into any room on the premises. There is another
system that can hook into your on-premises telephone system that will allow
you to listen into any telephone line on-premises or even any telephone
extension (for larger businesses). Imagine walking down the street in New
York and listening on your cellular telephone to your business partner in Los
Angeles trying to put the screws to you! More in-depth info on this subject
in upcoming issues of THE CODEX. <P>

<A NAME="SEE"></A>
<STRONG>HOW TO SEE INTO YOUR HOME & OFFICE WHEN YOU'RE AWAY ON VACATION</STRONG><P>
When listening-in just isn't good enough. Imagine the look on your live-in
girlfriends face when you show her video of her escapades when you were away
on business. How about video of your employees stealing merchandise from your
business. The technology exists to remotely monitor video cameras hidden in
your home or office over telephone lines from anywhere in the world.
There are several systems on the market today that allow for slow scan or
real time video transmission over telephone lines. All you have to do is
install one or several video cameras (preferably covert ones) on the target
premises. Hook them up to the video transmitter, plug the video transmitter
into the telephone line (preferably a non-pub number) and the system is ready
to be monitored. From a remote location you would dial up the target
telephone number, activate the video receiver and enter your security code.
You can activate the cameras by touch-tone on the telephone handset (push #1
for camera #1, etc.). You can activate or even videotape each camera at will.
Some systems also allow for audio monitoring of the target location provided
a microphone has been previously installed.<P>
This system can also monitor several  locations around the country or the
world remotely. In future issues of THE CODEX we will explore in-depth the
various systems available and where to acquire one inexpensively.<P>

<A NAME="DETECT"></A><STRONG>
HOW TO DETECT AN EAVESDROPPING DEVICE PLANTED IN YOUR HOME OR OFFICE</STRONG><P>
Am I bugged? How can I find out? What equipment do I need? What does a bug
look like? Well, we'd need a few hundred pages to give you a full background
on the subject but we'll talk today about a few of the basics. The most
important element of TSCM (technical surveillance countermeasures) is the
physical search. Everything in the target premises must be disassembled and
inspected. The search should include, furniture, appliances, telephones,
computers, wiring, speakers, etc. The electrical wiring should also be
inspected. Room bugs can be attached to telephone wiring so you should
inspect that also (telephone bugs and wiretapping detection will be covered
in another article). Unless your really a bad guy and some agency is after
you, the equipment you're looking for is probably not state of the art. The
most common way to bug a room is a hidden hardwired microphone run to a
nearby listening post. This has some pros and cons. The next most common way
is a wireless microphone (commonly refereed to as a bug). Most radio bugs are
battery operated and have short transmitting life and range.Radio bugs can
generally be detected using a field strength meter, scanner, spectrum
analyzer or countersurveillance receiver. Hard wired microphones are more
difficult unless you're using a non-linear junction detector. These sell
commercially for between $18,000 to $40,000. In a future issue of THE CODEX
we'll go in-depth into TSCM, discussing ALL known methods of detection and
we'll tell you how to build a NLJD for under $1,000.!<P>

<A NAME="ACQUIRE"></A>
<STRONG>HOW TO ACQUIRE PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ON ANYONE</STRONG><P>
Recent reports in national magazines report that every person living in this
country has a file on them somewhere in some computer. Some reports even
suggest that the average American could be listed in as many as 200 different
data banks. So much for privacy, heh? What's worse is that most of this
information is public record and just about anyone has access to it. 
Usually when private detectives try to dig up dirt on you, they look in the
following areas: criminal history, consumer credit history, motor vehicle
reports, drivers license information, education verification, social security
number verification, prior employment verification, employment & earnings
history, workers compensation history, business credit reports, professional
license verification, name & address searches, primary residence checks,
telephone records including records of local & long distance phone calls,
what you charged, where and when on your credit cards, etc. Not a pretty
picture. Some of this information is public, some is not. Some information is
gathered legally and some is not.<P>
In future issues of THE CODEX we will discuss in-depth various methods of
obtaining confidential information about individuals and businesses. All
methods including various subterfuges will be covered. We will also list
hundreds of sources to obtain information and how it's done. <P>

<STRONG>INTERESTING NEWS BITS</STRONG><P>
According to a recent new article in the New York Times, the US Customs
service recently raided 40  "Spy Stores" in 24 cities nationwide and arrested
owners and employees on various charges ranging from sale and possession of
illegal eavesdropping devices to smuggling.<P>
According to the US attorney in Manhattan " these devices made possible the
total and secret destruction of our privacy". According to US Customs the
investigation lasted 17 months and Customs estimates that these shops sold
over 4,400 illegal bugging devices valued at 3 million dollars, illegally. 
Shops in the New York City area that were busted are The Spy Store on
Christopher Street, owners Brian Dunn and Anthony Palma both former NYPD
detectives were arrested. The Quark Spy Centre on Third Ave, owners Brian
Griffith and Norman Buitta were arrested. SpyMasters of Rockville Centre,
owner Phil Rosen was arrested. Spy Mart of Morganville, NJ, owner Michael
Falcone was arrested and Allied Products of Clifton, NJ owner Victor Intiso
was arrested. <P>
According to an 106 page affidavit filed by US Customs agent William DeArman
" these shops sold there wares to drug dealers and other criminals".
