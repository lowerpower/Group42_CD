Subject: MCI Reenters Wireless


By STEVE GEIMANN
Senior Editor, {Communications Daily}

     MCI returned to wireless Mon. with $190-million purchase of
Nationwide Cellular Services (NCS) of N.Y. and is negotiating
agreements with other carriers to expand coverage nationwide.  NCS
operates in 10 U.S. cities in Northeast, Upper Midwest and West Coast,
covering 25% of U.S. population.  MCI needs greater coverage to be
significant player in wireless resale against AT&T Wireless and
Sprint-Cable alliance in winning PCS licenses.  Neither MCI nor
Nationwide bid in broadband auction.  "We don't have to own underlying
facilities to deliver service," said Kevin Inda, senior mgr., investor
relations.  "There's a glut of spectrum available."

     MCI deal prompted Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association to step up lobbying against amendment to HR-1555 by Rep.
Barton (R-Tex.) that would give wireless resellers direct access to
facilities built by service providers.  MCI last week sent letter to
Hill supporting Barton amendment.

 In letter Mon. to House Commerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.), CTIA
Pres.  Thomas Wheeler said: "MCI is attempting to impose on
competitive wireless carriers regulations which it vigorously opposes
having imposed on itself."

 He told us: "The danger is it's [amendment] going to disincent people
to build."

     MCI said negotiations with carriers focus on resale agreements
rather than equity purchases, company said.  NCS is largest reseller,
and other investments wouldn't have same benefits, source said.  Inda
said he expected company to sign additional agreements rapidly --
within 60-90 days.  "This is a good initial jump [into market,] but by
no means the full deployment," Inda told us.  NCS acquisition gives
MCI access to "good operating staff."

      MCI left wireless in 1986 with sale of its Air Signal cellular
and paging unit to subsidiary of McCaw for $120 million.  It had
entered business in 1982, primarily supplying paging services in 35
markets and phone service in 12 cities.  Inda said executives decided
then that company "lacked critical mass" to make wireless successful
venture.  MCI skipped recent PCS auction, saying it preferred to
concentrate on resale rather than invest in facilities.

     Transaction still requires approvals by MCI board and shareholders, 
Nationwide shareholders and state and federal agencies.  NCS Chmn.
Stephen Katz and other executives have agreed to vote their 25% stake
in company in favor of deal.  NCS board approved transaction,
companies said.  NCS had 1994 revenue of $213 million, with 275,000
business and residential customers in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago,
L.A., Milwaukee, N.Y., Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, D.C.

The rate game is so rediculous!  For every person who says that
Sprint's rates are only one cent a minute lower than AT&T's I can show
you three people who say they've saved a ton of money by using their
service.  In fact one user on this newsgroup got 50 dollar credits and
free air fare to Bermuda or something like that -- isn't that indeed
worth something?

Bottom line is -- what does your provider do for you today?  Any of
the companies can provide you with low rates - it's up to you to do
what you need to do in order to get the best deal.  Everyone is so
hung up on what the rate per minute is -- price, price, price -- when
was the last time anyone ever bought anything based on price and price
alone?  If I told you that I could sell you a pair of shoes for ten
bucks -- would you buy them?  How 'bout this?  I'll sell you my car for
500 bucks -- wanna buy it?  NO? Well, why not, its CHEAP isn't it?

My point is that there is value to be had in telecommunications --
just like in anything else.  If you're not seeing any value in your
current company's services, you should speak to them or go with
another carrier who will bring you this value.

When you compare companies -- you should attempt to look beyong the
rate per minute.

Subject: Canadian Telephone/Cable Competition Policy Announced


(The CRTC announced 19th May the recommended regulatory approach to be
taken for dealing with the development of future services by the
telephone and cable companies in Canada. The following is their news
release on the subject (with approrpriate WWW references))

May 19, 1995

COMPETITION AND CULTURE ON CANADA'S INFORMATION HIGHWAY: MANAGING THE
REALITIES OF TRANSITION

OTTAWA/HULL -- The CRTC today recommended steps to accelerate lasting
competition in the delivery of electronic information and programming
services to Canadians. It also suggested new ways of keeping Canada on
its own broadcasting system with strong Canadian programming.

"We've received a clear message that consumers want greater choice and
we believe that they should have it," said CRTC Chairman Keith Spicer.
"Hundreds of Canadians who participated in our public processes also said
that they want more windows on their own communities, as well as on the
world, and the CRTC will actively support these objectives."

"The Commission has already taken bold steps to increase competition in
the delivery of broadcasting and telecommunications services, and it
continues to share the vision of Government that further competition will
stimulate choice, innovation and growth. We are not looking for ways to
slow competition -- we'll be looking for ways to hasten it."

"It is essential that barriers to competition arising as a result of the
monopoly power or dominant position of telephone and cable companies be
reduced. More choice should also be allowed in how programming services
are packaged and distributed," Mr. Spicer affirmed.

"If the future is to be driven by competition and technology, then we must
ensure that it is *fair* and *sustainable* competition -- that is, lasting.
We must get beyond slogans and recognize the realities of competition in
Canada and manage this transition imaginatively and sensibly or we will end
up with one or two mega-corporations controlling the creation and
dissemination of information and entertainment," said Mr. Spicer. "We
believe in competition that will benefit consumers and entrepreneurs in the
long-term, not just for a year or two until one industry or competitor
annihilates its rivals."

"A more competitive model for both distribution and programming services
must also take into account Canadian realities. If Canadians are to benefit
from increased choice, entry should be managed in a manner that contributes
to the Canadian broadcasting system and the development of quality
programming," Mr. Spicer explained. "The citizens of Canada are more than
just consumers. They are also and first of all Canadians, and as such they
want to see Canadian values reflected in the programming and information
available to them."

The Commission's report to the Government on policy issues related to the
information highway follows an intensive seven-month public consultation
process during which the CRTC received 1,085 written comments and 78
participants intervened at a month-long oral public hearing in March. This
public process was instituted pursuant to an Order in Council issued by the
Government on October 11, 1994.

In preparing its report, the Commission has been guided by a number of key
principles, including:

* Fair and sustainable competition requires that consumers have increased
choice among distributors of telecommunications and broadcasting services,
including cable, telephone, wireless, direct-to-home (DTH) satellite and
others.

* Barriers to competition in distribution must be removed so that both the
public and content providers have affordable and non-discriminatory access
to all distribution systems.

* New programming services must contribute to increasing choice, diversity
and innovation.

The Commission recommends that there be no mandated transitional period
before introducing full competition in the delivery of telecommunications
and broadcasting services to Canadians. As indicated in the report, factors
such as technology and market forces will create a natural transition period
of about three to four years before telephone companies begin to establish
any significant presence in the cable market. "However," Mr. Spicer said,
"telephone companies should be permitted to enter the cable business as soon
as inherent barriers to effective competition in local telephony are reduced.
And we support, without delay, applications by other potential programming
distributors."

"We also support increased competition in programming. Video-on-demand
services should be eligible for licensing as soon as non-preferential
video-dial-tone tariffs are filed and approved," Mr. Spicer added.

The report proposes mechanisms designed to remove existing barriers to 
competition, as well as safeguards to prevent anti-competitive practices 
and to ensure equitable access to the information highway.

For example:

* Implementation of the open access policy adopted in the Commission's
Regulatory Framework Decision of September 1994 is a precondition
to effective competition in the local telephone market and in
all markets on the information highway. This policy is characterized
by liberalized interconnection, co-location and unbundling requirements.

* Programming services should be produced and distributed by
separate companies to prevent preferential access to distribution
networks and to ensure diversity and choice. (Structural separation,
however, would not be required for non-programming services such
as on-line services, home banking and Internet access.)

* Cable company affiliates should not generally be authorized
to operate, own or control programming services, other than over-the-air
radio and television services, until there is sufficient capacity
on cable networks and comprehensive access rules are in place
to prevent preferential treatment.

Increased reliance on market forces, however, must take into account
the other objectives of broadcasting and telecommunications legislation
from which the CRTC derives its mandate. The *Broadcasting Act*
states that:

"The Canadian broadcasting system should encourage the development of
Canadian expression by providing a wide range of programming that reflects
Canadian attitudes, opinions, values and artistic creativity, by displaying
Canadian talent in entertainment programming and by offering information and
analysis concerning Canada and other countries from a Canadian point of
view..." (Section 3).

The Canadian telecommunications policy has, as its objectives, to
facilitate the development of a system that serves "*to safeguard,
enrich and strengthen the social and economic fabric of Canada and its
regions*" and "*to render reliable and affordable telecommunications
services of high quality accessible to Canadians in both urban and rural
areas...*" (Section 7 of the *Telecommunications Act*).

The Commission, therefore, recommends the following:

* Some form of subsidization, as well as cooperation between governments 
and shared use of network infrastructures by distributors, will be
necessary in order to deliver the benefits of the information highway
to every region in Canada, particularly in remote and underserved
areas.

* Programming services should continue to be licensed in a manner that
takes into account market size and ensures that existing and future
producers have sufficient resources to produce quality Canadian
programming.

* All broadcasting undertakings should make equitable and appropriate
contributions to the production and distribution of Canadian cultural-content
products and services.

"It is essential that we maintain a Canadian broadcasting system
offering quality programming which reinforces the sovereignty of our
country and our own cultural identity," Mr. Spicer concluded.

Subject: Re: T1.403 ESF and CRC-6 Usefulness


The CRC-6 is to many users the entire reason for using SF over ESF
DS1s.

The CRC-6 is a checksum calculated on the actual data transmitted in
the payload (the 24 64 Kbs timeslots) of the DS1.  It is a way to
determine with complete accuracy that the data carried on the DS1 has
not been corrupted.

In the SF world it is not possible to do this.

The CRC-6 is the basis for "path"-based performance monitoring
parameters.  One CRC-6 violation is a path coding violation, each
second in which one happens is an errored second path, each second in
which 1544 or more is a severely errored second path, each second
after 10 SESP is an unavailable second, etc.

Both SF and ESF DS1s share "line" parameters which are based on
Bipolar Violations (BPVs).  BPVs indicate a probability of data
corruption but do not guarantee it.

The bottom line is that you MUST transmit an accurate CRC-6 on an ESF
DS1.  If not it is likely that the far end will go into alarm based on
an "unavailable seconds" condition.  If you want to ignore the incoming 
CRC-6 that's your problem.

This is assuming, of course, that the network is not set up for
far-end performance monitoring which brings another set of contstraints.

Subject: Re: Last Laugh! Mike and Terry's Lawnmower Service  


Pat -

One small correction to your note.  GTE used to own Sylvania and several 
other electronics manufacturing businesses worldwide.  GTE has sold off 
the electronics over the past years to concentrate on our core business 
of telecommunications.  The consumer electronics (televisions and 
stereos) primarily went to Phillips and Magnavox.  I forget who bought 
the lightbulb business in 1992 and 1993.

GTE's vision is to expand from our strong base in wireline voice 
communications to market leadership in the new world of intergrated 
wireline and wireless voice, video and data communications, by offering 
customers products and prices that are competitive and service that is 
unmatched -- the easiest company to do business with in this industry.

GTE has made a strong commitment to the telecommunications industry.  

We could debate the merits of any company which has grown up under a 
very paternalistic regulatory system.  The fact of the matter remains 
that approximately 93% of all homes in the US have telephone service.  
Had telephone originally (100 years ago) been left as a competitive 
industry would we have achieved this level of service?  I suggest that 
we would not have the same results today.  In all likelihood, 
telephone would be a privilege for those with a certain amount of 
wealth, as opposed to a utility available to the masses.  

Was total rate of return regulation the best option available?  Probably 
not, when was the last time the government used the best option.  My 
knowledge of economics points toward some form of marginal rate of 
return or price regulation.

Going forward, competition appears to be the best option for 
encouraging efficient use of resources and developing new technologies 
or new applications of technologies.  However, since telephone (POTS at   
a minimum) is a *utility*, some mechanism needs to be in place to enable 
all people access to the network.  Today we use subsidies such as the 
Universal Service Fund and Lifeline to try to reach all who wish to be 
connected.  The regulated monopolies are required to provide service to 
all who apply (the worst credit risks may fall into special rules).  Who 
will serve these customers in the future?  

Don't get me wrong; I am a strong capitalist.  I also believe it is 
harmful to the capitalist economy to create a markedly disadvantaged 
underclass by cutting someone off from a basic need.  Anyone on the net 
know how difficult it can be to get a job or credit without a telephone 
number?  

For all of the readers who believe the established LECs are incapable of 
doing it right, maybe it is time to reassess the situation.  Look at the 
industry from a more forward view, rather than relying on history.  
Remember most of the knowledge and computer hardware/software 
that enables the huge leaps in telecommunications which we have seen 
were not even dreamed of 30 or 40 years ago.  Just as IBM has had to 
reshape itself to the technological world it helped create, the LECs are 
learning a whole new game too.

Sorry to have rambled so long, Pat.  Thank you for providing a forum in 
which reasonable individuals can discuss and debate relevant issues.  
The Digest is one of my favorite morning routines.

Pat -

This is not an offical company response, however, GTE doesn't make
lightbulbs anymore.  Nor do we manufacture consumer electronics.
GTE's businesses, near as I can recall, are: local telephone service,
mobile telephone service, directory publishing, government contracting, 
and multi-media production including games.  There are some other
businesses also, but the first four are the lion's share of the
revenue.  Again, this is from memory.  You may want to make this
correction for your readers.

Organization: Center for Machine Translation, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA


I was recently hired by a company to start up a help desk. Every other
time I have dne something like this the phone system was already in
place. Not here, not now. Blah!

One of my jobs is going to be researching and purchasing a new phone
system that we can afford. Currently we have seven incoming voice lines
running through Bell Centrex service. No local PBX or anything. 

What I am looking to do is streamline the calling process. I need to set
up a menuing system, an audiotext system, voice mail and so forth. I've
been looking at this software/hardware package from SpeechSoft. What I
am curious about is can this system run off of a centrex service? Is it
a good solution? Does anyone have any experience with it?

A local provider has also been trying to sell us a Toshiba Strata DK280
as a solution. Does anyone know if this system has peripherals to handle
audiotext? Is it a good system and so forth and or not.

Any clue as to what I should be doing would be greatly appreciated.
Also, any leads on introductory books on CTI and Telephony would be 
fantastic. I just wish I hadn't accepted this contract ... blah

Well, nothing *I* am aware of, that I'd trust to do a halfway decent job. 
Thinking about the problems of reliability sorta starts me towards a fair 
sized headache ... (deep breath)

I suppose we *could* build something like this, that you could expect, 
oh, an 80% reliability rate out of. But it would cost orders of magnitude 
more, even if you didn't want maintenance or support.  If you think about 
the problems for a minute or two, you'll see why. (Did we get an 
answering machine? If so, do we have a beep yet? What kind of beep? Has 
the beep ended, and can we talk now? Did we get a forward to a pager? If 
so, what number to we tell 'em to dial.? Are we talking to a person? Is 
it the right person, i.e, do we want to do voice-recognition at all? Do 
we want to be interactive? Do we want to deal with the 30% of the 
population that doesn't have touch-tone service?)

Take your desired cost, treble it, multiply by 10, and you're getting to 
the ballpark, honestly. And you'll still miss, about 20% of the time, no 
guarantees it'll do that well ... more likely it will end up in the 
$5-$10K area for acceptable performance.

And no, that's not a bid. My interest is technical, I do NOT want to 
actually be responsible for this thing!

Actually that was Commander Eugene F. McDonald.  Perhaps you were thinking 
of Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the {Chicago Tribune}?

WEFM was almost certainly the first FM station in the Midwest, but it was
by no means the first in the U.S. -- that was Major Armstrong's own
W2XMN, outside New York City.  (The first *commercial* FM station,
according to the FCC, was WSM-FM in Nashville -- then called W47NV --
on January 1, 1941.)  The Zenith station was originally an experimental
operation called W9XZR on 42.8 MHz, apparently started around 1939; it
became a commercial station in 1941 as W51C on 45.1 MHz, then became
WWZR around 1944-45 when the special "channel number and city" FM calls 
were abolished.  They finally moved to 99.5 MHz some time after 1946;
when that happened Zenith started adding an unlabeled dot at that
position on the dials of all their FM radios.  I don't know when the
WEFM call sign was adopted, other than that it was before FM stereo
broadcasts began in 1961.  (Of course the station is now WUSN -- I
wonder what Commander McDonald would think of *those* initials on
"his" station...:-)

Zenith also had two experimental TV stations at different times.
W9XZV was started in 1939, and became a commercial station as WTZR in
the early 1940s.  They kept their experimental status active and ran a
small market test of a pay-per-view service around 1950-51 with 600
customers (all of whom were lent new Zenith TVs, the only make
compatible with the PPV decoders).  Some time after the test was over
Zenith sold the station to CBS (allegedly at a very tidy profit); it's
now WBBM-TV.  The second was on channel 38 in the late 60s and early
70s (I've forgotten the call sign), and was used to test different
scrambling systems for over-the-air pay TV.  (I suspect the folks at
Zenith wish they'd kept that operation -- when they were field testing
Digital Spectrum Compatible HDTV in 1992 they ended up doing the
broadcasts on WMVT, channel 36 in Milwaukee.  WMVT usually can't be
received around Chicago because of a low-power station on the same
channel, but the HDTV tests came in fine at Zenith's lab in Glenview.)

a big factor in getting WGN 720-AM on the air in 1922, which was assigned

Not to carry this thread too much farther than it merits here, but...

The great frequency switch on AM happened on March 29, 1941.  The goal
of the new "North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement," or NARBA,
was to create some new clear channels for Canada and Mexico, and to
coordinate the expansion of the AM band from 1500-1600 kHz.

WGN had never been on 730 -- it (along with most everything else below
720 kHz) stayed put at 720.  Stations further up the dial were shifted
10, 20, 30, or even in some cases 40kHz to accomodate new Can/Mex clear
channels at 730, 800, 900, 1010, and so forth.   So for PAT's native
Chicago, WMAQ stayed put at 670, WBBM went from 770 to 780, WLS/WENR
from 870 to 890, WAAF from 920 to 950, WCFL from 970 to 1000, WMBI from 
1080 to 1110, WJJD from 1130 to 1160, WCRW/WEDC/WSBC from 1210 to 1240,
WGES from 1360 to 1390, and WEHS/WHFC from 1420 to 1450.

Much more information can be gleaned from the NARBA page on the Boston
Radio Archives web site -- set your URL to:

ftp://radio.lcs.mit.edu/radio/bostonradio.html

for more than you ever wanted to know about the history of Boston radio
and radio in general.

Pat-

You were writing about receiving a carrier on 660 Khz that turned out
to be WBBM right there in Chicago.  The explanation given about
subtracting this from that gives 660 Khz is not really the answer in
that situation.  What you had there is a 2A-B mix occurance and most
likely was happening in your receiver.  If you multiply 720 by 2 and
subtract 780, you end up with 660.  I have to chase things like this
routinely and an example of this was in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on an
amateur radio site that had both a two meter repeater and a packet
base station in close proximity.  The repeater transmitter was on
145.290 and the packet transmited on 144.990.  The packet base caused
no problems when it transmitted alone, nor did the repeater.  However,
if both transmitters were up at the same time, 2x144.990 - 145.29= the
input of the repeater, 144.690.  Since this was an on-frequency
product, there was no option but to move one of the transmitters and
the packet system did move to a site outside of Hershey.
 
I believe in your instance, there may have been some mixing going on at the
AM transmitter sites, but far more likely is the mixing was going on in your
own receiver as it had a clear shot at both carriers at approximately the
same signal stregnth.
 
In my amateur example also, the packet held up the repeater for extended
periods of time because the packet was the digipeater for the local amateur
packet BBS system.

If the signal is strong it compresses the front end of the reciver,
causing the receiver to work in the non-linear region.  What you saw
is the third order IM product (2f1-f2), where f1 = 720 and f2 = 780.
I bet you could have heard it also on 840.

Sorry, dear Moderator, you can't truthfully accuse me of any crime
here.  The phone was in the WAITING AREA, the same room as me and the
other lost Amtrak passengers.  Neither it or I were anywhere NEAR any
of the offices.  Period.  That is why I thought that it was pretty
unique that they would have phree phones (there were TWO in that
waiting room!) right in the midst of the chairs where the wayward
passengers were sitting and waiting to be processed.  They were plain,
not marked (no signs) and there was not an employee desk anywhere
within sight.  We are talking passenger area, NOT an office area.

Oh, THAT'S easy.  Go to the station and ask where they direct the passengers
who have missed their train connections!  NO PROBLEM.  :)

(Betcha those phones have been "discovered" since then ... I'd be
surprised if they are *still* sitting so easily on the tables in the
waiting room since I saw them ...)

Try asking an old-time Amtrak employee about the phones ... as in someone
who would have been working in the lost-passenger area all the way back
to 1990.

Because of the "band" system for local calls used by Ameritech, you'll
want to find a provider who's central office is within 8 miles of your
central office -- otherwise you pay Ameritech by the minute, rather than
a flat per-call rate.

It gets worse -- _ALL_ outgoing calls on business lines are charged by the
minute.

Some other problems: where there is a conflict among "priority

"second choice" that priority applicants are supposed to be due.
 
This is because the system, as delineated to date, calls for immediate

Also, the Dedham switch crashed, resetting some people's voicemail to
"none", so that you would just get the "has left the calling area"
message instead of being transferred into voicemail. If the customer
called the system to check the mailbox, everything appeared normal
(except that there would be no mail waiting).  There was no indication
tht anything was amiss, and Cell One did nothing to inform anyone.

I only found out because someone called me at home to ask me why I

turned it back on for me.  Presumably many other customers do not know

The {Rochester Democrat & Chronicle's} weekly online telecommunication
column recently reviewed this service and implied that it was, indeed,
cooperating with France's PTT/Minitel service for provision of the
service.  I don't believe this was explicitly stated, however.

Additionally, the reviewer gave NYNEX very poor marks for its

NYNEX listings for businesses in Rochester are very sparse, owing to
the fact independent Rochester Tel holds on to their listings like

As for our host being located in France, the first online yellow pages

   THE FCC COULD HAVE A GOING-OUT-OF-BUSINESS SALE
   
   Copyright 1995 by Peter Huber. Electronic copies of this document may
   be distributed freely, provided that this notice accompanies all
   copies.
   
   ------------------
   
Here's how Congress can raise $10 billion a year and cut government
at the same time. No new taxes. No phony accounting. No leveling the
timber in national parks. No kidding.
   
Economists have known for years that the best way to manage the
airwaves is to sell them off in orderly parcels, and then let the
market decide how best to use them. Recently, however, economists have
been putting numbers to this argument. The numbers are stunning.
   
Congress nationalized all radio spectrum in 1927. Ever since, the
Federal Communications Commission has been zoning chunks for one use
or another -- radio, paging, satellites, whatever happened to hit the
commission's fancy -- and then assigning allotments to favored
applicants who promised to use the spectrum accordingly. Until
recently, no money changed hands, just political favor.
   
The secondary market, however, gives us a good idea what those
individual licenses are worth. When a company like McCaw sells to AT&T
for $17 billion, it's easy enough to infer the value of the FCC
licenses in the transaction. On that basis, the commercial spectrum
currently used for broadcast, cellular telephone, satellite and so on
is worth somewhere between $100 billion and $300 billion. If all
spectrum were leased on long-term contracts rather than sold, it would
generate additional federal revenues of $10 billion to $20 billion a
year. This compares with $3 billion currently generated from offshore
oil and gas leases and royalties, and $28 million generated from
federal grazing fees.
   
To its credit, the FCC recently took a first, reasonably successful,
stab at selling off spectrum licenses. In the last 12 months, the
various auctions of ten-year licenses of spectrum for so-called
personal communications services (meaning: cellular phone service)
have raised about $10 billion. The commission would have raised even
more if ownership had been sold outright.
   
The FCC and other government agencies are sitting on billions of
dollars of additional bandwidth, which remains idle while federal
bureaucrats ponder how to assign it. The creation of the cellular
industry, which today generates $20 billion or so a year in revenue,
was delayed for a decade while the FCC fretted about whether and how
it should allocate spectrum to this newfangled use.
   
It's a safe bet that there are other $20 billion industries just
waiting for the FCC to awake from its slumber.
   
Spectrum that has already been given away presents a more subtle
financial opportunity. Buyers in the secondary market -- AT&T, for
example -- can cogently argue that they already paid for their
spectrum when they wrote a check to primary licensees like Craig
McCaw. At this point there's no fair or politically feasible way for
the government to reclaim those licenses.
   
But even here, the FCC still has something very valuable to sell. The
FCC never quite gave away spectrum to anyone -- it issued fixed-term
licenses. The property, in theory, reverts to the FCC when the leases
expire. At present, licensees spend lavishly on lawyers every time
they renew or transfer a license. Quite often they have to buy off
challengers who file objections for the sole purpose of legal
extortion. Existing licensees would pay good money to convert their
lease into ownership free and clear.
   
Yet another way for the government to raise a chunk of money is to
sell legal erasers. At present, spectrum licenses are strictly zoned.
If you're licensed to do television, you may not use your spectrum to
do wireless telephony. If the FCC authorized just one UHF television
station in Los Angeles to transfer its spectrum to a third cellular
provider, the overall public gain would be about $1 billion, or so the
government itself estimated in 1992. Nextel was created in just this
way, by an entrepreneur who bought up taxi dispatch licenses and then
persuaded the FCC to rezone them for digital radio services.  Deleting
a few lines of legal boilerplate from all outstanding FCC licenses
would create tens of billions of dollars of new national wealth.
   
Which means that the rights to erase that boilerplate are immensely
valuable. They, too, can be sold. Sold they should be. These rights
are currently in the wrong hands. While the FCC owns them, they just
make work for bureaucrats and inflate the FCC's already bloated $200
million annual budget.
   
The opportunity here is almost too good to be true. A single, clean
piece of dezone-and-auction legislation will raise money, shrink
government and unleash private enterprise on the wireless lanes of the
infobahn industry. Someone should write it.

I thought I'd let you know that I just bought a CT2 phone (digital cordless
phone) and I love it.

Actually, I already had the handset and was using it from time to time
in the street (France Telecom offers a CT2 public service in and
around Paris). A few days ago, I just bought my personal base station.
It's amazing: it is sold with a range of around 1000 feet, just like
most old CT0 phones. But unlike old CT0 phones, which actually start
being noisy when you're just one room away from your base station, my
new CT2 base station will let me call from anywhere in my flat. What's
more, I can even call from 3 floors below, and from several hundred
feet outside, with a perfect sound quality. With all the features
(takes about 3 hours to configure it!), plus the privacy and security
of a digital technology, it is really worth its price.

Is CT2 popular in the U.S.A.?

Subject: My Experiences With GTE's Tele-Go Service


Greetings everyone.  You may remember my posts about GTE Tele-Go
service from a while ago.  Now that I've had it for a while I have
some comments to make.  They say one can use his/her cell phone as a
cordless while at home, with a little gadget called an Enhanced (ha!)
Cordless Base Station., You may remember I mentioned this before.
Finally I got the ECB.  It didn't work.  You are supposed to authorize
your cell phone with the ECB before you can use it.  Mine wouldn't
authorize.

I called, days past.  I called again.  This time I was given a access
charge credit for my troubles.  Finally someone called.  But it was on
a day when I wasn't home.  A few more days past.  Finally I was home
when the guy called.  So he comes out and reprograms my cell handset
and the ECB.  So now the thing authorizes.  Of course I find out that
you can not simply hook your ECB to the phone line (and this is
*wierd*).  You have to use one of those handy two-jack-in-one deals
from Radio Shack and hook a standard phone to one site, and the ECB to
the other.  I can't find anyone who can explain *why* this is
necessary, or what the ECB uses the phone for.  But they say it won't
work if you don't do it this way.  

A thought I just had is that perhaps the ECB does not have the
capacity to dial and perhaps the phone is used to complete the part of
the call which is set up via my POTS line.  It works the same as when
it's in cell mode.  You just dial and then the number is sent to the
cell site (in this case the ECB) and then the ECB goes off-hook and
presumably dials the number.  The sound quality is not as good as when
you use the cell-mode.  It sounds *very* far away and not very loud.
But it gets a little worse.  The ECB dropped all my calls at varying
times.  And I tried a little experiment.  When one is in the range of
their ECB, all calls to their cellular number are to get forwarded to
their POTS line.  The phone ("handset") in question is an Oki Telecom
1150.  You can press Menu and the Green "dial tone" button to have the
phone use cell-mode instead of the ECB.  I have call forwarding on my
cellular account.  I wanted to see if forwarding my calls would have
any effect on the ECB forwarding.  It did.  It simply quit working.  I
tried deactivating it and all that did was go to the "Your call can
not be completed at this time..." intercept.  

Morning comes.  I call GTE Mobilnet to tell them of my problems.  Re:
The call dropping they say I have an outdated ECB and they'll have to
replace it. I inform them that my ECB forwarding quit working and they
come back and quote me the number I had forwarded my cellular to.  Wow
I said.  I tell the rep of my experiment and she then comes and tells
me that my cell phone was not programmed with the ECB forwarding
number and that I had used an improper code to deactivate the
forwarding. Although the Fine Manual said to use *730, she said that
*720 is proper.  Both of them give confirmation tones when dialed even
though the only custom calling feature I have is forwarding.  So I get
impatient and take the ECB back to a GTE store.  They've sent an order
for a new updated ECB that doesn't drop calls to be sent to me.
Reason they gave for the old one dropping calls was a reaction to line
noise. :-).  So....  The guy at the store who looked at my phone and
ECB said the phone was programmed fine, dispite what the other person
said.  Then how the hell does all this work? :-).  Does the ECB
intercept a celular signal and reroute the call to my POTS line? 
ECB forwarding BTW is free of airtime charges (when it works).

So then are there any alternitives?  When I'm using the cell phone "on
the go", I pay only .25/min regardless of time of day.  and only
$19.95/mo access charge.  But the service area is limited to the 216
area code.  They say I can use national Roamer's Network to make calls
out of my service area, but that it's pricey and charges via a credit
card.  Can anyone tell me how that works?

Can anyone give me .25/min when in the local area and some other
imflated rate when "roaming"?  But with incomming privlanges as well?
Or is it simply not possible and I'm a nut for thinking it should be?

Can the phone system support toll free 1-800 numbers of the format
1-800-0xx-xxxx and/or 1-800-1xx-xxxx?  I know you never see exchanges
in regular area codes starting with 0 or 1, but, as far as I know, one
phone in the "800" "area code" can't just dial seven digits to reach
another phone in 1-800.  Not like phones in regular area codes.  So,
it seems that the phone system would not get confused with 1-800-0xx-xxxx 
or 1-800-1xx-xxxx.

This could add an extra 1/5 possible numbers to 1-800 toll free service.

What have I missed?

Subject: New Area Codes Announced


Bellcore seems to have made a batch of assignments lately:

1) According to the {St. Louis Post Dispatch}, AC 573 has been
assigned to the upcoming split or overlay of AC 314 (to take place in
February 1996).  The Missouri Public Services Commission is holding
hearings on the split vs. overlay question.

2) According to the {Cleveland Plain Dealer}, AC 330 has been assigned
to an upcoming split of AC 216.  The nature of the split is still
uncertain but Cleveland will retain 216.  The timescale is quoted to
be the end of 1995 or early 1996.

3) Ian Fisher (ifisher@unixg.ubc.ca) reports in alt.dcom.telecom that
the {Vancouver Sun} reports that AC 250 has been assigned for a split
of AC 604.  The Greater Vancouver area will retain 604; implementation
will begin in October 1996.

Who is next? According Bellcore's "number exhaustion list" AC 818 in
the Los Angeles metro area, AC 210 in S. Texas (including San Antonio)
and AC 318 in Louisiana are getting close to splits.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: And of course we here in 708 got bypassed
entirely with the pending split to 630, and the northern suburbs of
Chicago will be in 847 sometime next year.   PAT]

Pat,
        
In my world of telephony, we use POTS to differentiate from a Centrex
line also ... for testing purposes in the labs, we order our test lines
by POTS or Centrex.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: So maybe it just is relative to whatever
is going on in the industry. Any simple and unadorned arrangement will

Pat, you could well be correct, because I've heard Plain Old Telephone
Service referred to as POTS for quite some time now. But when I was in
the business office too many years ago, we service reps used to get
"credit" for selling the newer type telephones: touch tone, slimline,
DesignLine, etc. When a customer just wanted the standard dial phone,
s/he was getting a <P>lain <O>ld <T>elephone <S>et. (We did have color
phones and I vaguely recall that we may even have charged extra for
them, but I didn't work there so long ago that "the customer could get
any color they wanted as long as it was black").

Back then, there wern't a lot of options for the "service" end, (at
least for residential customers), so almost everyone got plain old
telephone SERVICE by default.

Come on John, you can't hide behind this thin of a disclaimer !

A cash deposit is required on *any* major installation that requires
capitol investment on a Telco's part, either that or a letter of
guarantee that the service will be used long enough to recover the
cost. This will probably change with real competiton because there
will no doubt be companies that will do it just for the monthly
service charges. As an aside to that there will probably be a lot of
competitors that fail because of poor choices in who they try to
serve.  It will be a gamble: some will win, some will lose and only
the biggest or the most astute will survive.

As regards to other installation requirements, I have no idea what he
means by "The installation site had to have "excess facilities" which
meant that any 976 lines had to be installed on pairs that would never
conceivably be used for POTS."  Perhaps John could explain his
comment.

It's obvious that John knows nothing about the technical side of the
telephone business because any time you go outside the walls of the CO
you're going to have physical requirements: simple physics determines
how far you can push a given signal across a given facility and simple
economics determines how much money to spend to push it any further.
If it costs more to push the signal than the signal costs, there is no
profit in it.  Again, this could change.  And again this could be the
downfall of many companies.  Won't those people who go with the lowest
price be thrilled when there 'real' cost doubles (or more) because
their provider folds and they have to install the service a second
time (and a third, fourth, etc.: providers will not be the only ones
gambling).

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: To the contrary, I think John Higdon has
a very excellent knowledge of the technical side of this business. And
unlike yourself, I cannot imagine a provider going out of business without
making arrangements for its existing customer base to be serviced by 
some other remaining provider. I guess it is possible, but I suspect a
new law might be put on the books saying that existing customer bases 
had to be dealt with by the remaining companies, etc.   PAT]

As a small-time POTS customer, I am interested in the highest quality
service at the lowest possible price.  I don't really care if that's
delivered by competition or a regulated monopoly.

If it's more economical for a local telephone company to deliver a
service or product (due to economies of scale or expertise), then why
not let it deliver it?  For instance, Bell Atlantic charges me cheaper
toll rates than the LD carriers, but Bell is not allowed to provide long
distance service between its own customers if it crosses LATA lines.

Why shouldn't Bell be allowed to provide such service?

And if competing PBX/DID manufacturers can't compete against a Bell
centrex system, should the Bell company be handcuffed or criticized?
There are certain economies of scale of doing everything in one place
(which is why the system became a monopoly in the first place.)

I am glad I can own my own equipment.  But it's interesting how I find
myself seeking Western Electric brand phones instead of newer stuff -- I
find they're more reliable and durable than the "AT&T" brand or anything
else (and I hate chime ringers).

As to customer-owned coin phones, I believe they are tremendous ripoffs.  
The tiny little instruction card is usually misleading and the prices
charged are always higher than Bell coin phones.  Now why is that?
(Anybody involved in this, please, please comment.)


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: They are higher priced because the owner
has to pay the same for the telco connection as the telco charges itself
for its own coin phones. He is not running a charity, or a Union Station
phree phone (like Elana discussed). He wants to make a profit for himself
and telco is detirmined to get their profit one way or another out of it
also. So he has to charge more in order to be able to siphon off some for
himself. Another reason they are usually higher priced is because the 
COCOT owner will put in a phone many times where telco will not put one in.
If telco cannot make a profit from a public phone, then it won't be there
in most instances unless someone else is willing to have a 'semi-public'
coin phone there, allow telco to keep all the money -- paying no commissions
to the owner of the property -- AND pay a monthly fee, typically ten or
fifteen dollars, for having the pay phone there. The COCOT guy in the
meantime goes in the same place, offers to put a phone there and pay
commmissions to the proprietor. Where do those commissions come from?
That's why COCOT phones typically cost more to use, but granted, they are
a ripoff to most of us. For the poor person living in a ghetto slum where
the only available pay phone is the COCOT at the corner liquor store or
lottery agent however, it is probably a lifesaver at times and worth the
cost.  PAT]

TAXPAYER ASSETS PROJECT - INFORMATION POLICY NOTE
May 23, 1995

-    Representative Christopher Cox (R-CA) may offer amendment
     to limit universal service to voice grade telephone
     service.

-    Amendment may lead to higher residential ISDN tariffs

     James Love (202/387-8030; love@tap.org) TAP

     During the May 17, 1995 House Subcommittee on Telecommunications
and Finance mark-up on HR 1555, Representative Christopher Cox (R-CA,
voice 202/225-5611; fax 202/225-9177, staff David Sachs) offered an
amendment that would have limited payments from a universal service
fund to voice grade telephone services that are generally available on
the date the Act passes. The Cox amendment specifically would have
deleted language that would have defined universal service to include:

     "access to advanced telecommunications services and
     capabilities."

     The controversy concerns the new way that telecommunications
services will be priced to consumers.  At present, most states have
monopoly local exchange carriers, which charge prices set by state
regulators to reflect universal service goals, such as lower tariffs
for residential consumers.  As Congress seeks to promote competition
for local telephone service, it is setting up a mechanism to support
universal service that will be funded by "equitable and nondiscriminatory 
contributions" by all telecommunications providers.  These funds will
be used to support universal service goals.  The issue of how the
money will be spent will be decided later.  In the House bill, the
decisions will be made by a joint board composed of federal and state
regulators plus a state consumer advocate.

     It is anticipated that universal service funds will be used to
lower the cost of residential telecommunications services, by lowering
the allocation of joint infrastructure costs paid for by residential
consumers.  By limiting the contributions to voice grade services,
Representative Cox would treat residential ISDN services (or other
digital technologies) differently than residential voice grade
services.  Because ISDN or other digital technologies would not
receive any universal service contributions at all, the cost of
providing the ISDN service would be both the incremental cost of the
providing the technology and the loss of the universal service
contribution.

This is likely to lead to higher ISDN tariffs for some residential
consumers -- particularly where state regulatory commissions have
sought to provide lower ISDN residential tariffs.

     Representative Rick Boucher (D-VA) objected to the Cox amendment,
as freezing technology at present levels.  Cox staffers say he is
trying to freeze regulation, not technology.

The matter was tabled until the full Commerce Committee mark-up
on the 24th.

     TAP VIEW

     TAP opposes the Cox amendment on universal service.  We believe
the Joint Board should have the authority to redefine universal
service according to the broader public interest criteria included in
the original bill, and we believe that high speed ISDN connections
should be included in universal service.

     Below is the original language for universal service, the Cox
amendment, and contact information for the Commerce Committee.

ORIGINAL LANGUAGE ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE AND COX AMENDMENT TO
UNIVERSAL SERVICE.

1.   ORIGINAL LANGUAGE

          `SEC. 246. UNIVERSAL SERVICE.
            `(a) Joint Board To Preserve Universal Service . - Within
30 days after the date of enactment of this part, the Commission shall
convene a Federal-State Joint Board under section 410(c) for the
purpose of recommending actions to the Commission and State
commissions for the preservation of universal service in furtherance
of the purposes set forth in section 1 of this Act. In addition to the
members required under section 410(c), one member of the Joint Board
shall be a State-appointed utility consumer advocate nominated by a
national organization of State utility consumer advocates.

            (b) Principles . - The Joint Board shall base policies
for the preservation of universal service on the following principles:

                (1) Just and reasonable rates . - A plan adopted by
the Commission and the States should ensure the continued viability of
universal service by maintaining quality services at just and
reasonable rates.
                (2) Definitions of included services;
comparability in urban and rural areas  . - Such plan should
recommend a definition of the nature and extent of the services
encompassed within carriers` universal service obligations. 

Such plan should seek to promote access to advanced telecommunications
services and capabilities, and to promote reasonably comparable
services for the general public in urban and rural areas, while
maintaining just and reasonable rates.

                (3) Adequate and sustainable support mechanisms. -
Such plan should recommend specific and predictable mechanisms to
provide adequate and sustainable support for universal service.

                (4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions . -
All providers of telecommunications services should make an equitable
and nondiscriminatory contribution to the preservation of universal
service.
                (5) Educational access to advanced telecommunications
services . - To the extent that a common carrier establishes advanced
telecommunications services, such plan should include recommendations
to ensure access to advanced telecommunications services for students
in elementary and secondary schools.
                
                (6) Additional principles . - Such other principles as
the Board determines are necessary and appropriate for the protection
of the public interest, convenience, and necessity and consistent with
the purposes of this Act.

                (c) Definition of Universal Service . - In
recommending a definition of the nature and extent of the services
encompassed within carriers universal service obligations under
subsection
          (b)(2), the Joint Board shall consider the extent to
which - 

                (1) a telecommunications service has, through
the operation of market choices by customers, been subscribed to
by a substantial majority of residential customers;

                (2) such service or capability is essential to
public health, public safety, or the public interest;

                (3) such service has been deployed in the
public switched telecommunications network; and

                (4) inclusion of such service within carriers`
universal service obligations is otherwise consistent with the
public interest, convenience, and necessity. The Joint Board
may, from time to time, recommend to the Commission
modifications in the definition proposed under subsection (b).

            (d) Report; Commission Response . - The Joint Board
convened pursuant to subsection (a) shall report its recommendations
within 270 days after the date of enactment of this part.  The
Commission shall complete any proceeding to act upon such
recommendations and to comply with the principles set forth in
subsection (b) within one year after such date of enactment.


2.   COX AMENDMENT

Change SEC. 246.(b)(2) Definitions of included services, to
read:  (inserted language in caps]

                (2) Definitions of included services; comparability in
urban and rural areas . - Such plan should recommend a definition of
the nature and extent of the services encompassed within carriers`
universal service obligations THAT IS BASED ON BASIC VOICE-GRADE LOCAL
TELEPHONE SERVICE EQUIVALENT TO THE SERVICE GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO
RESIDENTIAL SUBSCRIBERS ON THE DATE OF ENACTMENT OF THIS PART.  Such
plan should seek to promote

     [STRIKE: access to advanced telecommunications
     services and capabilities, and to promote]

Yes, CT2 *is* wonderful! I have one too ;-)

Did you know that in The Netherlands there is a very substantial CT2
network? It's called "Greenpoint" (formerly "Kermit"), and it's
operated by PTT Telecom.

I live in Amsterdam, and they have set up so many base stations that I
don't even bother to remember the locations anymore. I just count on
getting a signal when I want to call. And 9 out of 10 times I do!

Can you tell me how large the French network (it's called "BeBop",
isn't it?) is? I'm considering to have the roaming option enabled, so
I can use the phone when I'm over there.

By the way, the U.K. used to have *four* (correct me if I'm wrong)
CT2 networks, but all have stopped operations. Damn! 

Enjoy your phone,

   So you can't build a cheap DS0 drop/add for ESF without reconstructing

    I have also seen POTS to mean the provision of regular single-line
telephone service, as separate from all the custom calling features
associated with it.

    This reminds me of the routine that one goes through when ordering
(regular) telephone service.  First, one makes the order for the
service itself: address, number of lines, directory listing, and
billing arrangements, as well as making an appointment for physical
installation, if necessary.  This is the arrangement for POTS.

    Second, the rep tries to sell you some custom calling features.
(Or, if you're on the ball, you tell him exactly what you want ...)
I have heard this part being called, in jest, the arangement for PANS;
a pun on POTS, of course!  I don't remember exactly what the acronym
was purported to stand for: I think it was something very silly along
the lines of "Pretty And Nice Stuff". :-)

It's a relatively simple message-queue based interface for application

The US medium wave band goes 530 KhZ to 1610 kHz. There is a major
transmitter in Los Angeles on 640 (KFI).

But I suspect you are looking for specific transmitters in Europe.

How about the World Radio and TV Handbook, published annually in

With a PBX it shouldn't cause any trouble, but I have been told that just
shorting the line will cause the phone company equipment to show line
trouble.

The new USR Courier modems have a front panel button that can be configured
to perform one of several functions, including busying the line.

Cell One/Boston is owned by Southwestern Bell; I'm sure AT&T did not
purchase any part of Southwestern Bell.  You're thinking of McCaw,
which operates the "A" carrier franchises in many other cities.

The name "CellOne" is actually (as I understand) owned by Southwestern
Bell, who acquired it when they purchased the initial trial systems in
Chicago and Washington.  They license it to any "A" carrier who wishes
to do business under that name.  And, of course, they don't use it in

According to my last bill, that charge is only $1.  I still find it
unjustified.  And their service reps have falsely claimed that NYNEX
also has a detail billing charge, which I do not find on my NYNEX bill.

Interesting.  I did nothing at all and continued to get detail billing
(and started getting the $1 charge).

This was the last straw for Cell One and me.  The actual change was that
the land line charge was changing from a pure pass-through of the local
Telco's message-rate business service charge of 3 cents per call plus
1.6 cents per minute to the new Call One charge of 4 cents per call plus
4.9 cents per minute.

When that happened, I called and complained about them tripling my
per-minute rate (since I was mostly an off-peak user on the old leisure
plan which had been $25 a month and was now $36 a month).  She swore up
and down that they had not tripled the rates.  New math, I suppose.

Since I already had NYNEX service for $11/month and 39 cents peak and
29 cents off peak (no land line at all) I decided that I was sick of
Cell One and would simply stop my practice of useless gabbing on the
phone whenever I was driving somewhere.  I had been using up to 400
minutes a month of off peak time; I'll now have to keep that down to
about 1/3rd as much, but that's the way it goes.  Most of those calls
were really totally unnecessary.

I had retained the $11/month NYNEX service to save money when roaming.
With Cell One's $4/month plus $3/day/system roaming fees, using NYNEX
for roaming instead of Cell One paid for the $11 with only 1-3 days of
roaming per month.  (NYNEX customers are not charged daily fees for
roaming no matter where they go in North America.)

Subject: Re: 800-1XX, 800-0XX

This type of combination HAS been considered by Bellcore's N.American
Numbering as well as the 800 Numbering Administration (Lockheed) and
the telecom.industry forums (ICCF, INC, etc.).  They seem to have
rejected this FOR THE TIME BEING since only 200 possible codes for
line-number assignments could be available.  Instead they will be
going to new special NPA's 888, then 877, 866, 855(?), 844, etc.

There would have been WAY-TOO-MANY switches of all types and owned by
all types of players in North America which would need special
reprogramming to allow CUSTOMER dialable access to a 0 or 1 in the 'D'
digit.

In 1992 (and revised in 93), Bellcore NANPA issued a 70page (or so)
document as an 'IL' on the future of numbering in the North American
Numbering Plan.  I think it is called 'Long-Term Numbering Plan'.  You
can get a copy (free) from Bellcore's NANPA (WHICH MOVED from Livingston NJ 
to Piscataway NJ earlier this month).  It discusses such possibilities
to preserve a 10-digit number within WZ1 by going to an NXX-0XX or
NXX-1XX type of central-office-code -- known as 'unblocking the D
digit' for 0 or 1.

Some of us might think that this would be ambiguous with special
Operator and network special system routing codes as well as test codes
used 'only' by telco personnel.  It does look confusing, but when an
operator needs to reach, say the direct DA operator for a smaller
area, (s)he keys [KP]+NPA+0XX+131+[ST].  The 'ST' key 'ends' the
dialing string, therefore this is NOT the same thing as NPA-0XX-131X
which could be someone's number.

Personaly, I'm NOT in favor of 0XX or 1XX 'regular' central office
codes in geographic central offices.  ANOTHER ambiguity would be with
'non-subscriber'/IXC-issues/RAO-based calling cards (only for those
who follow the Bellcore standard), which are of the form NXX-0/1XX-XXXX 
plus pin (0/1XXX).  An 'arbitrary' calling card issued now could
'eventually' be based on someone ELSE'S home phone number and THEY
'should' be assigned an LEC card based on THEIR phone number.  BUT --I'll 
leave this to Bellcore NANPA (or its successor) and the ICCF, INC, etc.

BTW - Here in the New Orleans area, when you dial (at least using AT&T
and of course SCBell): 1+(or 0+) valid (geographic) NPA+ 0/1XX+xxxx you
get cut off RIGHT AWAY by your originating local Bell switch -- in some
cases right after the NPA-0/1XX, sometimes after the full ten digits.
When you dial 1 + 800 + ANY ten digits, there is a slight delay (while the
800 database is checked) before you get 'clicked-over' to whatever
treatment is to be done.  THIS INCLUDES 800-0XX and 800-1XX dial-strings --
the recording is 'your call cannot be completed as dialed' and it comes from 
the Bell TANDEM switch.

        Free long distance?  That's what it says above, clearly they
must mean that the long distance charge is all that will be paid.  The
same must apply to directory assistance.  They'll charge the 50c to
get the number but not for the time to get the number, if that makes
sense.  Sort of like a cell-phone with free air, you'd still pay for
the d.a. but not for the air.  Bell Canada can't be that stupid as to
give businesses free d.a.

Your response from NMS is somewhat suspect.  The VBX/400, along with
all of their voice processing uses a VOX file format which is proprietary 
to NMS.  They have several conversion programs that will allow you to
convert from other voice file formats to the VOX.  As far as making
prompt files, there are also a series of utilities that can be used to
develop the prompt files, including rules tables to make the systems
count, recite dollars and ordinal numbers, etc.  Everything "SHOULD"
be available from NMS.  We have recently completed a project using a
VBX/400 which we had the prompts recorded in 16 bit linear and converted 
them to VOX using utilities supplied by NMS.  We also developed rules
and prompt files to speak back numbers, dollars, dates, etc in French.

I don't believe that for a minute. NMS Is still making the VBX 400. Do you 
have the developers kit? It has all the information as well as Vscript (the 
NMS scripting language) and ME2 (the "C" interface API)  Call them back and 
get the Vscript stuff, it comes with a great manual and lots of examples.

Maybe you can clear something up for me.

I've got SWBell's Call Notes (Voice Mail) on my ISDN line (Seimens
switch).  Originally they told me that by programming one of my
buttons (Seimens 787 phone) to Feature ID Number 64, the associated
light would act as a message light.

I appear to be the first one in these parts to try to do this, so
we're all learning together.  They managed to enable the stutter tone,
but all we've got the button on FIN 64 to do is clear the stutter
tone.

Is this a problem with the switch?  With switches in general?  With my
phone?  With ISDN in general?

There Stutter Dial Tone Message Waiting devices out there that retail

Subject: Re: A Question About Priorities 
Organization: BNR RTP 


It is certainly true that the interaction of different services
provisioned against a line is a very complicated business.  There is
no single "right" way to set priorities. Bellcore has voluminous
spec's addressing some specific interactions, but there are also CEPT,
ETSI, and other standards bodies, not to mention the requirements of
the telco's and large corporate customer's.  In some cases, a specific
interaction is never defined in advance, it just occurs as whatever
the switch software does, and is then possibly documented afterwards,
if ever.

With that said, I can state one answer to some of your questions.
Call Screening essentially corresponds to the "Call Authorization"
point in call (PIC) in the AIN call model, which comes very early.
Transfer on Busy would tend to come later, at the Selecting Route PIC.
(Transfer on Busy is a feature like any other, and they are all
implemented in software these days.)  So a good reference to where the
PSTN is going regarding service interactions would be a look at the
AIN call model. But as to where it is now, it all depends on the
specific switch.

Except that Cell One/Boston is not a McCaw property.  Cell One/Boston is

No relationship between AT&T and SBC/Southwestern Bell, except
supplier/ customer.

"Cell One" is a shared franchise name for "A" systems.  McCaw/AT&T uses it, 
as do others, including SWB when on the A side.  These companies have nothing
more in common with each other.

Of course there are always two sides to every story. The one presented
here doesn't present the part where if you subscribed to the Jack Doe
phone company you couldn't call neighbor on the John Doe phone
company. It doesn't present the part where different phone companies
were installing poles and wire everywhere and making an eyesore you
wouldn't believe. If you haven't seen pictures of New York and Chicago
in those days you literally would not believe the mess in the air. It
doesn't present the part that much of the competition got eaten up
because they couldn't afford the capital investment needed to compete
and sold out rather than losing everything.

And, once again, we see the "they". As in the conspiracy "they". "They" are

The description of the bureaucrats sounds about right. The problem is
that the bureaucrats didn't make the decisions concerning any of this.
It was elected officials either making the decisions or appointing the
commisioners who did.  So, in essence, the public had as much say
about this as they did about any of the social welfare programs we
have today. I guess one can argue that the public has no say on
anything the government does but that sounds rather extreme.

Uh huh. Just as above, this is only part of the story. Did Allendale
Telephone Company participate in Division of Revenue separations with
the Bell System? If they did, it is quite likely they made out very
well because of the favorable payments received. Of course, this
doesn't make as nearly as good of a conspiracy story.

You are judging what "many" people feel based on your feelings.
Contrary to this most of the surveys I have seen indicate that most
people think they DID receive good value for the service they
received. Most people still feel so.  What most people feel is that
the RBOC's STILL provide good, basic service at a decent price. The
problem is that many also feel the RBOC's are not players on the
technological frontier.

Subject: US Area Code Changes - Test Numbers


On Saturday May 13th the US public-switched telephone network stopped
completing calls to southern Alabama that were dialed using the old
"205" area code.  The new area code for this region is "334", which is
the first of a new series of area codes that are being assigned
without a "0" or "1" as the second digit.

By dialing the test numbers listed below, users can find out whether
they can reach locations that are using the new US area codes.
Recorded messages indicate whether you have successfully reached the
test number, or if it could not be completed.  Overseas (i.e. non-US)
locations, small offices, and users with telephones connected to a
PABX should test the numbers to see if they can be reached.

Subject: GTE Mobilenet Battle Rages On


Flashback to September: I had just signed on with GTE Mobilenet in
California, only to find them pulling the same old tricks.  They
resell long distance service (from AT&T and Sprint), unlike Cellular
One here in the Bay Area (BATCS).  When asked for long distance rates,
they refer you off to AT&T.  When the bill comes, the AT&T rate
doesn't match the GTEM rate (big surprise).

I filed complaints with the PUC in California.  After wasting a
month or so, they said, roughly, "no problem here - they are
charging the tariffed rates for California traffic."  And,
to my utter amazment, they were.  GTEM rates are within cents
of the AT&T in-state rates.  Since this now was an inter-state
issue, I filed an informal complaint with the FCC.

[the wavy lines disappear, as we snap back into the present]

About a month ago, I got a nice letter from the FCC telling be that
they had asked AT&T and GTEM to respond to my complaints.  AT&T sent
me a letter a few days after, telling me that they had started the
investigation, and would get back to me within 30 days.  They did,
telling me that there was no issue with AT&T (correct), and that they
had closed their investigation.  GTEM send me a letter on the same
day, telling me the results of their investigation ...

Well, the bottom line was *of COURSE* GTEM was reselling service, and
they had carefully trained their staff to answer questions properly
about long distance service.  Lots of other waffle-words about valued
customers, and so on.  So I call GTEM up, and ask them how long
distance was handled.  The CSR assured me, as GTEM has in the past,
that "either AT&T or Sprint carries your call, whichever one is
cheaper at the time you make the call, and they will bill you for the
call.  We do not know how much a specific call will cost."  Well, if
they don't know how much it costs, how can they route the call to AT&T
or Sprint?  CSR gets upset...

So once again into the breach we go, another letter to the FCC.

Once again, the moral of the story is if you are using GTEM as your
cellular carrier, and you use *any* long distance, including
Follow-Me-Roaming, check your bill carefully.  For more information,
write to me directly, and I can put you on my fax or email list.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Dave, I hope you will keep after them
on this and send us additional followup as it becomes available to you.
I for one will be interested in how they respond to your latest note.  PAT]

Subject: COCOT Commissions
Date: 25 May 1995 03:29:47 GMT
Organization: PACS IBM SIG BBS


Strictly speaking as a consumer, I didn't even know property owners
got commissions for pay phones on their premises.  I always assumed
phones were there as a service for the customers, or so customers
wouldn't bother the business owner to use his/her phones for calls.

The moderator mentions COCOTs in poor areas.  In Philadelphia, there
are a great many COCOTS located in the city.  While Bell of Penna
always got city permission and pays all taxes and fees to put a phone
on a street corner, most COCOTs owners never did.  The city attempted
to crack down on this, and the COCOTS refused, and fought back in a
lawsuit.  (Which, IMHO, is groundless, and the city COCOTS are just
ripping the city off.)

Other COCOTS that have gotten news are those in hospitals and shopping
centers.  Basically, the owner of these properties are seeking a
higher return than they were getting from Bell, at the expense of
consumers.

Readers of this newsgroup are real quick to point out errors by the
Bell Telcos and call for honest competition.  But why aren't COCOTS
duly labeled with their charges?  There has been many newspaper
articles about people finding $5 calling card or collect charges the
next month on their bill.  That hurts!

Maybe instead of a card with fine print that only a telephone engineer
would understand, there should be a price list of fees.  Supermarkets
are required to post prices clearly, why not phone companies?  (BTW, I
tried calling 00 to get some rates from COCOTS -- next to impossible.)


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: You are obviously not reading the back
issues of this Digest or the various files in the Archives or you would
know that indeed, there have been many complaints about COCOTS presented
in this forum over the years. Telco -- or 'Genuine Bell' as we have called
them -- payphones come in two ways: either they are 'public' phones and
commisionable to the owners of the property on which they sit or they are
'semi-public' and non-commissionable with the property or business owner
where they are located paying telco a fee for keeping them there (with
telco keeping all the coins as well). If public (commissionable) then the
property/business owner gets a commission on all traffic sent paid and
all traffic received collect. He gets a set fee for all traffic billed to
calling cards or other third-party numbers. The phone cannot be listed in
the directory, and many times the phone will be set up for one way outbound
service only. 

With 'semi-public' phones it is a bit different. Telco, in their own judgment
feels the location does not warrant a 'public' payphone.  They would not put 
one there, and certainly would not pay commissions for keeping it there on 
their own. The property/business owner has agreed to not only let telco keep 
all the revenue from the phone, but to *pay an additional monthly fee as well*
for having it there, for the reason, as you point out, of convenience for his
customers. The property owner gets something else for his money though;
'semi-public' payphones can be listed in the directory as the owner's bus-
iness phone if desired; they can receive incoming calls if desired, and the
owner can have an extension installed in his office or wherever for when
the phone rings if he wants. 

Payphones located in 'public' places where the 'owner' is not readily 
apparent such as on the sidewalk on a street corner, in a park at the
shelter house, along the highway, etc. are generally assigned to the city
in which they are located. That is, the city government receives commissions
on the phone in exchange for allowing telco to clutter the sidewalk or 
the park. When in telco's judgment an outdoor, 'public' location does not
warrant a pay (commissionable) phone, and no one is willing to pay to have
one there, then various things may happen. The city may prevail on telco
to go ahead and put one there as a community service (in which case telco
itself is listed as the 'subscriber' and receives the commissions) or 
maybe the location goes without a phone, particularly if vandalism has
been a serious problem there. Because of increasing vandalism and robbery
of payphones in outdoor locations, and the increasing number of ghetto
inner city neighborhoods where telco felt their own payphones would be
a losing proposition, there was a gap to be filled, thus the COCOT came
into existence.

The COCOT people go to the places where payphones are otherwise installed
(or not installed at all) and offer to put payphones there on terms and
conditions better than the terms and conditions offered by telco for the
same thing. They offer higher commissions, or perhaps they offer commissions
in cases where telco had refused to provide public coin service at all.
So payphones (of the COCOT variety) are now available in places where it
is likely there would be no public phone at all otherwise. But someone
has to pay for the phone vandalism and the commissions they pay out. Guess
who that is ... we have had many, many, many complaints about COCOTS, and
the 'operator service bureaus' they use printed in this forum. As telco
cuts back on the payphone locations they service, the choice often times
is a COCOT or no phone at all. Which will it be?  And I may be mistaken
but I think quite a few COCOT operators have cleaned up their act quite
a bit over the past couple years. Five to ten years ago they were all
pretty outrageous. Now some are actually quite competitive with telco,
at least for the phone using public.  PAT]

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I wish the Postal Service would stick to
delivering mail and attempt to just do that much well. The postal ins-
pectors should just spend their time cleaning out the thieves who work
for the post office. Ever been in a big city post office sorting room?
If they find out you are getting money in the mail at your post office
box they'll rip you off good. Here in Chicago several years ago, a
charity known as the Missionary Fathers had a box at the same post office
I used for about twenty years. Their thing was those cheesy name and
address labels, pencils, pens and other trinkets sent to you as a gift
by the homeless Indian children in the orphanage, and won't you send 
them a gift also to help pay for their food and clothing, etc. Your
ten dollars per month will support a dozen on a diet of macaroni and
cheese, or beans, or whatever the orphanage was feeding them. The 
Missionary Fathers were pulling it in pretty well at their post office
box, and although mostly it would be checks and money orders or
credit card authorizations, a certain amount was cash stuffed in an
envelope; they got maybe a thousand dollars per day in cash. 

When they complained to the postal inspectors that their cash seemed
to be a lot less than usual, the PI's got interested and started 
watching things more closely. They 'salted' the mail, meaning they
deliberatly planted marked cash money in the mailbags for the charity
then used hidden cameras in the employees bathrooms and locker rooms.
They'd see employees grab a handful of the charity's mail, disappear
into the bathroom and come out five minutes later without the mail.
The cash in their pocket, and the remains shredded and flushed down the
toilet, etc ... in the indictment against eighteen postal workers,
the government alleged that some were double-dipping; that is, making
two trips to the bathroom on their shift, and one supervisor who got
indicted went back to the ladies room four times one day with a handful 
of Missionary Father's mail each time! 

The day the scandal broke, I went down to get my mail as always and
at the call-counter they had all different people working there. It 
seems the day before the postal inspectors had fired everyone who worked
there and brought in a new crew from one of the other post offices. 
Shortly thereafter they passed a rule saying all the workers in the
sorting room and on the loading docks had to wear a certain type of
coveralls at work that did not have any pockets in them, and that at
the end of each shift they would go to the locker room and change 
back into their street clothes under the watchful eyes of the postal
inspectors. Women employees went to a different locker room where a 
matron had the duty of checking them out. Basically, they were just
cloth sacks the employees wore to cover their nakedness while they
sorted the mail. Naturally, frequent drug testing -- and this was
in the early 1970's -- became part of the routine.

Big city post office facilities are still hell-holes to work in. It is
no wonder so many of the workers wind up shooting and killing each other
and their supervisors, etc. Are the post offices in Canada also pretty
bad places to work?  Remember that fellow working for the post office
in Toronto a few years ago who ripped off Oral Roberts for the cash
in the mail? How much was it?  $250 thousand if my memory is correct. 
The postal inspectors don't need to worry so much about child porn as
they do getting their own houses cleaned out, like they have had to 
do at zip 60690 here in Chicago a few times and 60680, the main post
office here (or 'big house' as the sorting room facilties there are
sometimes referred to by workers).    PAT]

India's telecom regulator may really be autonomous

24th May 1995: In an exclusive interview for my forthcoming newsletter
on India's information industry, Telecom Secretary R K Takkar said
that the government is "committed to treating [the yet-to-be-formed
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India] as independent and autonomous,"
and enumerated the various measures it is taking to ensure the TRAI's
independence.

First, it is trying to pass a one-line amendment to the ancient
(British) Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, to shift the powers of the
Director General of Telecommunications to the TRAI for most purposes.
This may be procedurally delayed, as the Parliament ends its current
session this week.

Second, it is working on separate legislation to formalize the TRAI as an
autonomous regulator similar to the SEBI, which monitors India's stock 
exchanges. This will be made law in a year or two, with the benefit of 
experience of the TRAI's actual performance; till then the body gets its
powers from the government's excecutive order.

Third, the three-member TRAI panel will be appointed on secure tenure for
5 years, so, like Supreme Court judges, they do not risk being removed by
an disagreeable government.

Other measures, and a discussion of the possible merger of at least the
regulatory bodies of India's communications and broadcasting ministries - 
following an earlier Supreme Court ruling against the country's government
monopoly of the airwaves - will be found in my newsletter when the sample 
issue is made available for free electronic distribution in late June.

Subject: Re: 800 1 and 800 0 - Why Not?


The question was asked, wouldn't 800 1 and 800 0 add another 20% of numbers
to the 800 database.  The answer is yes, it would.  Is it do-able?  Yes
again. 
 
This issue was raised in INC, where the concensus was that the additional
20% wouldn't solve the "shortage", so why bother. 
 
In reference to that infamous shortage, we've dug up just a few interesting
pieces of information. 
 
{CallCenter Magazine} reported in its September '94 issue that "60
million calls are made daily over the countries 1.8 million 800
numbers."
 
**** Yes folks, that's 1.8 million 800 numbers in use.  **** 
 
CallCenter got that information from the DMA (Direct Marketing
Association.) 
 
The DMA got it from AT&T.   
 
According to my sources in the DMA's public relations office, through
May '94, AT&T public relations supplied the DMA with 800 stats as well
as other mundane statistical information, on a routine basis.
 
But starting June '94, AT&T stopped giving the DMA this info; said it
didn't have it, and had no way to access the number of 800 numbers in
assignment to users. 
 
Since then, reporters have complained to me that, having asked AT&T
and MCI how many 800 numbers they have assigned to users, they were
told the carriers have no way of knowing.
 
You'd think between their resp org administrative offices, and their
billing offices, this sort of information would be easy enough to spit
out of some computer.
 
(Then again, these are the same folks who argued against "date
certain" to the U.S. ITU Delegation, asserting that they had no way of
telling who'd had their 800 assignments prior to December, '94.)
 
Back to June '94, when AT&T stopped reporting to the DMA.  This timing
just happens to coincide with two seemingly unrelated events: 500 PCS
marketing, and industry "800 shortage" claims.
 
Privately, no one even bothers to dispute that the 800 database is being
misappropriated for delivery of non-800 services that require routing. 
 
Can't be too hard to figure out either, as publications as diverse as
Catalog Age and Investor's Business Daily have recently reported on carrier
stockpiling of 800 numbers.

I do not hide behind disclaimers. It is one of the luxuries of owning
one's own site. My intimate knowledge is of Pacific Bell practices.
How they relate to other companies' policies or practices is beyond my
direct knowledge, and I wanted that understood up front. That is
hardly "hiding".  Again, my comments apply to Pac*Bell.

Cash deposits are generally not required from customers who have
substantial credit and history with telco. But 976 service was a
special case. Customers who could get banks of DID trunks, servicing
thousands of numbers, with five-year service commitments could get
such installations with a phone call. These same customers had to fork
over thousands of dollars to get so much as four 976 lines installed.

Thank you. That was my point. Pacific Bell had these practices because 

a) it could get away with them; and 

b) it wanted to place competition to its own excuse for IP services at
a disadvantage.

I would be happy to explain. Upon finding a site that significantly
met Pac*Bell's requirements for 976 service (within the arbitrary
perimeter of the serving CO, etc.,), a 976 provider could be told that
there were insufficient facilities. There could be 100 spare pairs
going into the building and the IP might only want six 976 lines, but
Pac*Bell would say that those 100 pairs were inadequate for projected
usage. It was as I said: there had to be "excess facilities", over and
beyond any anticipated usage by other customers.

With all due respect, it is you who were unaware of the doctrine of
"excess capacity". It is no secret that I have been involved with the
information providing industry for over ten years as a developer and
participant. I am well aware that the physical requirements of six 976
lines are no more nor less than the physical requirements of six POTS
lines. Requiring the cash deposit of thousands of dollars or requiring
a site to be grossly over-built is nothing more than a utility using
its position of power to screw a customer base that happens to also
represent competition.

Significantly, since Pacific Bell has decided not to play in the
information business, most of the anti-competitive practices have been
terminated. Deposits are now insignificant if not non-existent
(haven't ordered 976 for awhile). The arbitrary perimeter requirement
has been lifted, as has the "excess facility" requirement. Pac*Bell's
recharge policy is much tougher than it was -- and customers only get to
do it once.  Out of state callers have been cut off. And finally,
recharges only amount to the IP's portion of the call -- Pac*Bell eats
its own costs on every call it forgives.

I appreciate your desire to defend your employer and her sisters, but
it does not reflect well upon that defense to publicly tell major
players and pioneers in an industry that they don't know what they are
talking about.

I have an urgent need to connect a site, literally in the middle of
nowhere to the INTERNET.  The situation is rather urgent.  Money,
interestingly enough, is a secondary issue.  Who should I contact.  I
will need Satellite equipment for sure. Perhaps Radiographic
transmitters etc.  Could someone put me in contact with a company who
can provide such a facility, anywhere on earth.  The site would be
stationary, so size is not a dramatic factor.  Electricty may be.

Please help.

Subject: Meridian SL1 - Information Pointers?


        I've been working with someone locally to try and get a
Fax-On-Demand system ("single call" configuration) -- and I'm
attempting to have it as closely integrated into the existing
environment as possible.

        Our Meridian reps aren't making this easy.

        Our tech rep indicates that our "Meridian SL1 with Option 61"
can hand off an analog line.  However, I also know that we're running
some digital protocol between the PBX and our multi-line sets.  When I
inquire as to what this protocol is, he tells me "Its digital" (big
help).  This makes me worried about his information regarding the
ability to do an analog handoff.

        Additionally; I've been working with a different group here as
well and attempting to verify the configuration of the switch.  The
salescritter and tech rep claim "it can't be done".  We're looking for
some way to "map out" the configuration showing what calls should be
going where when (this is primarily to verify that the system is
configured the way that we believe it is.)  To me, this sounds like a
relatively straight-foward graphing problem.  The tough part is
getting the configuration data off the blasted machine.  Again, the
critters we have servicing us indicate that this is some hugely
complex task -- which (frankly) I just don't believe.  There's backups
 -- but it's on some seriously screwy *4MB* (yes, 4MB) 3.25" floppy.
I'd be interested also in finding out where I could get one of these
drives.

        Any pointers to information would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Review -- FCC Docket # 91-281: Caller ID


The requirement that Caller ID be delivered on all long distance calls
by April 12 1995 was stayed by the FCC because of opposition on two
primary points.

1.  Some states mandate per-line Caller ID blocking, some don't.  The
FCC had ruled that only per-call Caller ID blocking be allowed on
interstate calls.  It is technically unfeasible to have per-line
blocking within a state, but not on on interstate calls on the same
line.  California mandates that all unlisted numbers (44% of
California numbers are unlisted) be automatically per-line blocked by
default.

2. The long distance companies objected to being obliged to transport Caller
ID without compensation.

On May 4, the FCC released a new Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that
addressed these two issues, and set a new date, December 1, 1995 for
mandatory interstate transport of CalIer ID on all SS7 systems capable
of such transport.

The new Notice resolves the above issues in a fair and reasonable manner:  

1. Where states allow per line call blocking, those blocked lines will
be blocked for all calls, inter and intra state.  Any unblocked line
can be blocked for a single call by dialing *67 before the destination
number.  Any per-line blocked line can be unblocked for a single call
by dialing *82 before the destination number.  Dialing *67 on an
already blocked line will yield a fast busy signal.  No line (even in
California) is to be per-line blocked unless the subscriber specifically 
requests it.  Having an unlisted number is not considered to be such a
request.

2. The long distance companies must transport Caller ID without
compensation.  The reasoning here is that if they have SS7 it doesn't
cost them anything, and in any case if they charge the LEC's for
transporting Caller ID on an inbound call, the LEC's will in turn
charge them for providing the Caller ID on an outbound call.  It is
unlikely that the LEC's will charge the IXC's less for Caller ID than
the IXC's charge them, so it would be a wash anyway!

This ruling appears to be a big win for all telephone users, since many new
and useful services will be enabled by this technology.  

There are many peripheral points in the ruling, including issues of
caller ID blocking to emergency numbers, on payphones, on PBX's, on
cellular phones, from hotels, and from various kinds of spousal abuse
shelters.  The ruling also requires that other CID based services,
such as last number callback, be blocked for anonymous callers.  The
ruling also talks about ANI, and mandates restrictions on the use of
ANI information.  The ruling requires number delivery only, and does
not require Calling Name Delivery.

Caller ID is kind of like the little peephole that you have in your
front door to see who is there before you open it.  People who block
Caller ID are like people who stick their thumbs over the peephole
before they ring the bell so you can't see who is there.  For those
who would not open their door to a person blocking the peephole, there
is an excellent service available from all LEC's called 'Anonymous
Call Rejection.'  If you subscribe to this service, callers who block
their Caller ID when they call you are routed to a recording saying
that your number does not accept anonymous calls.  Your phone never
rings.

By the way, some countries are ahead of the USA on this technology.  I
called Germany from Washington DC a couple of weeks ago, and my number
was delivered internationally!

In your reply to my article, you asked why the engineer at the station
in North Carolina was hearing the same program material at his board,
with his station off the air, as you were in Chicago. My only
conclusion would be both stations were receiving the same network feed
at the same time.  I suspect this was quite some time ago,before
putting program feeds on satelite which would certainly limit the
number of available feeds.  Did you check the affiliation of the
station in North Carolina, by chance?
 
I would say this is why both places in the country had common programs when
you made your phone call.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: No, I did not specifically inquire if the
program on WBBM was being fed to the network, but I seriously doubt that
it was; it was a locally originated discussion program airing in the 
middle of the night. Anyway, I don't think the station in North Carolina
was a CBS affiliate.  Good point though.    PAT]

If the antennas of the two radio stations were *very* close, and if
there was any significantly large metal object in somewhat poor repair
near both antennas (and I've heard of BC antenna farms that looked
like scrap metal dumps), then a rusty joint could easily act as a
crude diode, which would then act as an RF mixer to combine the two
signals, generate the 2A-B mixing product, and then reradiate it.  I
wouldn't expect that to generate more than a couple of watts, even if
located very close to two high-power transmitters, but if propagation
was just right, the NC engineer could have heard the signal if the
channel was otherwise quiet.  (Unless the engineer was using a very
sensitive receiver, in which case good propagation could have resulted
in local generation of the spurious signal -- 2A-B calculates out to
the same result regardless of where you are.  Were there any stations
on the two real channels in his area?  If so, he would have been
likely to hear *them* mixing, not the Chicago stations.)


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Quite a few years ago when we had a 
local, daytime only station here on 820 called WAIT, they would always
go off the air at sundown, meaning in the winter as early as 4:30 pm
some days and during the summer as late as 8:30 pm. It was always fun
to catch them just as they were going off the air for the day since 
the second they powered down the transmitter a station from Toronto,
Ontario (might have been CJR, not sure) would come booming in like
gangbusters, loud and clear right on the same spot.  

I think I mentioned the two neighborhood kids here who got me to fix
them up with an old tube radio that I had diddled with the IF on so it
could be heard around the neighborhood with a little luck. They were
back the other day, *pulling in a wagon* an old floor model Philco
radio from about 1930. They had got it for a few dollars out of
someone's garage sale. Since the cord had a short in it and the
lightbulb over the tuning dial was burned out the original owners
assumed it was unusable. I replaced the cord and the lightbulb, cleaned
it up a little, dusted the insides out good and checked all the tubes.
It worked just fine, and some of the tubes were new, or never used.
We turned it on and got quite a few local stations. Those old floor
model radios had great big speakers in them which made them sound
great, just like Grundigs. But I said, "kids! you want to really hear
this radio talking? ..." I got in the back and clipped onto the antenna
leads with about fifty feet of wire which we strung out the window and
along the side of my house. We came back inside and that radio was
screaming. With its big huge tuning dial, stations all over the USA were
easy to hear. I told them you wait until later on tonight, or maybe
late on a hot summer night in August and turn this on. You haven't heard
anything yet. Of course it had no FM, but it had four shortwave bands
plus AM. The AM band was numbered up to 1750 kc of all things, and
the area from 1650 to 1750 was labeled 'police'. They thought that was
pretty funny and I explained that fifty or sixty years ago police used
*one way* broadcast stations around that range in their cars. The
police dispatchers would make announcements but that's all, and the 
police would then drive to wherever they heard mentioned on the radio. 
I helped them load it back in their little wagon and they took it home.
I hope their parents let them keep it to play with.   PAT]

This should not be hard to find; many schools have similar set-ups.  All 22
high schools in the San Jose Unifed School District and the East Side Union
High School District (both in San Jose, CA) have auto dialing systems
connected to their attendance systems.

The physical box is located at each campus, so it can't be too expensive,
but I'm sure that *ANY* kind of system is going to cost you a lot more than
$70.  I think that $1000 to $4000 might be more accurate.

The attendance dialer setup is actually quite interesting: the
teachers have ScanTron sheets printed for each class with each
student's name.  They mark absent/tardy/etc. and the sheets get
scanned right after school ends.  Around four o'clock, the computer
system starts calling the homes of absent students.  The message is
English, Spanish, Vietnamese, or Filipino depending on the what
language is spoken at home (the computer has a record of the language
and just passes a code to the dialer).

It has apparently save the school district quite a bit of money,
because it used to take a staff person 6 hours a day just to let
parents know their child wasn't in school.  Also, attendance increased
around 5% and the schools were able to recover the cost of the
equipment many times over in state funding (California funds schools
by the number of days each student is in attendance).

I just read in this week's {PC Magazine} that Creative Lab's new Phone
Blaster card will do what you want.  They had a review of a bunch of
inexpensive voice mail type systems.

It seemed like it said that it might not be out yet, but I'm not sure.

So David says, basically, 'No'.  Or at least not for less than $2k -
$10k.

I think you are over engineering the solution.  This is for a school.
Most of the numbers that the kids have are POTS lines, nothing fancy
like pagers and the like.  Answering machines need to be dealt with,
true.  But generally the particular population might really benefit
from a cheap, somewhat reliable system, rather than no system.

Why not simply call through the list, playing the message on offhook,
repeating the message until (a) the line is released or (b) 90 seconds
has elapsed?  If a person gets it, they listen to it, or have some
time to call Mom over to the phone to hear the message.  If its an
answering machine, they get 90 seconds of the message (minus the time
for the OGM) on the tape.  Should be pretty simple for the system to
track busy/no answer and call those numbers back.

I'm not suggesting this is a bulletproof system.  Far from it.  But
the requirements don't seem to call for one.  If this user population
knows about the system, it will work even better because parents will
be hanging by waiting for the call to hear soccer is cancelled because
of rain.  This kind of simple system could be built on a Mac, and I'm
guessing an Intel processor as well.  For not much money, and a little
development time.

The value of any property depends upon supply and demand. If all
spectrum were suddenly put up for auction, the supply would suddenly
be in excess of the demand. The result is that the value of the
spectrum would fall until the price met the demand. Therefore, figures
determined by multiplying the price of today's "scarce" commodity into
infinity are appealing to justify a massive spectrum auction -- but the
actual earnings are likely to be considerably less. Indeed, some
prognasticators believe a lot of PCS buyers will be broke in five years
and excess spectrum will go for sale at reduced prices.

One advantage of assigning a $ value to a piece of spectrum is that
the spectrum may be used more efficiently.  Why spend billions for
more MHz if converting to the latest whizbang digital thingamajigger
will increase the effective bandwidth?The effect of deploying better
technology is to create "virtual spectrum". And it may very well be
cheaper to deploy technology than to buy spectrum. If, for example,
CDMA enables a 10x capacity improvement for a given service, then we
create have an excess of virtual spectrum. (What was once 1 MHz
becomes equivalent to today's 10 MHz slice -- kind of like multiplying
all spectrum by a factor of 10).

Spectrum auctions state that the *only* valid use of radio spectrum is
that which makes money. Any other use is not essential. But there are
bonafide uses of the spectrum that are not measured (or easily
measured) in a strict dollar value. For example, suppose we auction
the marine frequencies and the cost of putting a two-way radio on a
boat increases substantially to pay for the marine channels -- leading
to people not putting radios on boats and decreasing the safety of the
marine environment (I live near Puget Sound...). You push in on one
side of the balloon and the cost pops out somewhere else. How about
aviation? What about Amateur Radio and public access services?

We currently have no experiencing selling spectrum for anything but
cellular/PCS-like services. We need to move slowly to understand the
impact and determine if such impacts are truly what we want. The last
thing we want is to, say, auction the marine frequencies, then turn
around and from a government subsidy program to ensure equal access to
marine safety communications.

Subject: Troubles With NYNEX Voice Mail?


I've heard of and experienced some problems with Nynex's c.o. based
voice mail.  I called someone yesterday (5/25) and when they didn't
pick up I heard "You have reached the Nynex message center.  Please
enter the phone phone number of the person you are calling ..."
Eventually I heard their greeting and was able to leave a message.
This same person has told me that she has called other Nynex voice
mail subscribers and instead of getting their greeting heard the
subscriber menu for picking up messages.

Does anyone know what is going on?  Anyone out there from Nynex that
can shed some light?


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Supposedly your call goes in to voicemail
on a DID trunk which shows who was being called in order to come up with
the appropriate answer phrase or greeting. I think sometimes the system
fails for whatever reason and voicemail does not know who is calling whom,
so it has to ask you. 

People with telco voicemail might also try this little trick and see
what happens:  have you noticed how when you dial into the main number
using the phone number assigned it does not ask you to enter your mail-
box number? It already knows who you are, and just asks for your pass-
word. Now try calling the main number but using *67 first ... does it
still know who you are and merely ask for your password, or do you get
the introductory part about 'please enter the number of the mailbox you
are calling."  I am told in some telcos they say to heck with that *67
business on calls to them; the privacy flag is ignored when you call
into a telco function such as voicemail. How does it work in your
community?    PAT]

I purchased a Northern 61C Meridian system loaded with Meridian mail,
IVR, CCR, ACD, Meridian MAX, and Meridian Link. For six months I have
had the worst service and support through Nortel.  Has anyone else had
the same problem?  I came from a 12 year ROLM background so I have
nothing to compare this too.  I can't figure out if my frustration
lies within Nortel's organization, or if Northern just isn't the
technological giant it markets itself to be?

Any feedback and/or recommendations on an alternative service provider
would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Need One Mile PC Communications
Date: 25 May 1995 16:16:01 GMT


We're using reachout between two PCs, but the nominal 9600-28K baud
rates available between the machines is not quite fast enough for the
customers needs. However, the machines are one mile apart, and the
customer is willing to string his own wire if necessary to gain
thruput.  Unfortunately, high speed phone lines are simply not
available in this area. But it seems to me that a mile is not too far
fetched for the right kind of direct connection. If anyone is
familliar enough with the possible off the shelf solutions, please
email me. 


Thanks in advance.

On May 4, 1995, the Oregon PUB approved a new area code plan.  On the
original PUC list of exchanges, the Stayton exchange was inadvertently
included on both the 503 and 541 area code lists.  Stayton is assigned
to the 503 area code.

In addition, the Independence-Monmouth exchange was originally listed
on the 503 list under the name "Independence" using the industry
terminology.  In order to avoid customer confusion, the name
"Monmouth" has been added to the 503 list.

  *******************************************************

MCI and Murdoch: alliance of giants
-----------------------------------
MCI is to invest $2bn, the equivalent of a 13.5% stake, in Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp over the next four years in a global joint
venture, with MCI providing the means of distribution and News
Corp providing content. Previous attempts to marry telecoms and
entertainment have come unstuck, with last year's failed merger
of Bell Atlantic and TCI being the most spectacular example. 

News Corp's assets include extensive film, TV and publishing
interests. MCI, the US' second largest long distance carrier, has
pioneered mass Internet access. At the moment, the companies are
giving no details of exactly what services they plan to offer,
but say they are likely to be business information orientated,
rather than consumer entertainment. 

Apparently services will begin this year. Last-mile delivery
mechanisms will include satellite receivers, radio and cable TV
networks. BT, which owns 20% of MCI, has professed itself pleased
to be involved in such an enterprise, even at one remove.  It has
long argued against the government policy which prevents it from
providing broadcast services in the UK, in order to protect the
fledgling cable TV companies until the next century. MCI's
alliance with News Corp is likely to help Murdoch in his US
regulatory struggle over his ownership of Fox TV.

BSkyB comes down to earth for cable
-----------------------------------
Two of the UK's largest cable TV operators, Nynex CableComms and
TeleWest Communications, have agreed to carry BSkyB's nine
channels and the pay per view channel it plans to launch later
this year. They reserve the right to launch their own channels if
they wish and to transmit whatever programmes they wish. At least
for these two companies for the moment, it will bring to an end
the acrimony that exists between BSkyB and the cable operators.

Fighting phone fraud
--------------------
The UK's four cellular operators (Vodafone, Cellnet, One2One and
Orange) have joined forces with handset manufacturers and service
providers in an attempt to stamp out fraud - which costs the UK
industry UKP50m annually. 

The four operators have stumped up UKP650,000 to set up a team of
undercover investigators to catch dishonest dealers who connect
stolen mobile phones to the networks, signalling their willing-
ness to do so, with slogans like `Previous history no problem'. 

Swedes fail to make turnips out of BT
-------------------------------------
Telia, the Swedish state-owned operator, has failed to keep a
consortium headed by BT out of its domestic market. BT's partners
are Tele Danmark and Telenor of Norway; their joint company is to
be called Telenordia and they will own and fund it equally. 

Telia appealed to the EU to block the venture on the grounds that
the Danish and Norwegian markets are closed to competition, but
the Commission dismissed the complaint. Such judgements are
becoming increasingly complex; Telia is one of the founding
partners of the Unisource consortium which is becoming more
closely affiliated to AT&T and its would-be world-domination
vehicle, WorldPartners. Needless to say, they view BT and its
global joint venture with MCI, Concert, as their greatest rival. 

Telenordia has already said it will spend US$276m in the attempt
to capture 10% of the Swedish market by the end of the century.
Existing Tele Danmark and BT business will be taken over by
Telenordia and while Concert will offer Swedish corporations
worldwide data and voice services, the new company is to focus on
intra-nordic region traffic which amounts to half of Sweden's
international traffic. In Sweden Telenordia will offer closed
user group voice and data transmission as well as PSTN services.

A tactical error by BT?
-----------------------
BT could regret involving the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
(MMC) in its dispute with Oftel over who should bear the cost of
implementing number portability (see TN8). The Government is
coming under growing pressure to strengthen competition law,
making consumers' welfare the primary concern. This goal could
lead to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the MMC being merged
into a single organisation, a step backed by the outgoing
Director General of the OFT, Sir Bryan Carsberg.

The Labour Party has added its support to the cause of stiffening
competition law and it is an open secret that Sir Bryan, who is
leaving OFT half-way through his five year term of office, is
exasperated by the Government's neglect of competition policy
since Mr Michael Heseltine took charge of the DTI in 1992.

Sir Bryan, the first Director General of Oftel, says UK compet-
ition law lacks teeth, with no rules banning anti- competitive
agreements and no means to enforce what little competition law we
have. The UK and the Netherlands are the only countries not to
have adopted rules based on articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty. 

These prohibit price fixing and market-sharing agreements, abuses
of market power by monopolies and impose fines of up to 10% of
worldwide turnover for offenders. No wonder these have not been
taken up in the UK; some of the cornerstones of telecoms policy
would have to go immediately including the RPI-7.5% price cap
fixed by Oftel on BT and the apportioning of access deficit cont-
ribution charges if BT slips to less than an 85% market share.

==> TN wonders... what if someone objects to an OFT/MMC merger? 
==> Where would the matter be referred?  

Telecoms middleware - TINA paves the way
----------------------------------------
The telecoms industry is a step closer to a standard architect-
ure for services and management software, with the launch of
telecoms-specific middleware which merges distributed computing
with telecoms.
 
In July 1995, Hewlett-Packard will ship a middleware product
based on Bellcore's Information Networking Architecture (INA)
framework.  It will be a first step towards the specifications
from the ambitious TINA-C (Telecommunications Industry Networking
Architecture Consortium) as they are published.
 
TINA-C is a coalition of service providers and suppliers aiming
to produce an open, next generation architecture for telecoms by
1997. HP is a member (represented by HP LABs, Bristol), alongside
40 other leading companies including AT&T, IBM, Digital, NEC,
Fujitsu, NT, Ericsson, Siemens, Alcatel, Nokia, NTT, BT and
France Telecom.  TINA's work is being done at Bellcore in New
Jersey, where INA was developed. 
 
Both TINA and INA include a software backplane for applications
to plug into, called the Distributed Processing Environment
(DPE), and based on distributed object technologies such as the
Object Management Group's CORBA and the Open Software
Foundation's DCE. Bellcore showed its prototype earlier this year
with sample ATM applications; HP's product will also include
OpenView DM. HP, Bellcore and other ISVs are working on
applications which use DPE. TINA and INA are well grounded in the
standards world: they refer to the ITU's Telecommunications
Management Network (TMN), ISO's reference model for open
distributed processing (RM-ODP), Intelligent Network (IN), and
Network Management Forum work. 
 
Italians help Mercury take flight again
---------------------------------------
An Italian company, Industria Politecnica Meridonale looks set to
take over Mercury Communications' 2,873 public payphone sites,
for an undisclosed price. Divesting itself of payphones was part
of the cost cutting plan set out last December, after Mercury's
interim results revealed falling profits despite growing revenue.
 
The Italian firm makes telephone equipment in Naples and operates
around 200,000 payphones in Italy. It is awaiting a licence from
the DTI to operate payphones. Unlike Mercury's card-only phones,
the new Italian payphones will take cards and coins.

To add insult to injury for Mercury, BT's Patricia Vaz has been
named Veuve Cliquot Businesswoman of the Year. Her achievement?
Turning BT's payphone business from running at a 46m loss in 1990
when she was put in charge of it to making a 74m profit in
1993-94. She also radically increased their reliability and upped
the number of BT payphones nationwide from 97,000 to 130,000.

The last thing Mercury needs is Analysys
----------------------------------------
Consultancy Analysys reckons that for UK residential customers
and businesses with fewer than six lines cable operators and BT
are cheaper than Mercury. 

Apparently for those with more than 12 lines, Mercury is still
more economic. Analysys' conclusion was reached via calculations
of average line costs for most European carriers. Mercury
commented that the definition of an average customer could be
misleading; its business has never been in the provision of local
telephony nor for very low volume users.

Hey, big spender
----------------
BT invests more money in technology than any other UK business
according to a survey conducted by Corporate IT Strategy
magazine. It spent almost UKP580m last year, UKP200m more than
the second largest IT spender, GEC. British Gas came third with
UKP313m. However, Reuters was streets ahead of everyone else in
terms of the percentage of turnover spent on technology; it
invests over 10%. On this scale, BT came seventh, at 4.4%.

HP in Franco-German ATM and German GSM 
--------------------------------------
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom will use HP's OpenView DM to
manage their common ATM network, using extensions from Debis
Systemhaus, Germany, and CAP SESA, France. Meanwhile DeTeMobil,
Deutsche Telekom's subsidiary and Germany's largest mobile
network operator, is to run the geographical information systems
used for planning its GSM network, and some customer care system,
on HP systems.  The deal may eventually be worth around $3.5
million.  

==> Not surprisingly, HP's UK manufacturing divisions won a
Queen's Award for Export Achievement in 1995.  With UKP 445
million in 1994, the company is the UK's 39th largest exporter. 
 
Drenched RBOC upgrades
----------------------
Meanwhile, in the US, AT&T keeps its finger in the RBOCs' pie by
selling them IT systems... and those systems use Hewlett-Packard
equipment. At US West, HP delivered two systems overnight, when the
RBOC's legacy loop management systems were overloaded by high service
call-outs due to rain - and won an order for eight more machines.
Another deal at Pacific Bell, for systems to supporvideo, could be
worth $15 million.

Operators count the cost of phone tapping
-----------------------------------------
A row has erupted in Germany between the government and mobile phone
network operators after operators were told to modify their systems so
that the police could eavesdrop on criminals. It is likely to cost the
operators - Deutsche Telekom, MannesmanMobilfunk and E-Plus - a total
of about UKP114m to change their digital networks to comply. They
argue they should not have to pay, as the civil service should have
made official eavesdropping a condition of the licences it awarded in
1989.

Hutchison to provide 200 jobs
-----------------------------
Hutchison Telecom is to create 200 jobs in a UKP3m expansion of its
Darlington-based HQ which is to be the main base for customer service
operations for the Orange PCN and paging services.

HP wins the Cup
---------------
Hewlett-Packard is over the moon to have wrested the prized World
Cup IT deal from Sun Microsystems. TV coverage of the 1998 Cup,
held in France and watched by 37 million people, will feature
HP's name. Soccer enthusiast HP announced earlier this year plans
to sponsor Tottenham Hotspur from the 1995/6 season. But will
this be enough to make up for the loss of Jurgen Klinsman?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: You are of course correct, and so was I
in my original statement. The war did begin in 1939, but the United
States did not get involved until Sunday, December 7, 1941 following the 
attack in Hawaii. There are a number of theories behind the attack which 
thrust us into the war; those are best left for other forums. All I will
say here is that President Roosevelt was just *itching* to get into it
right from the beginning, but he had no valid excuse for sticking his nose
where it did not belong until that Sunday morning ... FDR wanted to get
in the war so badly he could taste it. A good war works wonders for the
economy you know.   PAT]

Would like to suggest the book "Empire of the Air" (also a
documentary) for a slightly biased account of early radio in the US.
Have to take some of it with a grain of salt (few items I knew about
did not jibe, for instance had Cmdr. McDonald holding up adoption of
color TV by Zenith until 1961 -- neat trick since he died in 1958).

> (Of course the station is now WUSN -- I wonder what Commander

Probably not much, the "Commander" was a Navy rank earned in WW1 and
the Naval excursion of 1924 played a big part in making Zenith a success.


Warmly,

Padgett

PS: amazing the overlaps on the net - I also collect Zenith TransOceanics.
PPS: of course it took two years and some intense lobbying, but Sarnoff did
    make "General" so outranked both McDonald and Armstrong.

        ----- and now back to telecom -----

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Oh indeed, Zenith made out like bandits
during the Second War as well; so did all of the defense contractors
including RCA, and I might add, Western Electric/AT&T. The manufacture
of telephone instruments was suspended from 1942 through early in 1946
when Western Electric 'went to war'. There was such a shortage of phone
instruments during that time that if you had an extension phone in your
house the patriotic thing to do when the phone company called on you
was to give it up in order that the instrument might be used to provide
service for other people who had could not obtain a phone instrument at
all. Lots of people gave their extension phones back to telco so that
needy subscribers could be serviced while Western Electric was unavailable
due to wartime production for the armed forces.

That is one of the reasons it took so long to get Chicago converted from
manual service (beginning in 1939) to completely dial service (in 1951).
About one third of the city was coverted to automatic dialing when the
USA got into WW-2 and the government seized Western Electric for its own
requirements.  Once the war ended Western Electric was allowed to resume
normal manufacturing for AT&T beginning early in 1946. 

It is worth noting also that during WW-2, military personnel were given
priority status on AT&T long distance circuits. If all circuits from
point A to B were busy and a military commander (as an example) needed
to make a call, the operator would select a trunk -- yours, or whoever
she saw first -- and tell you, 'sorry, line is needed for priority call
in the war effort.'  Then she pulled the cords down and that was that.

Also, telephone books and other advertising by AT&T warned against the
use of the telephone to discuss military secrets. For example your 
son or husband was in the military, off in Germany or the UK or the
South Pacific or the North Atlantic or wherever. Finally you got word
that he would be able to speak with you on the phone at a certain time,
and the AT&T operator would put the call through while the whole family
waited anxiously by the phone, each one wanting to get at least a few
seconds of conversation in with their father, their brother, husband
or whatever. But the AT&T ads in the newspapers and the phone directories
plainly warned, "Loose lips sink ships. When conversing with a military
person on the telephone, please do not ask him to compromise our nation's
security by discussing military secrets to which he may have knowledge.
There may be so much he wants to tell you, but cannot, because of the
war, and you never know when the telephone lines may have been sabatoged
by the enemy ....'.   (From {Chicago Tribune} AT&T advertisement, 1944).

Subject: Telecom History


Pat,

I have a question that is somewhat tangential to the serious telecom
discussions usually found here for the telecom historians or veterans.

Last weekend I was at a yardsale and while poking through the piles of
books found one titled "Principles of Electricity applied to Telephone
and Telegraph Work 1953 Edition". Scanning through it briefly, I found
some intresting photos and diagrams of cross bar and step by step
switches. And at $1 it was a deal I could not pass up.

Later upon closer examination, it turns out to be "A Training Course
Text Prepared for Employees of the Long Lines Department, American
Telegraph and Telephone Company, January 1953" being a revision to a
1938 edition.

My question is this: The frontispiece is a photo of a statue labeled
"Spirit of Communication". The statue is a winged nude male in the
classic roman style holding up 3 lightning bolts in his left hand and
holding the end of a thick cable in his right hand. This cable is
coiled around his arm and midriff providing "some" modesty. Does
anybody know the origin or location of this statue and where it is
today?

PS. This book has a couple of paragraphs about transisters, pulse code
modulation and todays T carriers (though not named as such in the
book.)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It was -- still is? -- at the AT&T
Building on Broadway in lower Manhattan.  A picture of that statue
was also the standard back cover of Bell System telephone directories
for many years, and quite a few business offices, including the one
in downtown Chicago had replicas of it. The phone books always had
that statue on the cover somewhere, along with the little circle and
the words 'American Telephone and Telegraph and Associated Companies'
in the circle.  I guess they quit using the statue about 1960.   PAT]

A bit misleading -- for your data calls, it's not the central office

The featured article from the May 16 issue of BROADBAND NETWORKING NEWS 
looks at combinations of cable and phone companies. Here is an excerpt from 
"ALLIANCE TARGETS BROADBAND INTERNET SOLUTION."
            
                   --------------------------

     Thanks to a new solution being developed by AT&T Network Systems,
Intel Corporation, and Hybrid Networks Inc., local cable and phone
companies are one step closer to offering Internet access -- and to
bypassing traditional Internet service providers (ISPs).  The joint
solution will enable consumers to access the Internet at speeds up to
27 Mbps from their home computers, while allowing telcos and cable
companies to offer another new service over their growing broadband
networks.

     "Online access is a rapidly growing area," said Stan Holcomb,
director of business strategy for visual consumer broadband networks
for AT&T Network Systems.  "We hope to bring [cable and phone]
companies into this growing market.  This will bring service providers
a new revenue source -- PC-based services.  These services will
especially be important for Internet access and for work-at-home
applications."  

     "We think there is a big market in bringing broadband to PCs,"
said Tom Waldrop, an Intel spokesman.  "We think the PC -- not the
television -- will be the consumers' choice for interactive data
services like Internet, work-at-home, education, and news."

     
 ...Creating the Service

     AT&T will integrate the Internet solution into both of its
broadband networking systems -- the HFC-2000 Broadband Access System,
a hybrid fiber-coax solution, and the SLC-2000 Access System with FLX
Switched Digital Video, a fiber-to-the curb, switched video solution.
AT&T is developing the latter system jointly with BroadBand
Technologies (see BNN, October 18, 1994).

     Both systems incorporate AT&T's GlobeView 2000 ATM switch as a
central component, and AT&T is installing both around the country. 
Southwestern Bell has deployed the SLC-2000 with FLX Switched Digital
Video in Richardson, Texas, while Pacific Bell is using the HFC-2000
solution in California.  Southern New England Telephone and Comcast
Cable are also deploying the HFC-2000, and Bell Atlantic is using both
broadband systems.

     Although running TCP/IP over ATM has been troublesome, AT&T's
Holcomb says the problems of running the protocol over its networking
solutions have been solved, and the systems have been tested.  AT&T
plans to introduce additional, related networking products over the
next 12 months.

     Hybrid Networks will integrate its point-of-presence network hubs
into the broadband solution.  The hubs are used to link the Internet
and other multimedia content providers to broadband networks.   

     For its part in the solution, Intel will provide the CablePort
adapter technology needed to connect PCs to cable networks.  The
products, which are still being tested, will include a card that goes
inside a PC and an external module that connects the computer to the
cable.  Both Viacom and Comcast Cable have been testing the
technologies.  In the test, each firm is providing access to online
service providers and the Internet as well as additional programming
such as home shopping.  Intel expects to introduce the products later
this year.

     According to both Holcomb and Waldrop, local cable and phone
companies will be able to install the solution and begin offering
Internet access by year's end.  They don't, however, expect the
solution to become widespread until the end of 1996.

 Education and Technology Groups Rally to Ensure Access for School
and Libraries in Pending Telecommunications Reform Bill
  
 Contact: Michelle Richards of the National School Boards
          Association, 703-838-6208

   WASHINGTON, May 25 -- A broad-based, non-partisan coalition of more
than 40 organizations has joined to rally support for provisions of
the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 that
assure the nation's schools and students receive universal and
affordable access to emerging telecommunications and information
services.

   The provisions for school and library access, co-sponsored by U.S.
Senators Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), J.
Robert Kerrey (D-Neb.), and J. James Exon (D-Neb.), are expected to be
the focus of heated debate in the Senate which is scheduled to take up
consideration of the bill over the next few weeks.

   The coalition is working to protect language in the Senate bill
that ensures all children will have an affordable "on-ramp" to the
Information Highway by providing the nation's schools and libraries
with universal and reasonably-priced access to telecommunications and
information services.

   Opposition to the provision has been raised by those who believe
that competition alone should result in affordable access without the
necessity for specific assurances.  The coalition counters that,
especially in rural areas, competition will be insufficient to lower
rates.  Schools and libraries are not asking for a "free ride," just
affordability.  Since schools and libraries are public service
institutions rather than commercial markets, it is in the public
interest to assure such affordable access.

   The coalition is also encouraging leaders in the U.S. House of
Representatives to include a similar provision in its version of the
telecommunication bill, H.R. 1555.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: And it *is* possible for libraries and
schools to get online inexpensively. A lot of equipment is *not* needed;
extensive telecom equipment is *not* needed. What often times are needed
are terminals, printers and modems to provide the most elementary access
and in effect the only access needed by many small institutions. Yes, more
would be useful, but is not needed. I have said many times that if I were
to win the Illinois State Lottery and a couple million dollars I would
see to it that every small library in the Chicago area and school got at
least the minimum basics needed to use the Internet. There is some outfit
now trying to sell the Chicago Public Schools a massive, millions-of-dollars
comptuter network for the same purpose; it will be a ripoff! Politicians
and bureaucrats trying to figure out how the Internet works and squandering
all their money in the process. Did you know that with even a small, used
386 you can operate a small site with accomodations for a couple dozen
users, newsgroups, email, etc? For the longest time, I have wanted to see
a Freenet in operation here for the libraries and schools in Chicago where
such a thing is badly needed. People would be amazed how much can be done
with very little expense *if they know how to do it*. Now I am not suggesting
a Freenet can be run on a 386; but I am saying lots of small sites for use
by library patrons could be established with a lot less money than they
think, if dedicated and knowledgeable netters would assist in setting them
up. The trouble is -- and here shows up my cynicism of government, politi-
cians and bureaucrats in general -- they probably won't ask any of us for
help. They'll stumble along, somehow millions of dollars later manage to
get connected, then a lot of the equipment will set unused because people
do not know how to operate it.  I only wish I were in a position to do
something about it. Somedays I feel so helpless here, seeing how much needs
to be done to truly bring America on line ...  PAT]

   WASHINGTON, May 25 -- In a statement delivered to reporters today
in Washington, Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe, president of The U.S.
Conference of Mayors, called on Congress to respect local governments'
right to manage the use of their roads and streets and to be
compensated for their use when telecommunications companies install
their communications networks.

   Ashe also asserted that local governments should not lose their
very basic police power -- zoning -- in the name of launching new
technologies.  "We can't let companies, in the name of expediency,
simply sweep our community interests and needs to the side," said
Ashe.  "And we can't let Congress and the Federal Communications
Commission pretend that they are in the zoning business or that they
are the local utilities board."

   Noting that the House Commerce Committee was marking up new
telecommunications legislation at that moment, Ashe described
mayors' concerns that, in the name of building the information
superhighway, commercial interests were seeking legislation to
preempt what traditionally have been local authorities.  "Efforts
have been made to compromise our property rights; efforts have been
made to devalue the compensation we receive for the use of local
property; more recently, some are trying to avoid local zoning,"
Ashe explained.

   Because the fiberoptic cable and conduit networks needed to
support new telecommunication systems will share space with other
occupants of cities' rights-of-way -- gas companies, sewer and
water utilities, electric companies and existing telecommunication
providers -- mayors anticipate costly problems for local
governments in accommodating the overlay of these new networks.
"To suggest that the Congress and the Federal Communications
Commission can manage the rules, resolve the conflicts and protect
local community interests is simply foolhardy," said Ashe.

   An amendment to the Communications Act of 1995 which addresses
the mayors' right-of-way concerns had been offered by Rep. Bart
Stupak (Mich.).  While the amendment was not acted upon, Commerce
Committee Chair Thomas Bliley (Va.), a former mayor, indicated
today that the mayors' concerns would be addressed as the
legislation moves toward full House consideration.

Subject: How to Make a Long Distance Call in 1942


In my hobby of listening to Old Time Radio programs, I came across
this gem which I've transcribed below, which gives a fascinating
insight into what it took to make a long-distance phone call in 1942.

This is an episode of the dramatic series "Suspense". This particular
broadcast occurred on September 2, 1942, starring Orson Welles and
entitled "The Hitchhiker". Welles plays a man named Ronald Adams, who
is traveling alone cross-country in his car, and as the story
progresses, he is becoming increasingly tormented by a mysterious
figure he keeps encountering along the way, usually along the side of
the road. At a tense and dramatic point near the end, he decides to
call his mother in Brooklyn, New York from a payphone in Gallup, New
Mexico, several thousand miles to the west. Note that the complexity
of making the call has nothing to do with the story; it's just
presented as how things were routinely done. PAT, feel free to jump in
and clarify, if you can, why it takes at least four operators working
in sequence to pull this off:

(Adams deposits a coin and waits)

OPERATOR #1: Your call, please...

ADAMS: Long distance. 

OPERATOR #1: Long distance... certainly...

(a buzzer is heard on the line...)

OPERATOR #2: This is Long Distance...

ADAMS: I'd like-- *cough* *cough* (louder now:) I'd like to put in a
call to my home in Brooklyn, New York... I'm Ronald Adams... um, er,
the number is BEechwood two, oh eight two eight.

OPERATOR #2: Certainly; I will try to get it for you...

(another buzzer, fainter this time)

OPERATOR #3: Albuquerque...

OPERATOR #2: New York, for Gallup...

(two faint electronic beeps heard on the line)

OPERATOR #4: New York...

OPERATOR #2: Gallup, New Mexico calling BEechwood two, oh eight
two eight.

ADAMS: (talking quietly to himself:) I read somewhere that love
could banish demons...

(his payphone abruptly swallows the first coin into its box)

 ... it was the middle of the morning ... I knew mother'd be home...
I pictured her, tall and white-haired, in her crisp house dress, going
about her tasks. It'd be enough, I thought, just to hear the even
calmness of her voice--

OPERATOR #1: (brisk, sing-song businesslike voice) Will you please
deposit three dollars and eighty-five cents for the first three
minutes? When you have deposited a dollar and a half, will you wait
until I have collected the money ...

(we hear six quarters go in one at a time, each striking the heavy
bell inside the phone. After the sixth quarter, we hear a slight
avalanche of coins falling inside the phone.)

OPERATOR #1: (more sing-song business script:) All right, deposit 
another dollar and a half ...

(six more clangs and an avalanche)

OPERATOR #1: Will you please deposit the remaining eighty-five cents ...

(three more clangs, then a ringy-ding from a dime)

OPERATOR #1: Ready with Brooklyn. Go ahead, please ...

ADAMS: Hello?

VOICE ON THE OTHER END: Mrs. Adams' residence ...

Whew! It all moves briskly along, but still takes a full two minutes
and six seconds of airtime between the time Orson puts his first
nickel in the phone and the time the phone is answered at his mother's
house.  Contrast that with how little time it takes us today to pick
up the phone, rip through a speed dial and have someone halfway around
the world answer in seconds. (And it probably costs less than $3.85!)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The above is mostly accurate. Usually
if the coin deposit required was more than the collection table inside
could hold, the operator refrained from asking for payment until the
called number or party answered. The reason was, if there was no answer
the money had to be returned, and what had been dumped in the box 
already could obviously not be returned through the coin return slot.
If it was a small enough amount the operator would ask for it and it
would be held inside on the table. The operator's switchboard had two
buttons on it marked 'return' and 'collect' and by pressing one button
or the other, the money would fall in the box or the table would tip
in the other direction and dump the coins back out to the caller. If
the amount or number of coins made it impossible to hold them all (and
this usually only happened on international calls costing ten or fifteen
dollars) then the operator would get the distant party on the line,
tell them to hold on a minute and come back to the caller asking for
the money. If the caller tried to be smart and talk to the other end
before the money all got deposited the operator would either tell them
to shut up and try to talk over them or she would 'split the connection';
that is, cut off the one party from hearing the other until all the money
was deposited. Then if she had to collect it in increments of a few
dollars at a time, tell them to wait while she collected and then ask
for more, she would. For calls costing less than a couple dollars they
asked for all the money up front because even with a busy/no answer at
the other end, this could still be funneled down the return slot by
tipping the table inside the phone to the left. 

It took as many operators as it did because there were apparently (in
the example on the radio) no direct lines between Gallup and New York.
Had there been a direct line between Albuquerque and New York then you
might have heard an operator answer 'Kansas City' or 'Chicago' (or maybe
both!) along the way, with a request from the earlier operator to please
extend the call. Had it been in the late 1920's or 1930's, it is likely
there would have been a half dozen more operators on the line in the
process of making the connection.  

In some places, the operator who collected the money could not return
it. Here in Chicago as late as about 1970, from some payphones in the
south end of the downtown area if you called a suburban point which
required the deposit of extra coins (over and above the five cents needed
for the local connection) you had to dial '211' and tell the operator
the number desired (to call Skokie for example). She would ask for the
additional twenty cents due then ring the number. If there was no answer
or the line was busy, she would tell you to hold on a minute for the
return of your money. She plugged in on the switchboard somewhere and
got another operator who answered 'Wabash' and your operator would then
say something like 'return on trunk 178'.  You would hear a rather rude
popping noise in the earpiece and the coins would come clattering down
into the coin return slot. Now and then an accident would occur: the
operator would collect the coins when she meant to return them or even
return them when she meant to collect them. In the former case, it was
handled rather casually. If the customer indicated he would be attempting
the call again in a few minutes, he would be told "when the operator
answers, tell her you have ten cents credit coming from your prior call."
If the coins were returned in error, the operator would ask you politely
to redeposit them.     PAT]

over the PSTN for incoming and outgoing fax delivery.  These fax ports
are R2 capable so that we can capture called number and calling number
for some of our value added features.

We now have a customer who wants us to use our value added features on

"black box" which could sit between us and the PSTN and make the PSTN
look like R2.

We know of one product: Pit Boss.  Is anyone out there aware of other vendors
for this type of product?  If so, please respond by E-mail.

        I am in need of the expertise of the readers of this group.

We need to provide 56kbps connections to numerous customers in town (we
are a non-profit society providing internet connections in the Canadian
North), and have had some success with expensive Synchronous CSU/DSU.

We would like to use an abundance of Asynchronous ports on our Netblazer
to provide 56kbps at a much lower cost. We will be using leased lines,
the 4-wire garden variety, 24ga., over up to 4 miles (5 would be better,
but it appears to be stretching it...).

Using good old RS-232, and preferrably Rack mounted at our central location,
and stand-alone at the remote end. Is there anything that will do the
job? Our target price per connection is around $US 730, or $CAN 1000.

The current candidate for the central site is a Black-Box rack with 
Mini Driver MP Cards (page 20 of the summer 95 catalog), ME778C-RJ11.

The only problem is that there does not appears to be any Stand-alone
equivalent for the other side. Does anyone know who actually MAKE these
units?

Any help greatly appreciated.

%T   "NetLaw:  Your Rights in the Online World"
 
Very similar to his earlier "Syslaw" (cf. BKSYSLAW.RVW), this is a
general guide to various legal aspects of life online.  The major
changes are the broadening of the scope from BBS level systems to
include online services and the Internet, and very handy (and
interesting) sidebars, which give a thumbnail sketch version of the
topic under discussion.  These usually include a reference to some
specific case.
 
Chapters address the issues of censorship, contracts, commerce, and
copyright.  Chapter four, which deals with the responsibility of the
system operator in light of online dangers, does touch on the topic of
malicious software.  I was disappointed that this is limited to a not
terribly accurate defining of terms, and almost no discussion of the
admittedly confused legal situation.  Further chapters cover privacy,
crime, search and seizure, and a rather disappointing chapter on
obscenity.  Appendices include some very useful sample contracts, and
various US laws.
 
Given recent developments which have strongly indicated the
international nature of the net and international legal ramifications,
it is discouraging to see that Rose still presents only a limited and
US-centric view.  However, the general principles he describes are
held in common law, and this book should at least provide guidance for
the broader online world.

Subject: Telecom Privacy at Americtech


Pat,

      I thought that your readers may find this artice disturbingly
interesting. Has
Ameritech gone off the deep end?!!?

       ==================================================

By David Adams, {Akron Beacon Journal}, Ohio Knight-Ridder/Tribune
Business News

May 24 -- Deborah Tarvin let her fingers do the walking right into her
neighbor's telephone bill. Due to changes in Ameritech's automated
toll-free customer service line last year, anyone can access basic
billing information about almost any of the company's 10.8 million
households in Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana -- just
by knowing that customer's phone number.

That means anyone -- your boss, your neighbors, your ex-spouse.
Ameritech previously required customers to use a three-digit access
code printed on their monthly bill. But early last year, as part of a
technological upgrade, the company dropped the code, citing Ameritech
studies showing customers overwhelmingly didn't want them.

But when Tarvin, a 42-year-old Akron resident, called last week to
find out about her May bill, she was surprised to learn how easily
anyone else could gain that information and much more.

Concerned, she tried her teenage daughter's phone number, and got her
daughter's billing information. Then, in successive calls, she
obtained the billing records for her parent and neighbors.

"I am outraged -- I feel those records should be private," Tarvin
said. "I think it's a breach of privacy."

Getting billing information by phone from Ameritech is markedly easier
than getting similar information from other businesses. Most banks,
credit card and other services require customers to use a combination
of account numbers and personal identification codes to access billing
data.

The information available through the customer service line, 800-660-
2626, includes a customer's balance due, last payment date, and when
the a payment was received by the company.

Customer service representative available on the service can also arrange
payment of a bill with a credit card.

Duplicate bills can also be obtained through the service but those
bills are only sent to the address of the customer listed on the bill.
The mailing addresses cannot be changed by telephone.

It isn't possible for anyone using the service line to find out what numbers
a customer has called.  

Still, Tarvin says simple billing information can reveal plenty, and
she called the 800 number to complain. "I kept telling her about right
of privacy, and she kept telling me about test studies," said Tarvin,
recalling her conversation with an Ameritech representative.

That's close to the company's official position on the subject. "We
did customer research, and they wanted this system to be quick and
convenient as possible," said Tim Fitzpatrick, Ameritech spokesman.
"They don't consider overall bill information vital, and they don't
want to keep track of another number ... the primary driver in this is
to make it as simple as possible."

Ameritech's move so far hasn't caused much of an uproar, according to
Ohio's Public Utility Commission, and Consumers' Counsel, the state
consumer advocate.

"We haven't had any calls about it, and we watch for things like
that," said Consumers' Counsel spokeswoman, Susan Gaskell. "There may
be some who would abuse this. But does that outweigh the convenience
of having this? It doesn't seem so."

Ameritech considered keeping the code system, Fitzpatrick said. But it
found out that most people who were calling to find out what they owed
had misplaced their bills. Without their bills, they couldn't find the
required three-digit code -- rendering the service line useless to
most people who needed it, Fitzpatrick said.

Since the change, use of the company's service line has doubled to
about five million calls a year, while Ameritech has received only
about a dozen complaints, Fitzpatrick said.

"Our customers are extremely satisfied with the system," he said. Just
the same, Ameritech is blocking access to the service for customers
who request it, and is considering returning to a system that requires
customers to use private access codes.

Subject: Sunday's OTR on WTIX
Date: Mon, 29 May 95 09:23:00 +6C


Yesterday, George Buck's Golden Era of Radio on WTIX aired an episode
of The Whistler (from 1951) in the morning edition of OTR, and a 1953
Suspense episode that evening -

each episode had an interesting telco/telecommunications aspect -

In 'A Law of Physics' on The Whistler, the murderer tried to claim in
his alibi was that he used his phone when the murder was committed --
his CAR PHONE -- but the sheriff made him 'test' his carphone at the
same point he claims he placed the call -- he tells the sheriff that he
pulled the car to the side of the road, lifted the reciever and
pressed the 'call-request' button 'like-this' and gave the operator
(verbally) the number he wanted to reach.  When the sheriff says
'well, where's your operator', the murderer says 'I don't understand
what's going on' (and you hear just crackle comming out), to which the
sheriff replies 'It's just a simple law of physics - You can't get any
radiotelephone transmission/reception along this stretch of highway -
It's in the valley' (boom-boom, followed by the whistling and the
announcer closing out the Signal Oil commercial and 'Stay tuned for
Our Miss Brooks, which follows immedietely on most of these same CBS
Stations.

Marvin Miller speaking --  This is C.B.S., the Co-LUM-bia Broadcasting 
System'

In 'Public Defender' on Suspense (with Frank Lovejoy) which was a
network aircheck tape, (1953), the program is interrupted (and this
was NOT part of the story) with 'We interrupt this program -- we have
more names of American Prisoners of War just released by the Korean
Communists' and the news announcer begins reading a list of 16 names
of American Servicemen and their hometowns.  While you couldn't hear
any clatter of the teletypewriter, the news announcer states that
'More of the names are coming across the wire now'.  This News
Bulletin lasted about three to four minutes, and while the original
pre-produced 'SUSPENSE' tape was continuing to roll from CBS
Hollywood, there was not much of a loss of storyline in the program
when 'rejoined'.  The announcer states further 'As more names are
released, we will interrupt our regularly scheduled programming on the
CBS Radio network.

This News Bulletin has come to you from CBS Radio News in New York, we
now return to the regularly scheduled programming on this CBS Radio
Network Station.'  There were NO musical-jingles/sound-effect-beeping
to alert listeners that an important bulletin was breaking in, and
obviously there was NO 'bleep' tones (CBS did NOT introduce 'NetALERT'
automation to alert affiliates not carrying a program at that time
that a bulletin was moving and to join the net-feed or to start their
'cart' machines or reel-tapes -- until around 1961/62).  ALSO, the
announcer did NOT identify himself, but I THINK that it was Dallas
Townsend who also anchored the weekday CBS World News Roundup

remember MONITOR, weekends on NBC Radio, whose jingle incidently was
donated to them by AT&T in 1955 -- the jingle for Monitor was a tape of
the AT&T inband MF KP tones, played at regular speed, fast-speed, and
slow-speed.  ANYONE OUT THERE REMEMBER THE MONITOR JINGLE (NBC called
it the Monitor Beeper)?

to declare war). As the war was ending, and the American prisoners of
war were being released, there was a period of about a week where those
bulletins were coming over the air two or three times every hour, and
each time, the names and home towns of the prisoners on the list were
read for the benefit of their families, etc., who were listening to the

Subject: UCLA Short Course on Wavelet Transform Applications to Data
Date: Tue, 30 May 1995 16:01:21
Organization: UCLA Extension


On September 11-15, 1995, UCLA Extension will present the short
course, "Wavelet Transform Applications to Data, Signal, Image, and
Video Processing", on the UCLA campus in Los Angeles.

The instructors are Dr. Harold Szu, Research Physicist, Washington, DC,
and Prof. John Villasenor, UCLA.

The National Information Infrastructure (NII) has generated
substantial interest in the broad tele-informatics processing area in
which a new mathematical tool called the Wavelet Transform (WT) has
been developed based on human sensor wideband transient
characteristics.  The wavelet transform has proved to be a powerful
and efficient mechanism whenever the noisy data, signal image, and/or
video processing functions are related to the quality of human sensory
perception.

This course builds the basics of both continuous and discrete WTs
(CWTs and DWTs) and demonstrates both techniques with various real
world signal restoration and pattern recognition applications.  Case
studies are then examined, including the FBI's decade-long fingerprint
compression program, the five-year NIST/ATP program in digital video
information infrastructure, the ARPA tele-medicine program, among
others.

The topics to be discussed include: Introduction to the Wavelet
Transform (WT); Applications-Driven Wavelet: Principles by
Dimensionality, Design by Functionality; Continuous and Discrete
Mathematics of WT and Comparisons, How to Design Mother Wavelets;
Neural Network Adaptive WT; Applications of Super-Mother Wavelets;
Advanced Medical Applications Using WT; Nonlinear Dynamics
Applications: Soliton WT Kernel; WT Implementation: Hardware and
Software Issues; Image Compression; 2D Wavelet Theory and Practice;
and Video Compression Applications.

The course fee is $1495, which includes extensive course materials.

Rogers Cantel in Canada seems to have a problem with the new area
codes.  I tried the test numbers that were posted here last week and
they were unable to connect me to *any* of the test numbers!

        I called their service line and reported that I couldn't call
a Southern Alabama number.  She did the standard things: Did I dial
the area code?  Was I sure the number was right (worked fine from my
home phbone I said)?  She checked to make sure there was no block on
long distance (shouldn't be, they just bill my MasterCard every month)
and there wasn't.  Since it was Sunday she said someone would look
into and give me a call back on Monday.  I left her the test number to
try.  We'll see what happens.

        Any other cellular users in Canada having a problem with these
new area codes?  Unitel (whom Cantel's parent company Rogers own 29%)
had no problem with them except the new Chicago code, but if Pat can't
even reach it from the Chicago area you really can't blame other
companies for not reaching it.  Interested to know what the status is.
I'm sure all hell will break loose next year with the 604 split in BC.
That will affect many more Canadians than the Alabama split.

I live in a community where this is an issue.  It has very little to
do with infrastructure costs.

What is really going on is that in many cities and towns across the US,
political power has been seized by a small but very organized clique of
individuals who mistrust technology and will do everything possible to
hamper it, including using junk science.

The cellular industry has been a popular victim.  We can not get a
small monopole installed because of bogus "health" concerns.  "The
cellular rays have been proven to cause brain cancer!"  "Our health is
more important than allowing yuppies to make calls from their cars!"

It wouldn't be so bad if the land lines were reliable, but they
aren't; winter storms take them down regularly.  Cellular is a crucial
communications backup link -- unless you're in a dead zone or a
fade-out zone.

I welcome any/all pulling of the fangs from these aging hippies.  It isn't
just federal over-regulation that needs to be ended.

What you experienced is not all that uncommon. The voicemail system is
supposed to retrieve the number you're dialing from thru a DID-like
delivery system as Pat stated. If the call to the voicemail number was
direct-dialed from a line that subscribes to voicemail, is it supposed
to play the greeting prompting you to enter your PIN. If the call was
"forwarded" to the voicemail number, the system should play your
greeting. However, if the voicemail number is dialed from a phone that
does *not* subscribe, the system plays the generic "Welcome to
voicemail ..." greeting. If there is corruption of the CLID to the
voicemail switch (we all know Caller ID is never corrupt) or the
system is overloaded, you will experience what you have described. I
have personally had this happen to me on my business lines. Not too
great for customers to get that message. I've also had the voicemail
system ring without answering, and even sometimes pick up then
disconnect. Also quite yukky.

Tried it here, Pat. In my CO (Bell Atlantic, 5ESS (release 9 I believe, 
non-generic), *67 does not disable CLID detection - voicemail properly
prompts me for my PIN. I don't think that the system really uses the
same delivery method as CLID (at least not CLID as we end users know it).
If you dialed *67 before dialing 0 or 00, the operator would still know
who you are (same is true for 911). But, the privacy flag may be ignored
for calls to the voicemail number, as you stated. Interesting test though,
Pat.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The Ameritech voicemail users manual claims
that the 'envelope' function on messages will give not only the time and
date of the call, but also the phone number of the calling party. So far 
it does not work that way here, and it seems a shame they can't add it
to the service. Just as the computer voice tells you the time and date
the call was received, it could easily tell you the number that called.
When I asked Ameritech about this they claim it is not part of the service,
yet their user manual says it is.  PAT]

Pat,

Here in the 516 part of NYNEXLand, the telco voicemail works exactly
as you described.  There's one additional catch.  If you three-way
call FROM YOUR OWN PHONE into the voicemail server, the server does
not receive the CID or ANI information from you, and asks you to enter
your mailbox number.

On a semi-related note, I have a Visa card from First USA Bank in
Philadelphia.  When dialing in for customer service, the voice response
system only asks me to touch-tone in the last four digits of my
account number for verification (it has already done an account lookup
based on the incoming ANI).  When I received a new card from them, they
sent what the industry calls a "dead plastic".  It's not "live" until
you call the number on the sticker on the card and verify that you
received it.  The sticker on the card emphasizes that you only activate
your new card "FROM YOUR OWN PHONE", as it does the same verification.

How is this related, you ask?  When I was on a call telling a friend
about this, I tried to three-way into First USA's 800 number (800-955-9900) 
and it acted as if it didn't receive the ANI information ("Please enter your 
16-digit account number").

I wonder why that is?

Subject: Prodigy Held Liable in Libel Case Casued by Subscriber


A New York state trial court ruled on May 24 that Prodigy is
responsible for the libelous statements of its users because it
exercises editorial control over their posts. In the case, an
anonymous Prodigy user made statements against New York Investment
firm Stratton Oakmont accusing it of criminal and fraudulent acts.
Stratton Oakmont sued Prodigy and the volunteer moderator of the forum
where the statements were published.

The Court found that Prodigy was acting as a publisher and therefore
was responsible for the content of the posts. The Court distinguished
the case from the earlier Cubby v. Compuserve decision, which found
that Compuserve was subject to the standards of a bookstore or
library. It that case, the US District court ruled that Compuserve had
no editorial control over the text.  According to the New York state
court:

  In contrast, here Prodigy has virtually created an
  editorial staff of Board Leaders who have the ability to
  continually monitor incoming transmissions and in fact do
  spend time censoring notes. Indeed, it could be said that
  Prodigy's current system of automatic scanning,
  guidelines, and Board Leaders may have a chilling effect
  on freedom of communications in Cyberspace, and it appears
  that this chilling effect is exactly what Prodigy wants,
  but for the legal liability that attaches to such
  censorship.
   
  Let it be clear that this court is in full agreement with
  Cubby and Auvil. Computer bulletin boards should generally
  be regarded in the same context as bookstores, libraries
  and network affiliates...It is Prodigy's own policies,
  technology and staffing decisions which have altered the
  scenario and mandated the finding that it is a publisher.

The court also attempted to downplay the significance of its decision
on the greater area of electronic networks:

  Prodigy's conscious choice, to gain the benefits of editorial
  control, has opened it up to greater liability that Compuserve
  and other computer networks that make no such choice. For the
  record, the fear that this Court's finding of publisher status
  for Prodigy will compel all computer networks to abdicate        
  control of their bulletin boards, incorrectly presumes that
  the market will refuse to compensate a network for its 
  increased control and the resulting increased exposure.

The Court also found that the volunteer "Board Leader" of the Prodigy
Bulletin Board was acting as an agent of the company. The Court found
Prodigy exercised control over the Board Leaders though the the
Bulletin Board Leader Agreement and the actions of Prodigy's
employees.

Prodigy has said that it will consider appealing the decision. EPIC
has materials on free speech available at http://epic.org/free_speech/
We will be making a copy of the decision available in the next few
days.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I think the decision was fair and proper.
So many folks involved in net publishing, operating BBS's, newsgroups
and whatever are insistent on having the same legitimacy granted to
them that the print media recieves. I agree with this, and think it
should be. I believe for example the TELECOM Digest is just as legitimate
a publication -- admittedly all electronic -- as say, {Telephony} or
Harry Newton's magazine. But the flip side of that coin is that with
that legitimacy comes responsibility. It used to be -- and maybe still
is, I don't use them enough to know -- that all the BBS sysops used
to whine and cry when they were called on the carpet about pirated
files on their system or porn or whatever the current crusade happened
to be. They'd say 'well I cannot be held responsible! I am just running
a little system as a volunteer! I have no control over what people post
on my computer ... well of course they had control; they can unplug the
computer from the phone line and turn off the electricity to it, but
that is *not what they meant*. What they meant was they wanted to play
along with the big boys but not be held accountable to the same standards.
Somehow, because they are little and operate as non-profit, all the rules
should be changed.  

I support Prodigy's right to have full editorial control over every last
item on their system if they want. Its their 'computer', their business,
their product. I support the right of people to sign up for and use such
a system if they want, or ignore it if they want in the same way people
either buy and read the {New York Times} or they read something else. I'm
sure Prodigy's customers are a happy lot, pleased with the service and
what they are getting for their money, etc. I know I certainly do not
intend to relinquish control of the editorial content of this Digest, and
I would not expect it of others. So if they do their thing, then they
are responsible for what they 'publish'.   

And I'll tell you who I think will be the next one to get their corporate
neck on the chopping block: America On Line. Those folks lean hard and
breath heavily on their user/subscribers also with their 'Terms of Service'
provisions which the Guides are *constantly* reminding people about.
Say a profane word in a chat room? Read those Terms of Service!  Put up
something disagreeable in one of the forums? Read those Terms of Service!
Like Prodigy, I think AOL is perfectly entitled to market a product they
think people want -- and they seem to be pretty much on the mark, and the
money if their growth in the past year means anything -- but if they are
going to structure it so much and make their users comply so closely with
their rules, etc, then watch what happens when someone breaks the rules
big time: well, let's sue AOL also, it was their carelessness in screening
the user ... the classic example of this is the story making the rounds
about how the pedophile lurked on AOL in Teen Chat and lured some kid to
meet him in person; mommie and daddy then sued AOL when they found out.  

Its still going to be a long time before the electronic media has full
parity with the print media, if we ever do. But whimpering about how
there is nothing we can do; no way to control the problems and troublesome
users on the net just won't work any longer. Do you want to clean things
up a little here or would you prefer to have Senator Exon and his cronies
do it instead?  He is chomping at the bit to do it himself, we all know
that ... so I think we need to let Prodigy hang on this ... just blow
in the wind so to speak, and learn their own lessons.      PAT]

%T   "UNIX Communications and the Internet"
 
Despite the increasing popularity of dial-up IP connections to the
Internet, the most common situation is still the dial-up shell
account.  The most common platform for providers is UNIX, and,
although there are many and varied menu- based shells available, at
some point the active Internet user is likely going to have to use
UNIX, and the UNIX communications tools.
 
The first edition of this book was written seven years ago, when UUCP
and the Usenet network (as opposed to the Usenet news application)
held a more significant position in global network communications.
Internet users may therefore find the non-Usenet material to be a
somewhat cursory add-on to the original text.  Email addressing
examples often give only the UUCP ("bang path") specifications,
without adding the more familiar domain name (user@subdomain.domain)
format.  (Given the size of the work, I was surprised that the
explanation lists only "logical" domains, such as .com and .edu,
without discussing geographic or more complex structures.)  The
coverage of Internet particulars is so terse that the explanation of
URLs (Universal Resource Locators) describes only HTTP (HyperText
Transer protocol, the underlying system for displaying W3 pages).  The
whole Internet "part" contains only three chapters (twenty-four is
really an extension of the UUCP content.)
 
Overall, however, the quality of the material is quite high.  There is
solid coverage of email, dealing both with concepts and the major mail
user agents.  The section on Usenet news is also good, though it shows
a similar lack of updating: neither trn nor tin are mentioned, and the
coverage of "network etiquette" is to be found in the chapter on
postnews.
 
UUCP is not dead by any means, and active Internauts, particularly
those working at multiple sites on the net, are likely to encounter it
at least occasionally.  The extreme domination of this book by UUCP
applications (readnews and postnews are, by now, specialty applications 
at best) at the expense of Internet-specific information, will limit
the usefulness of this edition.

I called GTE and wanted to know some rates for foreign exhange lines
the other day.  The lady told me "In Oregon, we do not have Foreign
Exchange, but we have a service called Group A service".  I asked her
what Group A was.  She went on to tell me that it would cost $700 to
install, cost approximatly $325 per month and I would be billed on
both incoming and outgoing calls at a rate of .07 per minute.  My plan
was to get a foreign exchange line to a city that is only ten miles
away from me, but is long distance.  I was so disgusted that I called
and complained to the PUC about GTE.  Why do you all think it's not an
available service in Oregon?

Any other ideas to have foreign exchange without paying these
ridiculous rates.  I have checked into leased lines, RF links,
everything but they are all expensive options.  Maybe I can get right
of way and string my own wire to someone who lives in the area I am
trying to call free!  :-)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Unless you think your usage per month
would be great enough that you would amortize that $700 install plus
$325 per month plus .07 per minute of useage in a short time, why not
consider an 800 number in the place you are trying to reach? Even if
the cost was 15 to 20 cents per minute, you would need a great deal of
usage before that $325 per month fee becomes less expensive. I don't
have a lot of sympathy these days for people who feel they need FX in
view of the large number of inexpensive 800 service providers around.
FX was a service devised fifty years ago for businesses who literally
had the volume of traffic required to keep that FX line loaded all the
time, which is about the only way they ever are cost effective. I think
one time here in the Digest someone analyzed this pretty closely and
detirmined there were times you could get by with 70 percent occupancy
on an FX line over a great distance; shorter FX's required still more
use.   PAT]

Subject: Telco Northwestel Errs With PBX; Help Please
Date: Mon, 29 May 1995 23:31:20 MDT


Northwestel, the telco for northern Canada, has nearly completed the
installation of a Northern Telecom Meridian 1 Option 11E PBX for the
hotel where I work.

There will be about 150 new telephones installed, all digital.  The
system was represented by the salesperson as being compatible with
analog devices.  The intent was to have a modern, and upgradeable,
system to serve the needs of business travellers.  Particularly, each
room was to have the capacity to support fax and modem use by guests.

Three days ago the technician installing the system informed the
manager of the hotel that the digital PBX was incompatible with analog
devices.  The proposed fix, to install analog cards into the system
unit, would be prohibitively expensive: 1.) the cards support a
limited number of lines, 2.) each card is expensive, and 3.) if the
digital lines were to be retained, a complete rewiring would be
required to provide access in each of 130 rooms.

I understand that there are risks to analog equipment if it is connected 
to the PBX due to the higher voltage, and the PBX itself can be harmed
if modems or fax machines are hooked up.  Is this true?

Are there any analog to digital converters available that can be
installed to permit this use on the PBX?  Where can they be purchased?

What should be done about the representation by the salesperson that the
system would be suitable "out-of-the-box" for this purpose?

Thank you for your attention.

ATLAS alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.

I hereby forward the statement made by the European Commission's
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert concerning the proposed
alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.

Extracted from the European Commission's RAPID Database, which is
publicly accessible via:

http://www.cec.lu/ml/rapid/rapmain.html

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ATLAS PROJECT: 

STATEMENT BY COMMISSIONER KAREL VAN
 MIERT

I have instructed the services of the Commission's Directorate-General
for Competition to inform Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom that
certain aspects of their cooperation through the ATLAS joint venture
company raise preliminary concerns under the EC Treaty's competition
rules.

I have indicated on numerous occasions,that the Commission is all in
favour of strategic alliances involving European telecommunications
operators (TOs) which allow them to enter the newly emerging market
for sophisticated Europe- and world-wide telecommunications services.
This new market mainly addresses the needs of large multinational
companies with operations over the globe and which require 24 hour
services regardless of differences in time zones, linguistic borders
and currencies. The Commission has already last year issued a
favourable Decision regarding the global telecommunications venture
between BT and the US operator MCI.

In examining the ATLAS venture, my services have gathered extensive
information from the parties themselves, from other telecommunications
service providers and from users. As a result, several problems have
been identified which will need to be examined further before the
Commission can take a definite position on the ATLAS venture:

- the ATLAS venture in its present form does not appear to be in a position
  to address the global needs of multinational companies;

- the ATLAS venture appears to relate mainly to the provision of domestic
  data communications services to companies operating in France or Germany
  and not at a global -- or even European-level; given the very high market
  shares of the parent companies on those domestic markets (+75% in both
  cases)and the fact that through the joint venture, the parent companies
  will not compete with each other on those markets, competition is likely
  to be eliminated or at least seriously restricted. The main victims will
  be small-and medium-sized companies, whose choice of service providers
  will be reduced and who are not in a position to exert any downward
  pressure on the prices for such services;

- the national markets in question are very important in terms of size in
  the total EU context: approximately 45 % of data communications services
  in the entire EU are accounted for by services provided in France and
  Germany;

- the elimination of competition on national markets is aggravated by the
  fact that the parent companies of ATLAS at present enjoy monopolies for
  the provision of infrastructure, the necessary building blocks for service
  providers competing with ATLAS; in the absence of alternative
  infrastructure allowing competing service providers to build up their own
  networks at competitive prices, competition will suffer a set-back
  precisely at the time that action taken by the Commission to liberalize
  all telecommunications services except basic voice services should begin
  to bear its fruits for the benefit of users.

My services have set out these major concerns as well as other
competition problems in an administrative letter addressed to the
parties, which I should stress by no means involves a definite
position on the part of the Commission. The next step in the procedure
will consist of examining any changes which the parties put forward to
meet the concerns expressed by the Commission's services.

Subject: 'Sorry, Wrong Number' (was 'Long Distance in 1942')
Date: Tue, 30 May 95 11:07:00 GMT


Suspense was produced in Hollywood from about four weeks into its run
in 1942, thru August or September 1959.  It was produced in New York
from then until its end at the end of September, 1962.

Los Angeles (and most ALL of Southern California was primarliy a 'step
by step' type of switching area thru the early 60's.  New York was
'Panel' and 'Crossbar' as was Phily, Chicago, Frisco, DC, etc.

FOR THE MOST PART - Panel/Crossbar areas used N11 codes for special 
services, Step areas used 11X codes.

Sorry Wrong Number - this episode took place in New York, although Agnes
did it live and later on tape from CBS/KNX at Sunset & Gower in Hollywood.  
She did no more than seven performances on the Suspense series -- the
1957 performance (by that time Suspense was pre-taped sometime earlier
than the network feed/broadcast) which was rerun in 1960 (with new
commercials and slight reformatting for open/close) is the one I have a
good copy of -- I have the 1960 rerun on tape.  I also have some 'bad'
copies of earlier editions of this episode.

Agnes at one point calls information, and she dials (if you listen to
the pulls of the dial) 113.  THIS was the code for Information at that
time in Southern California, while NYC really used 411.

In many an episode of Perry Mason (TV, Raymond Burr -- I've never
heard the 'soap-opera' daytime radio version from the 1940's thru mid
50's), people dial Information with 113, and Long Distance with 0 or
110.  In Panel/Crossbar areas, LD was 211.  Perry Mason took place in
L.A., and was of course filmed there also.

While Panel/Crossbar offices COULD handle 11X service codes, most areas that 
had Panel/Crossbar switches since the 1920's used N11 service codes.

There have been many posts to the three groups lately about the N11 codes.

The OLD 'standard' assignments were:

211 - Long Distance
411 - Information
611 - Repair
811 - Telco Business Office
911 - Emergency (assigned in the 1960's)

OTHER codes have been used for ringback, testboard, reading back your 
number, etc.

The OLD (and here, I MEAN OLD) 'standard' assignments for 11X codes were:

111111111... (each subsequent '1' keeps getting 'absorbed')
112+  Long Distance Access (later replaced by 1+)
113 - Information
114 - Repair
115 - Mobile/Conference/Marine/etc. 'Leave-Word' Operator
116 - 'COUNTY' operator for reaching nearby rural points
117 - Testboard
118 + N1 - ringbacks on four and eight party (i.e.calling someone who
shares your party line. You could NOT just dial them from a step office
 -- you had to dial a special code and hang up -- and then you and the
party-on-your line who you were calling -- would alternately ring with
your coded rings).
119 + 1 - ringback for two party lines -- after hanging up, each party
would alternately ring.  
110 - Long Distance.

These codes were not ALWAYS the same in every place -- and not ALL
codes were used for any place.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Back in the days of '211' for the long
distance operator in Chicago -- prior to about 1975 -- we also had '811'
which served two purposes over a period of about forty years. During the
Second World War, '811' was called 'Priority Long Distance' and it was
used by military personnel who had the authority to ask that some other
connection be dropped if necessary to allow for completion of an urgent
military call. 

At the same time, and for the thirty years following the war, '811' was
used by hotel switchboard operators, along with hospital and university
switchboard operators for 'automatic time and charges callback'. If the
call came in on 811 rather than 211, the Bell long distance operator knew
it was a switchboard calling where some chargeback arrangement was in
effect, meaning time and charges had to be quoted to the hotel operator
immediatly when the call was finished. The guest might be checking out
momentarily and the front desk needed the charges so they could be put
on the guest's bill.

AT&T paid a commission to the hotels/hospitals/universities, etc with
switchboards for their traffic in return for the hotel/hospital/university
guarenteeing paying of the bill caused by the guest's telephone calls. 
After all, strictly speaking, a transient person could call telco and
demand an installation. This would be a nuisance to telco so the deal
was the institution would run all the traffic through the switchboard
and pay the bill, which had usually a 10-12 percent discount on it. The
hotels, hospitals, etc naturally collected the full thing from the
tenant/guest/patient.  Part of the deal was though that the telco 
operators had to quote T&C 'as promptly as possible' following the
completion of the call so the switchboard could complete their ticket
which was then passed to the front desk or bookkeeper or whatever for
adding to the guest's account.  If telco failed to quote T&C on any
given call, they wrote it off. The institution was only responsible
provided the operator quoted the charge to be collected. 

To resolve the problem of 'you never quoted on that call' versus 'yes
we did', the switchboard toll tickets were serialized, as were the
toll tickets used by telco operators. The switchboard operator had to
introduce each call to the long distance operator by saying 'hotel
time and charges, room XXX' unless the call went out from the switchboard
via 811, in which case the hotel operator merely had to introduce each
call saying 'room XXX'. When the call came down a few minutes later the
Bell operator frequently held the line up and would ring back to the
switchboard saying 'T&C Room XXX, one dollar seventy cents plus tax,
I am <serial number> who are you?' And the switchboard operator would
respond 'I am <serial number>'. Disputes over whether or not T&C were
quoted could be resolved at billing time when telco was able to produce
the hotel's toll ticket serial number as proof it had been called back.
In the case of bigger switchboards, often times all the toll tickets
for a given period of time, usually one hour, were given to the telco
supervisor to all be quoted at one time. Then the conversation would
go on for several minutes, with the long distance operator telling the
hotel operator, 'ready to quote are you ready?'  When the hotel operator
had all the tickets for the past hour or so in front of her then the
LD operator would rattle off the time and charges on each, stopping 
after each quote for "I am 'operator <serial number>' you are?" and the 
hotel operator's response.  In the very, very big phone rooms such as
the Conrad Hilton Hotel, the University of Chicago, Rush-Presbyterian
Hospital and places like that, instead of callbacks with T&C telco sent
the charge amounts via telex. U of C for example had a telex machine
just for use by the long distance operators. Once an hour or so that
telex would come to life noisily and on the other end a clerk at telco
was banging out the time and charges for all long distance calls sent
through the university switchboard over the past hour. 

Of course the big phone rooms such as the above did not dial anything
to get long distance. They did not have to use 811 or 211 ... the
university operators, like the operators at the Conrad Hilton Hotel
simply plugged into 'tie lines' located right on their switchboard.
Little jacks that looked like any other extension on the switchboard,
they were actually direct to long distance. When the long distance
operators got the corresponding signal on their switchboard, it was
known who was calling and the university or hotel operator merely
had to pass the extension number or room number of the user since that
was not readily apparent to the Bell operator.  

The hotels and others getting commissions from Bell for handling and
paying for the long distance traffic were not supposed to use those
lines (or '811') for their own administrative traffic. Those lines and
the commissions paid by Bell as a result were only supposed to be used
by the 'guests', (or patients, or students). Administrative traffic from
the institution itself was supposed to go out over 211 the same as
any 'regular' subscriber and was not commissionable.    PAT]

Subject: Can I Bring Legal Action to Force NYNEX to Do Its Job
Date: 31 May 1995 04:36:20 -0400
Organization: URL:http://www.armory.com/~ulmo/ (see rivers.html for PGP key)


Is someone willing to give me free legal advice who can point me at
information that will work as intended in court?  Here's the question:

Is it possible for me to bring legal action to force NYNEX to follow
laws and/or agreements it is bound to, when my relationship with it in
each particular case is via some other entity, in one case via MFS,
and in another via a company which uses MFS, both of which are
depending on NYNEX to do something or other with their lines?

In each case I am willing to do the legal procedure whereas the people
I'm dealing with may or may not have the balls to do it, may or may
not have the same approach to dealing with this issue, and may or may
not have the same amount of stake in the issues as me, nevermind may
or may not have already received appropriate bribes from the appropriate 
companies (hint hint??  Would I be considered an accessory if I were to ask 
for this?)

I would have a hard time quantifying money lost.

I would need to identify laws and agreements being broken; some of
these may be hard to find or private; are there things that help me
obtain these items?  The most basic general ideas I have come up with
are: causing unfairness in market; causing second, third, fourth, etc.
parties to violate their own promises based on missed and/or inappropriate 
deadlines, reasonable levels of service, etc.

I know that in the true spirit of open market, the biggest incentive
for NYNEX to do their job would be for me to switch companies.
However, there is no other company which is free totally from the
reins of NYNEX within Manhattan except Me, Myself and I; therefore in
the interest of settling these issues should I start my own telephone
company just to serve myself, including all the governmental
communications necessary to secure access and ability to modify the
necessary properties which are between the two points which I wish to
connect, and the associated money involved?  Or should I see that to
serve myself I must start or cause to have started a company which
works for many who share similar interests and can obtain my goals?

Or am I being really blind and dumb and not realizing other options to
connect me at the data rate of at least 14,400 bits per second to
another location within Manhattan 24 hours a day as a personal adjunct
to my life that I can afford?  For example, I have called the two
cable companies but have not bothered researching a microwave link
because I have made the rash assumption (without checking) that my
four story building is not line-of-sight and microwavable to the other
building (whose location I do not know) and/or the use of another
radio device (not so direction dependent and humanly dangerous as
microwave) is prohibitively expensive considering the applications
necessary to the FCC and various other entities for bandwidth which I
may use for any purpose I want to at any time via any particular
transceiving method(s) which would also yield at least 14,400 bps
around the clock with fairly low latency (less than 2s).

Thank you for any and all help.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Bear in mind that free legal advice is
always worth everything you paid for it. Furthermore, I am not your
attorney and you should seek the advice of counsel specializing in
communications law before taking any action. With that said, I believe
I am correct in noting that since you have no direct dealings with 
NYNEX, you cannot sue them for anything. They made no promises or
commitments to *you*; they have violated no contracts or conditions
with *you*, and your losses, if any, are due to promises that were
made to you by MFS. Now perhaps 'everyone knows' that MFS has been
unable to meet its commitments to you because of something NYNEX did
or did not do, but that's the problem of MFS and not yourself. 

MFS said to you in effect 'we can do a better job' and you took them
at their word and entered a contract with them. I imagine you will
see their contract -- what they actually agreed to in writing with
you -- gives them a way to weasel out of this also, but whether it
does or does not, your complaint is with promises and commitments
MFS made; promises they made when they knew or should have known that
*their vendor NYNEX* was unlikely to cooperate. You did not enter into
any contracts with NYNEX, therefore they owe you nothing. 

You can call yourself a 'telephone company' if you want to; that does
not mean you are one by any generally understood use of the term, and
I suggest you talk at length with the state utility commission before
foolishly designating yourself with this title. And speaking of the 
utility commission, I think laws in many states and the telco's own
tariffs require you to exhaust any and all administrative remedies
prior to bringing suit -- in your case against MFS since that is the
company which you allege made promises and commitments to you. 

But more to the meat of the matter: you say you are unable to get 14.4
on a 24 hour per day basis 'at a rate you can afford'. If that is the
case, I don't think you are going to be able to pursue this legally
at a rate you can afford either. Are you really serious that dialup as
needed won't work just as well?  Have you looked at technical explanations
to your problem as well or just thought in terms of legal action?  What
do you suppose a judge is going to do if one did agree to hear this
case? He'll listen to the technical experts from NYNEX and go along with
whatever they tell him.  PAT]

Subject: Telecom (NON)-Privacy at Ameritech


Greetings. In a recent Digest, it was reported that Ameritech now
allows anyone to obtain bill payment information for any Ameritech
line (unless blocked by specific subscriber request) -- a true bonanza
for snoops in general and for folks trolling for big bill customers to
target for marketing.

Obviously, this is a terrible policy.  It is unfortunately not a
unique situation.  Ameritech's explanation (as reported in TELECOM
Digest) has been spouted by numerous other utilities, banks, and other
entities.  If a subscriber complains, they are frequently told that
"hardly anyone else has complained about the system".  If 1000 people
complain, they may each individually be told that they're essentially
the "lone wolf".

It is also common for these entities to say that they're just trying
to make things easier for their customers.  This is the logic used for
simple passcodes (e.g. zipcode, which anyone can determine), ill-advised 
passcodes (e.g. use of the SS number), or as in the case of Ameritech, no
passcode at all.

It is unfortunately nearly always the case that "most" people won't
complain about such a system until something happens that impacts them
negatively as a result of the poor security on the system.  The
entities with these poor security policies are simply trading off the
hassles and disruptions caused to subscribers about whom information
from the system is misused, against having to deal with callers who
can't remember their passcode.

The "solution" is obvious.  Ameritech should return to a "random"
passcode system, and allow customers who have a problem remembering
the code to either choose something simple ("0000") or opt for no code
at all.  But such a choice of no security should be made by the
individual customer -- to make it the default condition for all
customers is very bad policy.

Experience has shown that the only effective way to deal with these
types of situations is to complain loudly to the highest level you can
reach.  In the case of Ameritech, complaints (and suggestions for
"fixing" the problem, as mentioned above) should be made to the
billing supervisor level at least -- better yet, speak to the
managers.  And while it means taking the time to put it down in
written form, letters to state PUCs are *extremely* important with
such matters.

I'm sure there are just a *few* Ameritech subscribers reading this
now.  If each of you expressed your opinion (one way or another) to
the PUC and Ameritech regarding their system, I suspect you could have
considerable impact.

Subject: Help Wanted With BigMouth


        Dear Mr. Townson:

        In a recent article appeared in your TELECOM e-zine (May 9)
you described, in quite a detailed way, the implementation of an auto-
attendant system for a Greyhound bus station, in which you employed
Talking Technology's BigMouth card. I have used the same card for a
very similar application in my parents' shop, in Italy. I've put that
card behind their Panasonic KX-T61610 PABX to answer all incoming
calls (on 4 C.O. lines) and direct customers to the specific
department and/or sales assistant of their choice, by means of
announcements over the shop P.A. system. Needless to say it works
flawlessy, and it pleases callers too.

        I noticed, however, that in your article you mentioned the use
of a (probably) temporised job for after hours service. For a number
of reasons, my parents would like the system to switch automatically
to "night" mode at evenings and on weekends, and then back to the
regular telebox scheme during regular business hours. I have been
struggling with this problem for quite a while now, but have not made
any progress yet. I must admit that my knowledge of personal computers
and DOS is quite limited (after all, I'm an astronomer .... and we
generally deal with quite different problems here ...). I was then
wondering if you could possibly give me some hints or point me to some
appropriate readings that could help me make this one more step ahead.

The FCC is expected to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)
today, freezing the charges applied to the derived channels of an IDSN
facility as discussed here in prior notes. The LEC's have proposed
various charges ranging from one SLC for the BRI & add'l chgs, to
someone's proposal of 24 SLC's for a T-1 facility. The goal of the
user community is of course to minimize the number of SLC's applied,
keeping the ISDN rates as low as possible. I'll look for the public
notice and post it for what it is worth - i.e. PN's tend to be very
vague, and the order itself has up to 30 days to hit the street.

(And a later message which arrived ... PAT)

In answer to my own expectation of today's FCC order - here it is on ISDN
- see also other note posted containing the lengthy NPRM.

NEWSReport No. DC 95-76    ACTION IN DOCKET CASE               May 30,
1995

                          COMMISSION CONSIDERS
                 CHANGES TO SUBSCRIBER LINE CHARGE RULES
               FOR ISDN AND OTHER DERIVED CHANNEL SERVICES 
                            (CC DOCKET 95-72)

     The Commission is considering changes to its Subscriber Line
Charge rules as they apply to Integrated Services Digital Network
(ISDN) and other derived channel services.  Derived channel services
provide customers with multiple voice-grade-equivalent channnels over
a single facility.  The Commission described several basic principles
that should guide this process.  The Commission stated that it must be
careful to avoid creating regulatory barriers to the development of
beneficial new technologies, particularly when those services and
technologies can facilitate access to the benefits of the National
Information Infrastructure.  At the same time, the Commission added
that it should not favor one technology or service over others.

     The Commission today released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
seeking comment on the application of Subscriber Line Charges (SLCs)
to ISDN and other derived channel services.  This proceeding will
consider changes in the existing rules, which provide for application
of a SLC to each derived channel in the case of such services.


     In a Public Notice, also released today, the Common Carrier
Bureau announced suspension of its enforcement authority against local
exchange carriers (LECs) that do not apply a SLC to each derived
channel for services such as ISDN pending further action in the
rulemaking proceeding.  This suspension of enforcement was subject to
LEC compliance with certain conditions to ensure that interstate toll
rates would not increase.

     In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission proposed
several alternatives for applying SLCs to derived channel technologies
in addition to the current rule.  These options include, among others:

     o Apply one SLC per facility.  For example, a subscriber to
either Basic Rate Interface or Primary Rate Interface ISDN service would 
pay one SLC for each ISDN facility.

     o    Charge SLCs based on a ratio of the average LEC cost of
providing a derived channel service to the average LEC cost of providing 
an ordinary local loop or T-1 facility.

     o    Permit local exchange carriers some flexibility in setting SLC
rates for derived channel services, but modify the price cap rules so that 
any reduction in SLC flat rate recovery does not increase the Carrier Common 
Line (CCL) rates and potentially increase interstate toll rates.
 
     The Commission also expressed concern about measures that could
reduce SLC revenues, and potentially increase interstate toll rates.
The Commission stated that the implementation of SLCs to recover a
portion of the cost of local loops (that connect a subscriber's home
or business with the local telephone company central office) has
produced significant benefits, including reduced interstate toll
rates.  (A reduction in SLC revenues would permit LECs to increase CCL
charges, which affect the level of interstate toll rates.)

     The Commission stated that policies that appear to reduce
dramatically SLC charges to large business customers, but not to
residential customers, would need to be carefully examined.  The
Commission also noted that resolution of these issues should take into
account competitive developments in the interstate access market.

     ISDN permits digital transmission over ordinary local loops and
T-1 facilities through the use of advanced central office equipment
and customer premises equipment.  Currently, carriers offer two basic
types of ISDN service.  Basic Rate Interface service allows a
subscriber to obtain two voice-grade-equivalent channels and a
data/signalling channel over an ordinary local loop.  Primary Rate
Interface service allows subscribers to obtain 23 voice-grade-equivalent 
channels and one data/signalling channel over a T-1 facility.

     The costs of the local loop portion of the telephone network are
recovered through charges levied at both state and federal levels,
with approximately 25 percent of those costs collected through
interstate charges.  Since 1984, those charges have been collected
through SLCs, a flat fee on every subscriber's monthly telephone bill,
as well as a usage-sensitive charge called the Carrier Common Line
charge.  For residential and single line customers, the SLC is capped
at $3.50 per line.  For multiline business users, the charge is capped
at $6 per line.  That portion of the interstate costs not collected
through the SLC is collected through the CCL charge, a per minute
charge reflected in interstate long distance rates.

     Action by the Commission May 24, 1995, by Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (FCC 95-212).  Chairman Hundt, Commissioners Quello,
Barrett, Ness and Chong.

        I am in need of the expertise of the readers of this group.

We need to provide 56kbps connections to numerous customers in town (we
are a non-profit society providing internet connections in the Canadian
North), and have had some success with expensive Synchronous CSU/DSU.

We would like to use an abundance of Asynchronous ports on our Netblazer
to provide 56kbps at a much lower cost. We will be using leased lines,
the 4-wire garden variety, 24ga., over up to 4 miles (5 would be better,
but it appears to be stretching it...).

Using good old RS-232, and preferrably Rack mounted at our central location,
and stand-alone at the remote end. Is there anything that will do the
job? Our target price per connection is around $US 730, or $CAN 1000.

The current candidate for the central site is a Black-Box rack with 
Mini Driver MP Cards (page 20 of the summer 95 catalog), ME778C-RJ11.

The only problem is that there does not appears to be any Stand-alone
equivalent for the other side. Does anyone know who actually MAKE these
units?

Any help greatly appreciated.

Subject: Is LDDS Pulling My Leg?
Date: 30 May 1995 15:55:44 -0400
Organization: PANIX Public Access Internet and Unix, NYC


I had thought the days of this kind of blame-shifting were over, but
it seems not. Recently, I moved to the Houston area, and ordered three
dial lines for my house. The local telco did a fairly adequate job of
installing the new cable and lines on time, and only needed to come
back once to get it working.

The problem started as soon as I tried to use a high-speed (14.4 or
28.8) modem on the lines. Connections either renegotiate or drop off
constantly.  2400 seemed to be the only thing that worked. Southwest
bell was called in, and their answer was to send a guy to hook a butt
set to the demarc, and check for dial tone. (The analogy of a
speed-bump on the Infobahn didn't cross my mind. Well, maybe only
once.)

Same problem continued, until I finally noticed that this was only
happening on long-distance connections. Aha! I use LDDS as my carrier,
since they have good rates, so I tried having the modem stick a 10288
in front of a number, to see if the old death-star folks could do any
better.  Call gets completed, and the signal levels have my modems
practically singing Beethoven's ninth in praise of a clear signal.

Call went in to LDDS. (24 hrs later, no response, so opened up a second
trouble ticket).

The next evening, I call LDDS to check up on the ticket, and their CSR
proudly announces that it has been tracked down to an AT&T problem. (I
remind her that using AT&T is the only way I can actually COMPLETE a
call, and if that's a symptom of the problem, for God's sake, please
don't fix it!)

Two days later, and I'm ready to use tin cans and string. Call up
LDDS, and track down the tech who worked on the ticket. Bottom line:
LDDS will not guarantee any data connection at all, and simply
suggests that I switch to AT&T, or go back to using a 1200bps modem.
Vague mumblings were offered about AT&T either having better connections 
or less aggressive compression algorithms, and that if I screamed
enough, I might get someone to listen, but no specific suggestions or
where to turn could be given.

Well, I just got off the phone with AT&T, who seemed quite happy to
have my business. I guess the old "you get what you pay for" holds
true in this case. I wonder if anybody out at LDDS heard it. :-)

So, my question is, if I were serious about getting LDDS to provide decent 
service, who would I have to chase after -- them, or Southwest bell?

An article in the Toronto {Globe and Mail} travel section (page E1,
May 27, 1995) warns that hotels and restaurants in France are now free
to charge whatever they want for calls made from pay phones and room
phones on their premises. The rates are supposed to be posted, but may
be confusing to people from outside France if they are quoted per
pulse rather than per minute.

People travelling in the U.S. have learned to watch out for COCOTs,

France has been added to the list of countries with rip-off pay

You are probably aware (but didn't mention!) that there are two
different kinds of switches.  The first silently answers the call and
listens for the "CNG" tones from a "calling" fax, or touchtone codes,
or "reverse" modem tones, and routes the call accordingly generating
it's own ringing signals on the appropriate output jack.

The other type uses "distinctive ringing" or "ringmate" or whatever
your local telco calls that service, and routes the call by listening
to the ringing pattern, without actually answering the call first.
This telco feature provides more than one number for your line with
different ring patterns, at a lower cost than a separate line,
although of course you only have one real line and except for features
like three-way-calling and call-waiting, you can only have one call in
progress at a time.

I use a ComSwitch 660, one of the first type.  The box has an input
jack and outputs for FAX, PHONE, ANS-MACHINE, and AUX.  Phone and
Ans-mach are really just connected together, AUX is for your modem (or
other).  The box answers the call, listens for the CNG (calling) tone
from a fax, and if found rings the fax, if not rings the
Phone/ans-mach jacks.  You can also assign a touch tone code of up to
4 digits to both the FAX and AUX lines and route calls that way - the
box has applications beyond just FAX switching.  I only have one
regular caller who has a fax so old it doesn't send CNG tones.  FAX
machines in manual mode also don't send CNG (ie., if you pick up the
handset to place the call).  That person uses the touchtone code to
route it to the fax.

Reverse modem tone is a modem that places a call with itself in ANSWER
mode so it sends a tone.  The answering modem must then be in
originate mode to communicate.  All this doesn't work well with the
new modems that have type recognition and multiple handshakes, I find
using the touchtone codes to work fine.

Cost of this box was around $90.  This type of box can be used on any
line without additional telco costs.  The second type is possibly more
reliable and lets you advertise separate fax and voice numbers, but
with a monthly telco cost.

Subject: $0 to $3 per Month Cellular Service!


After reading an earlier article in this Digest entitled "Using a
Unregistered Cellular Phone", I decided to try it myself with a
recently acquired "brick" phone.  I posted a Usenet request and
received helpful private email replies from Darrel, Simon, and David.
Their information is incorporated here, and I thank them for it.

Here is what I have learned about low-cost emergency cellular
service in northern California:

PLAN A

In northern California, setting the MIN (phone number) and the
carrier code to all zeros, as described in the article, worked
very briefly only.  By working, I mean that an attempt to call
any number would reach a recording telling me to dial *311 for an
operator to place a credit card call.  I dialed *311 and verified
Cellular One's rates: $1.25 for setup and $1.95 per minute, as I
recall.  Of course you do have to give your credit card number
over the air, which is a bit of a worry.

Alas, a few hours later, any use of the Send button yielded only
a reorder (fast busy) signal.  Even 911 was blocked!

Since I did not write the carrier's MTSO switch software, I do
not know exactly what caused the system to block my phone.  But I
suspect that it was either the fact that my phone number was all
zeros or that I attempted a non-free call by entering a local
number and pressing Send.

I next set the MIN to a non-zero value, using a known non-cellular
phone number, since I didn't want to appear to the switch software to
be impersonating a valid user.  I left the carrier code as all zeros.
This time, I did not attempt a non-free call.  Instead, I restricted
my testing to *nnn calls.  An attempted call to the traffic reporting
line of a local all-news radio station gave me the same recording I
described above.  Sure enough, *311 now gets me the credit card
operator.  I have not tried 911, but I'll bet it does work at the
moment, and I'd rather not annoy the CHP.

Through two weeks of occasional testing, the phone has continued to
give me the recording asking me to dial *311, rather than the fast
busy that I got when service was blocked.  Thus, although I have not
actually placed any calls, I believe that the phone will allow me to
make a call when I need to.

On the basis of this testing, I believe that in northern California,
to have durable *311 access for credit card calling without a cellular
subscription, one or both of the following actions is required:

  1) setting the MIN to a non-zero value;
  2) refraining from attempting any non-free calls.

Minimizing the time your phone is powered on wouldn't hurt, either, so
the phone will not be sending its MIN and ESN (equipment serial
number) to the network every five minutes.  My testing did not reveal a
problem here, possibly meaning that the switch software does not check
the MIN/ESN pair until a call is actually attempted.  But you might as
well keep the phone off and save the battery.  There is really no need
to turn the phone on until you want to make a call, since you can't
receive calls anyway.

I have not experimented with carrier codes other than zero, so I
recommend setting the code to zero unless the above does not work.  I
can't imagine that anything good would happen if the switch software
finds out that your supposed carrier either doesn't exist or doesn't
know who you are.

If the above technique works for you, you have emergency cellular
service, outgoing calls only, at roughly $2 per minute, $0 per month
 -- not a bad deal!  Otherwise, it's time for ...

PLAN B

If the above does not work, you have several other options.  First, if
you can call at first but get blocked shortly thereafter, you could
become a *paying* hacker, figuring out how to change your ESN and
doing so once per credit card call, so that the switch software does
not have the ESN in its "kill file".  Not very practical and not
recommended.

Second, you could sign up for a cheap "zero minutes free" service.
For $35 per year, roughly $3 per month, you can subscribe to HELPTEL,
which provides outgoing-only call capability at $3.50 per minute
(ouch!) anywhere in the US.  If you were in northern California, you
could dial *311 for cheaper outgoing calls instead.  Your local
carriers may have an equivalent service.  The main thing HELPTEL does
for you is to make your phone officially subscribed, so that the MTSO
switch software will not block your MIN/ESN pair.

Call Lindsay Communications in Leominster, Mass. 800-370-4445 for the
brochure on HELPTEL.  I did.  They are a direct reseller of air time.
They normally charge $45 for programming, but they will give you the
necessary information to program your own phone, which isn't any more
difficult than programming a VCR.  My thanks to Darrel for this find.

Third, for slightly greater use, and rates lower than $3.50 per minute, 
you can sign up for an emergency plan with a Canadian cellular carrier.  
The rate is $15 Canadian per month, which is probably better than your
local carrier offers.  The bonus with this option is that you should
be able to make calls *to* the cellular phone in unusual circumstances.  
For example, a one-minute call would suffice to notify you to call
home from the nearest pay phone.  In fact, if you knew no one else
would be calling, you could simply turn the phone off when it rings
(rather than answering the call and incurring a one-minute charge),
drive to the nearest pay phone, and call home.  That would let your
cellular phone work as a crude wide-area pager.

The fourth option costs a bit more and requires a trusted friend.  I
don't claim to fully understand this suggestion, but I am told that
you and your friend can split the cost of a cellular phone and
extension with the same number.  This would work much better if you
don't plan to take incoming calls on the cellular phone.  Cellular One
tells me that they do not offer this service here in northern
California.  Such an offering would probably require that the switch
software be able to associate two different ESNs with the same MIN.
Or you could alter the ESNs to match each other and hope that both
phones are never turned on at the same time (which the switch software
would interpret as fraudulent use).  Based on my limited understanding, 
I can't recommend this option unless your carrier offers it officially.


CONCLUSION

In summary, it's time to buy a used cellular phone for your wife's
birthday!  Costs about the same as a couple dozen roses.  One way or
another, you *can* make it work for outgoing calls!

Subject: ALI From Centrex With Many Locations
From: steegman@tomcindy.rotterdam.ny.us (Tom Steegmann)
Date: Tue, 30 May 1995 13:26:34 -0400 (EDT)


I work for Schenectady County, NY E911, and we are having a problem
with some of the larger centrex operations (including the one for our
county office building).  The problem is that the ALI information
coming from any of the trunks is undependable.  The county government
is based at 620 State St, but has offices in at least seven other
buildings all on 388-xxxx.  According to NYNEX, it is actually a
centrex sitting on top of a PBX, if that helps.  Anyway, the centrex
has only 14 lines going out, and the 15th line picked up rolls over to
a non dedicated 386-2xxx line, of which there are 30 extras.  The
386-2xxx lines are based in 1 Broadway Center, where my office is.
Now, if anyone calls 911 from ANY 388-xxxx line, it will either show
up as 620 State St, or if it the 15th or greater line picked up, 1
Broadway Center.  I am wondering if there is any way to program the
centrex into recognizing a 911 call and forcing it through with the
correct ALI information.  I thought maybe installing a dedicated
outside line (not on the centrex) at each location that to use for
911 calls might be a solution.  I don't know, I'm new at phones.  At
any rate, NYNEX has been reluctant to engage in discussion with us so
I can assume they don't really want to deal with it.  We can't possibly
be the first people to recognize the risks involved here.  If anyone
has any idea what I'm talking about, please reply to my email address.
Thanks for any ideas, we are getting close to going on line, and have
only non-solutions so far (NYNEX suggested that we blank out all ALI
information for all the numbers on that centrex.  That's not a solution.)


Tom Steegmann    Schenectady County E911
steegman@tomcindy.rotterdam.ny.us


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Centrexes do *not* all have to return the
same address. I just now tried the Name and Address service offered by
Ameritech (312-796-9600) and punched in a couple different numbers on the
centrex for the City of Chicago Police Department. The response -- although
somewhat convoluted -- came back 'City of Chicago 25th District Grand-
Central, 5555 West Grand Avenue'. I was advised there are 'many' listings
for that number and did I want another one? A second listing for the same
number was 'Police Chicago Dept 25th Dist. 5555 W. Grand Avenue'. And that
was the 25th District station of the Chicago Police Department at the
address given. The City of Chicago uses 312-744, 312-746, and 312-747 for
its centrex, and this covers all agencies and departments. When  I tried
744-4000 which is the main switchboard number the listing was 'Chicago City, 
121 N. Lasalle' which is City Hall. 

Now I realize the database which is used for Caller-ID and public services
such as Ameritech's are not going to be entirely the same as those used by
911, however the different numbers on a centrex can be picked out and
identified one from another *provided it was set up that way*. If all the
centrex lines were listed with the same address when the centrex was
installed then so be it; that's what the database will show.  

In the case of a PBX where all the trunks are at one place, and users
at an OPX (off-premise extension) dial 9 to get an outside line, then
everyone is going to show up at the address where the switchboard is
physically located, since usually when the telco central office responds
to the PBX trunk it has no idea which user the PBX is dealing with. 

Maybe some readers with E911 experience will write in to tell how they
deal with oddities such as you describe. One of the reasons I have not
bothered with CID Name and Number (we can now get this enhanced service
if we buy new Caller ID boxes) is that a friend who has it says there
is little consistency in how the listings come through. Residences are
almost always consistently correct, but the large companies with DID,
Centrex, humongous PBX's and other specialized arrangements are likely
to come through with the 'name' given as whatever someone punched in
when the order was being installed, if they bothered to punch in anything
at all. In a few cases here, entire prefixes although working show up as
'no information listed' when you try to cross-check through the Name and
Address service. And my friend with CID Name and Number service says
in the case of large companies calling him, quite often the number will be 
displayed as one of the lines used for outgoing calls with the 'name'
given as 'Unknown' or 'Not Listed' -- not to be confused with non-pub
numbers which are not listed with directory assistance but do show up
with name and number via Caller-ID.     PAT]

Subject: Latest ITU-T (CCITT) Country Code List
Date: Wed, 31 May 95 10:27:00 GMT


In surfing the ITU WWW & Gopher site, I looked at the latest Telephone 
Country Code List, NUM & ALPHA.

Here are some of the LATEST changes/assignments which may not have been 
discussed in previous in TELECOM Digest:

296 for Tr & Tob is NOT on it anymore - it NOW IS listed as '1' (Tr & Tob. 
was not previously included with '1' with the other 1-809 Carib.points)(296 
is now 'spare').

295 is gone.

The entire 87 series is reserved or used for Intl.Maritime/Mobile (871 thru 
874 USED, 875-879 reserved, 870 says reserved for InMarSat 'SNAC' trial).

Russia and five Central Asian former SSR's use 7.

Czech & Slovakia still share 42.

Comoros & Mayotte still share 269.

41 is still shared by Switz. & Liecht.

Greenland still 299.

Faroe still 298.

Aruba still 297.

382,3,4,8 are still 'spare'.

970,8,9 still 'spare' (altho' I DO remember that 15 years ago, 971 was UAE 
except for Abu-Dhabi(sp) and Dubai -- one was 978 and the other was 979).

969 is stated as 'reserved - but currently under investigation' -- Seems
as the unified Yemen will all have 967. (I know that one of the two
'former Yemens' was known at one time as Aden).

Of course, 886 is listed as 'spare' with Taiwan shown in a footnote as 86-6, 
part of (Red) China.

255 is Tanzania, while 259 is still listed as Zanzibar (Tanzania).

800 is still 'reserved' for future International FREEFONE.

0 is stated as 'Assignment not feasible until after Time-T, 31 Dec.96'.

There is still no assignment for Pitcairn Island (I would guess that it
will be 693 if ever assigned its own code), nor a seperate code for
'Sikkim' (a territory near Bhutan, India, Nepal, Red China -- but I am
never quite sure who it belongs to politically), nor Easter Island (but I
would think that it is part of Chile's code), nor any of those small
British Islands in the South Atlantic (probably would be part of 500
Falklands or maybe part of Ascension 247 or St.Helena 290), nor any
other small French Is.in the Indian Ocean.

For those interested, there are also updated lists for Telex country
codes, Data Network country codes, '89' International Telephone
Chargecard country/network/card-issuer codes, and Intl.SS7 network
codes (some are NUM only, some are ALPHA by country/network/region
only, and some have two seperate lists Numerical and Alpha).

These various code lists are as of December, 1994 thru May, 1995.

Subject: Synergy Semiconductor Attacks Speed Barriers w/ High Speed FIFOs
Date: 30 May 1995 20:24:34 GMT
Organization: Netcom


Synergy Semiconductor is now offering two, new ultra-high speed FIFO
(first in, first out) buffers. Both are 64 word - by - 18-bit
components.  The SY69167 performs one write OR one read operation at
up to 200 MHz (5ns cycle) and the SY69168 performs one write AND/OR
one read operation at up to 100 MHz (10ns cycle).  Both devices are
10KH ECL compatible.

These FIFO buffers are used in automatic test equipment as vector data
buffers, in telecommunications systems in data rate conversion
subsystems, and in computers for minimizing data skewing, and any
other system where high-speed data buffering is a critical requirement.

These new FIFO products offer designers several key design benefits. 
As wide-word devices, these products can buffer two parity-checked
bytes per chip.  Thus, designers need fewer devices, less board space,
and lower power supply, reducing overall design and production costs.

A single-clock synchronous design makes these two ECL FIFOs easier to
use while avoiding the complicated timing constraints imposed by the
more traditionally-used and lower-performance CMOS FIFOs.

The SY69167 and -168 are both single-stage pipeline designs with all
control and data signals registered on the rising edge of the clock. 
Thus, designers need only concern themselves with set up and hold
timing with reference to the clock.

All input signals are sampled on the rising edge of the clock and a
read or write operation begins during the next clock period.  All
output signals are driven by registers which are also clocked on the
rising clock edge.  Thus one read or one write operation can occur with
each clock cycle in the -167, or both operations in the -168.

Status flag logic provides empty, half full and full status flag
outputs.  In addition, there are interrupt outputs for overflow and
underflow conditions.  Chip initialization is easily done using the
reset input pin.  When pulled low, this pin initializes the device and
resets both read and write pointers to zero.  On-chip voltage and
temperature compensation circuitry provide improved noise margins.
Finally, the chip is designed for enhanced alpha-particle immunity.

Both the SY69167 and SY69168 are available in 64-pin QFPs, and are
priced at $125 in quantities of 1000.

Subject: Phone Line Voltage


I am having a problem with the phones in my house, I have about seven
extensions, with many different types of phones, such as a Panasonic,
Western Electric Princess, Northern Tel. 9516, ATT 8110.

Well the problem is:

I'll be talking on the Northern Tel 9516 phone,and then my wife
picks up the ATT 8110 phone, she gets NOTHING!! (a dead line);

and if shes on the ATT8110 phone and I pick up a phone (any phone)
the ATT 8110 goes dead ...

Also, if I put the call on HOLD (using the hold button on the Panasonic)
I sometimes can pick up the line from the ATT 8110 or even the WE Princess.

(Don't blame it on the ATT 8110, I just used it as an example.)

It seems that different phones draw different amounts of CURRENT when
on line and some phones need a certain voltage/current to work to pick
up the line.

So what is the minimum amount of voltage when the the line is in use?

I measured the following :

ATT 8110           7.11   v
NT 9516            6.61   v  
WE Princess        5.20   v  
Panasonic          10.76  v 

Now with the 9516 and 8110 the voltage droped to  5.58 v

and with the 8110 and Panasonic the voltage was   4.96 v
What can I do to solve this problem?

so now I connected 4+ phones and the voltage was  2.95 v

Please help me out.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I guess what you have to do is call the
Telephone Company and tell them to quit being so chintzy with the amount
of power they send down the line. Tell then you need at least a couple
more volts on a regular basis.   <grin>.

You are really pressing your luck with that much stuff -- and such a
variety at that -- on the line all at the same time. I am surprised
the bells even ring correctly when a call comes in.  

Do you have a second, or third phone line there? Try balancing the load
a little if you do, moving a couple of the phones using the most current
to another line and putting something simple in their place on the original
line.  Normally three or four instruments is the most you should have on
a single line.   

I guess another way of phrasing your question would be this: I have an
air-conditioner, a television, a microwave oven and a clothes washer
in my house, but the single circuit in my fuse box has a 15 amp fuse.
Why can't I stay cool watching television while I wash my clothes and
cook my dinner?  Someone told me about 30 amp fuses so I went and got
one of those and all my appliances kept right on running, even when I
was out one day and forgot to turn them off. Imagine my surprise to
get home and see the Fire Department there putting out the blaze started
by the overheated wiring. 

The Telephone Company sends you a certain amount of current. That's
it. Live with it.    PAT]

Interestingly, the telecommunications services (telex and cablegrams)

I think that ITT eventually divested its telecommunications operating
unit, but I don't know who acquired it. (ITT's telecom manufacturing

I think you are over engineering the solution.  This is for a school.
Most of the numbers that the kids have are POTS lines, nothing fancy
like pagers and the like.  Answering machines need to be dealt with,
true.  But generally the particular population might really benefit
from a cheap, somewhat reliable system, rather than no system.

I suspect you're not reading between the lines enough, Robert. Harold
was speaking of calling the students in a class to tell them it has
been cancelled. That sounds a lot more like a college than a grade-school, 
to me. So, first off there's the POTS question -- some of them likely
live in dorms on campus, so you've got the university pbx, if any, to
deal with as well. Second, pagers and the like are cheap and getting
cheaper.  Likewise voicemail services.

I think you'd find more of that kind of thing than you expect. And for
most of the issues I detailed, the type of service isn't too material
 -- it's what you get on the other end, no matter how you get there.

The students are going to want to be notified according to their schedules, 
not yours. That means, in all likelihood, at work sometimes.  You'll need to 
deal with secretaries, company pbx's, long hold times, voice attendants, 
extension numbers, and so forth.  Otherwise, you're just blurting the
message and hoping someone/something was there to get it, and hopefulling 
willing to deliver it (correctly) to the intended receiver.

A soccer game is one thing. A rescheduled class, another. One bit of
private feedback that I got from this, someone told me that if they
missed an important class because of something like this, they'd
probably sue the university. Can't blame 'em, myself.

The bottom line is, can you live with the failure rate you're likely
to get? For a lot of applications, yes. For this one, I don't think
so.  The 20-30% of people who show up for the cancelled class are
going to be upset, and downright angry if it happens a lot. And
suppose it's not a class, but a major exam? If you're willing to
accomodate those who say they didn't hear about the change, what's to
stop anyone from claiming that, and will you fade the heat from irate
faculty who have to deal with them, because of your system's
shortcomings?

Let's suppose you think  that you can. You put in the system, but later, 
when the stack of complaints and hate-mail overflows your in-basket, you 
decide you need to improve it. Can you, with the particular system you've 
chosen? What will it cost? Do you have the budget, or is it better to 
just cut your losses and scrap it?

How many people need to be notified and what amount of time does that 
take? What if you need more lines than you thought? Can you expand your 
budget system to handle more lines? What if your university rewires the 
phone system for a different pbx, maybe even a digital one? Can your 
budget system adapt? What will that cost?

There are some very important issues here, and I think they need more 
engineering, not less, to avoid unpleasant surprises later on.

Organization: Dynapro Systems Inc.

We need to exchange data between companies in Milwaukee and Vancouver.

Traffic is typically:

- email
- a few large file transfers daily (> 10M)
- IPX and IP protocols
- marginal telnet traffic

Function is to co-develop software between the two sites.

We felt that 112K of bandwidth would probably do the trick.  Suggestions 
were:

- dedicated lines? (Hopefully not. We don't need the line up ALL the 
time.  This is about $4K CDN/mo.)

- frame relay? (Throw in a T1 local loop, and run 112K frame relay.  
Sounds reasonable.  Users would be pissed if they didn't get close to 
112K bandwidth though.  Also, the company in Milwaukee doesn't seem very 
keen on frame relay for some reason).

- Switched 56?  (How about a couple of switched 56 lines?  I didn't get 
good vibes about this from BCTel or fONOROLA.  Additionally, how would 
you combine them?)

Any comments, suggestions for a relatively inexperienced WAN type would 
be appreciated.

The Progress and Freedom Foundation <pff@aol.com> in Washington has
released its plan to abolish the Federal Communications Commission.

Highlights from the "comprehensive plan" of particular interest
to wireless users:

* Unless Congress acts to preserve regulations, all FCC rules and
regulations will be rescinded in three years.

* Immediate repeal of all FCC licensing authority.

* All current FCC license holders would receive property rights in the
spectrum, enforced by the trespass laws.

* Deeds recorded in a central Spectrum Registry File.

* Any spectrum that has more than one claimant would be auctioned
within 180 days. Government would establish standardized spectrum
parcels for auction.

* Government agencies must "disgorge" their unused spectrum within
a determined timeframe.

* All restrictions on use of spectrum would be eliminated. Those who
win title could develop and/or re-sell the spectrum subject to
antitrust review and geographic and interference boundaries; however,
legislation would not set forth interference rights in detail.

* Department of Justice would confiscate any devices used in violation
of communications rules.

* Complaint investigation and answering of general inquiries from the
public discontinued.

* Spectrum above 300 GHz is infrared rather than radio.

Boy, what a horror story! 

Personally, I don't know why you would need digital phones in a hotel
room, especially since they normally don't have an analog port in them
to hook up a modem etc.

If you are a real upscale hotel, you may want to have two extensions
in each room, so that you could use a modem while being able to make
and receive calls. I don't recall that anyone makes a PBX with hotel
features that gives you a digital phone with an analog port, so that
both can be used simultaneously (but there may be one).

If you really need a new PBX (as in the old one is obsolete and no
longer supported -- or you've outgrown it), you may want to have your
vendor reconfigure his proposal for analog phones in the rooms -- that
way you would only need the analog station card -- not the digital.
Stick some nice single line feature phones with a bunch of speed dial
buttons in the rooms, preferably with a data port on them.

If your old PBX works fine, you may want to go out and buy 150 of
those nice feature phones, and get the same results for lots less
money. The people in the rooms won't have a clue of how old or how
messy your PBX is.

Personally, I wouldn't want to deal with a company that tried to do
this to me, but you may be able to make the most of it since it sounds
like your vendor is a pretty big company. In the interest of keeping
up their numbers, and not causing a lot of bad feelings, they may
offer you a discount to reconfigure to the above scenario (which
should cost a little less than the digital phones/cards anyway).
Salespeople seldom change their spots, so your vendor probably won't
be surprised about what your salesperson pulled.

If your old system works OK for now, there's nothing to push you into
accepting anything other than exactly what you want. If it takes them
six months to resolve the situation -- make the best of it!  Many
companies figure that they'll install the system, get their sales
numbers and deal with suing you later. I wouldn't let them do that if
I were you. Also, if you're leasing the system, don't sign the
acceptance (or anything that remotely looks like an acceptance), until
you're happy as hell. Once you sign an acceptance, the leasing company
has a perfect right to bill you and sue you. If you don't sign it,
they usually won't pay the vendor anything -- and will never start
billing you.

You can't plug any kind of single line phone into a port designed for
a digital phone. You may be able to kludge an adapter, or get a gizmo
that lets you hook up a single line device through the handset port (a
nice one is available through Vive Synergies in Canada). In a hotel,
it would be very difficult to keep track of these external devices.
Either the single line device, or less often the digital station port
on the PBX could be damaged if you plug the single line into the
digital jack. You'll really hate yourself in the morning if you go for
some half-assed solution!


Good luck,

Mike

The Meridian 1 is a nice switch.  It can take analog, proprietary-
digital, and ISDN extensions.  Each uses a different line card, and of
course the phone sets are different.

Somebody blew it Big Time!  You NEVER use digital extensions for things like 
fax and modems!  Those devices are built to work with analog lines ONLY.  
(There are "ISDN modems" and even a nice IBM PCMCIA ISDN card but it's
new and not yet common.)  I've never stayed at a hotel with digital
room phones.  The norm nowadays is an analog phone with a secondary
jack on the side and a message waiting light (good old 90v neon).

"Risk" is not the right word.  You are guaranteed 100% that an analog
modem, fax or other device will NOT work on a digital line!  It may
harm the modem, but is unlikely to harm the PBX, because most analog
devices do not generate power, but expect power from the analog line.
Note that it will not always harm the modem, but you don't want to
risk liability ...

> Are there any analog to digital converters available that can be

For a proprietary-digital interface, no.  That's likely what you have.
For an ISDN interface, there are terminal adapters like the Adak that
have analog outputs.  I doubt you have ISDN extensions, though.  PBX
vendors prefer proprietary, since they can run on one pair, are cheap,
and lock the customer in to that brand of PBX (when upgrade time
comes).

Pat's advice is good.  Check your contract.  Check your lawyer.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: My original advice was to make no further
payments -- if any had been made -- on this mess. It sounds like it might
be quite expensive to repair the problem. I suggested the writer could
sue the company to force the corrections needed, but he would have to
sue them in their jurisdiction most likely. He would be better off letting
them sue him for the balance due, since the company would have to come
to his location to do that, and once they sue for the remainder due then
the hotel can countersue without having to make a trip out of town to
wherever the company is located.  But the other person responding in this
thread today says waiting to get sued is not a good idea. I don't see why
not; even if its a third party leasing company handling the paper which 
claims it has already made the payout, a lot of courts won't give any
credence to 'holder in due course' arguments.  

I certainly agree with Fred that the hotel should seek legal counsel
on this as soon as possible if anything has been signed or the work
has commenced.  Otherwise, sign *nothing* and the next time a
representative from the company shows up have your security staff show
him the door and how to open it going outward.  PAT]

My understanding is that Nortel is the new name for Northern Telecom, thus

Are you dealing with Northern directly, or is in fact your maintainer
a distributor? If the latter, you should put the heat on Northern.  If
the former complain to the Richardson, Texas headquarters.

Well, yes and no.  The format of an international number is:

(dialing prefix)  -- depends on country of origin; e.g., 011, 00, etc.
(country code)    -- 1, 2, or 3 digits
(city code)       -- 0 to 6 digits
(local number)    -- 1 to 8 digits

The maximum total number of digits in the last three segments is 12, but
is scheduled to increase to 15 digits in the not-too-distant future.

There are other rules which can be invoked when the country code has
been parsed; for example, numbers in Denmark are always the two-digit
country code, no city code, and an 8-digit local number.  In the U.S.,
Canada, and other parts of World Zone 1, the location can be fairly
precisely specified by the country code (1), city code (3-digit area
code) and prefix (first 3 digits of the local number).

However, for billing for fax calls, you probably only need to account
for parsing the country code.  Look at the first three digits after the
international dialing prefix and you're home.  You can invoke more
detailed rules for domestic calls, to whatever extent your costs vary by
location.

So we can now add the new "760" area to the very exclusive list of
areas that will have had three different area codes since 1980.
As best I can figure it, the others are:

847 and 630 - Illinois - were 312, now 708, splitting again
562 - California - areas that were 213, now 310, splitting again

 ... and that's pretty much it, I think.

The 760 area was, of course, part of 714 until that code split in half
in 1982, with San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange counties getting
714, and the rest going 619.  (SB and Riverside later split themselves, 
to 909).

Great book.  I cut my teeth on that one, after having been loaned the

Here's some info from George Oslin's book.  There is a picture of the
statue, with the caption "The Genius of Electricity (later renamed the
Spirit of Communication) was a familiar figure on the New York skyline.  

Then a reference to another picture of the building at 195 Broadway,
NYC, with the caption "Western Union headquarters building, 195
Broadway, New York.  The gold-winged figure at the peak of the tower
is "Genius of Electricity", erected October 24, 1916, the 55th
anniversary of the completion of the first transcontinental telegraph.
When W.U. sold its half ownership of the building to AT&T, AT&T
renamed it the "Spirit of Communications".

Then there is some text:

  "Western Union invited sculptor Evelyn Beatrice Longman to design a
statue symbolizing the Genius of Electricity to top the Fulton Street
tower on its 195 Broadway headquarters, built in 1875.  The result was
a twenty four foot high bronze statue of a man with a twelve foot wing
span, standing on a large globe.  One arm held cables; the other hand,
held high, grasped darting lightning bolts, representing electrity
that powers telecommunications.  The statue was erected on October 24,
1916, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the first transcontinental
telegraph line.

  "In 1930, Western Union sold its interest in the building to AT&T,
which rechristened the statue the Spirit of Communications, gilded it
with more than 12,500 pieces of gold leaf, and called it 'Golden Boy'.
In 1980 AT&T moved the statue to its new headquarters at 550 Madison
Avenue.  For sixty-four years at 195 Broadway the statue was the second
largest sculpture in New York, higher than the 151-foot Statue of
Liberty, and a familiar sight to millions."

The book I'm quoting from is "The Story of Telecommunications" ISBN
0-86554-418-2, by George P. Oslin, (age 93) the former public
relations director for Western Union, published by Mercer University
Press.  I'll say the book is a mess, especially toward the end; but
I'm glad the old man took the time to write it.  It could have used a
lot better editing -- but then the publisher mostly publishes religious
books so probably lacks an editor qualified for this topic.

The winged statue called "Spirit of Communication" or "Golden Boy" was
moved at some point to atop the building at 550 Madison Avenue, also
in New York City.  But a couple years ago when AT&T leased the
building at 500 Madison to Sony, the statue was moved to a pedestal in
front of corporate headquarters in Basking Ridge, NJ.  (I get to see
it every day out the window).  As part of the latest move it was given
a much needed restoration.

 Beatrice Longman and has stood in New York since 1916.  Mrs. Longman's
 design was selected by the president of AT&T at that time, Theodore N.
 Vail; the architect of the old AT&T headquarters building in lower
 Manhattan, William Welles Rosworth; and noted American sculptor Daniel
 Chester French after a nationwide competition in 1914 to develop an
 AT&T corporate symbol.

Some of Golden Boy's statistics:
Height of Bronze Figure : 24 Feet
Granite Base            : 21 Feet
Weight                  : 32,000 pounds
Wing Span               : 23 Feet
Gilding                 : 23 Karat Gold

Subject: Book Review: "Being Digital" by Nicholas Negroponte
Date: 31 May 1995 09:01:25 GMT
Organization: Alcatel CIT Le Pecq, France


Since 1993 through the present time, I have been searching for books
which present the upcoming information superhighways. Unfortunately,
all the papers and magazines were repeatedly chattering about the same
topics. A lot of them present rather policital views with no precise
action plans. Others present some telecom technologies as the
milestone of the information superhighway building, i.e., ATM, SDH,
ASDL, etc. Of course, VOD is still the hot stuff that every one is
talking about.

Thus, I was always frustrated after reading and reading the same thing
written many different ways. That was before I read Being Digital,
Nicholas Negroponte's last book on the future of digital products and
services.  

First of all, the book is a good starting point for many directions,
be it technical, economical, or social. Its reading is really funny: I
read it in less than a week, though I have done so only at home after
a full day of work.

As an ex-researcher in Artificial Intelligence and presently engineer
in the telecommunications industry, I focused my attention on the
technical aspects of the book. I also found that I learned many new
things from a social and commercial point of view. 

It provides a deep analysis of the current status of multimedia
(Negroponte simply identifies it as the melding of bits) and where
more work needs to be done. In particular, the book shows where the
present R&D in HDTV IS now and where it SHOULD be. From my point of
view, this part of the book is the most important if not the
major one. I highly recommend its reading to all those working on
services such as visual browsing, information searching. Negroponte
suggests that such services should be based on what he calls the
bits-on-bits (information on the content of a digital stuff).

I also appreciated the interface part. It shows where AI in general
and intelligent agents can have an industrial come-back and play a
terrific role. Instead of searching, just program your interface
agents and it's up to them to do the work based on your centers of
interest. I highly recommand the reading of this part to those
reseachers looking for challanging but not toy problems for their AI
models and systems. I'm really sure that AI may help in the future of
the Internet surfing. 

The only thing which I found missing in this book is the refernces of
the research going on in institutions (e.g., MIT Media Lab). This will
help "thirsty" readers, like me, to follow where their developments
will lead us. 

Finally, I will end my review by asking Negroponte "When will Volume
II be ready?"

I found the second edition of this book to be quite useful. Since
almost nothing changed for the third edition, it's still useful, but
somewhat out of date.

For instance, there are still full chapters on rn and vnews, but tin?
trn? Naaaaaaah ...

The appendix on transfer protocols still thinks xmodem and kermit is
all there is.  (One could argue that Kermit _is_ all there is).

I didn't buy it. Go to remainder sales and look for the second edition
instead.

Although I'm in the callback business maybe would like some experience
from the other side of the globe:

I'm a MTC Passport representative in The Netherlands for over one year
now with about 60 happy clients. Why are my clients happy? Because the
rates of our Dutch PTT are about twice the rates of MTC Passport to
most countries. My clients call the USA, Australia, Israel, Netherlands 
Antilles, Aruba, South Africa, Iran, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc. MTC
Passport is located in the USA and they are offering a product to
customers all over the world. You can imagine this would be very
expensive to have offices all over the world. I guess that is why they
contract (small) local agents like me in The Netherlands who give rate
information and sign up forms to customers who are interested in low
international telephone rates.

If you have any further questions you can email me at:
72763.1306@compuserve.com  

BTW: I also have a client in Australia who seems happy with the
Passport service.

Stay away from Vartec!  I signed up with them, when their promotion
was "get every tenth call for one cent.  I compared the probabilities
and such, and they looked to be the best deal I could find.  I
switched all seven lines in my house to them (I used to run a BBS).
Anyway, a few months later I decided to switch to MCI.  I had them
switch all my lines.  After a few days, I checked my lines by dialing
00 and asked the operator what company they were.  They all were MCI.
About two days later I needed a long distance operator for something or
other and I got the VarTec operator.  I was puzzled at this, and it
seems that five of my lines had mysteriously been switched over to
Vartec.  I then called MCI, explained my situation and they switched
the lines again to MCI.  They were switched over to MCI, and after two
days, they went back to Vartec.  After this, I called Vartec and asked
to talk to a supervisor, and threatened legal action.  I then called
Ameritech and told them not to let Vartec switch it again.  Anyway,
Vartec caused me a lot of trouble switching the lines and getting back
the switchover fee.  As a side note, the MCI rep said that Vartec is
notorious for this.  I'd be very careful when dealing with these
folks.

This sounds like a perfect application for Spread-Spectrum radio.  I
know Black Box sells stuff for this.  Basically you just put an antenna
on each building, and you get 2mbps, no FCC licensing.  Furthermore,
you can get a data compression box on each end and get about 3.5mbps
out of it.  That should be more than enough speed considering that's
1/3 of ethernet.

I found this related article in the WSJ:

SPECTRUM AUCTION PLANS MAY ACCELERATE

House Republicans are considering a Congressional Budget Office
recommendation to auction television broadcasters' existing analog
channel spectrum seven years from now as part of a plan to balance the
budget by 2002.  By that time, they hope that most broadcasters will
have moved over to new digital-broadcasting channels.  Current FCC
plans provide broadcasters the new digital channels for free, allow
them to use both digital and analog channels for 15 years, after which
time the analog channel spectrum will be returned to the government.
Speeding the auction process up, although onerous to the broadcasting
community, would still be less drastic than another suggested
alternative, which would force broadcasters to pay billions for the
digital channels in the first place.  (Wall Street Journal 5/24/95 B8)

Subject: Re: I Just Bought a CT2 Phone and I Love It
Date: Tue, 30 May 1995 20:24:45 +0200


My article about my new CT2 phone generated quite a few messages in my
mailbox from various people asking various questions. Since this seems of
some interest for DIGEST readers, I thought I'd take the time to answer
them here for the benefit of us all.


What is CT2?

CT2 is a standard for cordless phones. It is digital and operates in the
900 MHz range. Anyone cares to give more details?


What CT2 handset do I own?

It is sold by France Telecom, holds the "SAGEM" sticker (a French Telecom
company), but is in fact a Motorola Silverlink 2000 product. It is sold
$200 in France (this may sound expensive, but remember that all telecom
products and services are a lot more expensive in France and Europe than in
the USA).


What CT2 Private Base do I own?

A Motorola Silverlink 3020. It is sold $380 in France.


What is Bi-Bop?

Bi-Bop is the commercial name of the telepoint service offered by France
Telecom which let's you use your CT2 handset in the street. This service is
available in and around Paris, in Strasbourg and Lille. France Telecom did
install many base stations (several thousands). Actually, there are so many
that I don't bother looking at the map they gave me when I intend to use my
phone in the street: I simply count on getting the dial tone, and most of
the time, it works!

Bi-Bop lets me call any number, as long as I'm within the coverage area.
Bi-Bop also lets me receive phone calls (this is optional). Because
receiving calls is not straightforward (there is no automatic location
updating), incoming calls will, most of the time, hit my voice mail. Every
time I try to use my phone, I'm notified if someone left a message and I
can retrieve it very easily.

In one word, Bi-Bop is definitely neither as convenient nor as powerful as
a real cellular phone, but the latter are still a lot more expensive than
Bi-Bop, which explains why Bi-Bop has gained some popularity here (there
are around 80,000 Bi-Bop subscribers I believe).

How much does Bi-Bop cost?

Currently, I pay $10/month to subscribe to Bi-Bop, and all my calls
(outgoing AND incoming) cost me $0.20/min extra. I also pay $6/month to
enable incoming phone calls and have a voice mailbox.

A new plan was recently introduced: the extra cost for communications is
$0.35/min, but there is no monthly fee. This is obviously targetting
occasional users (like me!).

Are there other telepoint services anywhere?

Hong kong has a big CT2 public network.
The Netherlands has quite a big CT2 public network ("Greenpoint").
England had four but they are not operational anymore.
Germany had plans to start one but gave it up.
A private operator is about to open another CT2 public network in Bordeaux,
France.
Anyone has more info about these networks, or others?

Some roaming agreements were signed, at least between Bi-Bop and
Greenpoint.

That's it for today!

CT2 would have been a financial suicide in many countries -- here in
Finland, DECT has taken its place in local area networks, and GSM in
national and international level (~700 000 subscribers in the
population of 5.1 million).  CT2 (known as _Pointer_) was aborted
shortly after its introduction as technically and commercially
unsound.

I would suggest GSM for you too if only the cost of use in France was decent.

I have compiled a short listing of European digital cellular networks'
rates.  The listing has at the moment only prices from Finland, Sweden
and UK. I would appreciate all information from the other countries
using GSM or DCS180

You may want to look into wireless to connect the sites. One possible
solution is to use SOLECTEK's AIRLAN that will connect sites up to
three miles at 2Mb/s (vs your current 28.8Kb/s. You can reach them at
800-437-1518, ext. 3900. (I have not used this product and do not
vouch for the effectiveness of providing a solution).

Nortel/Northern are now the same company.  Northern has had a history
of bad customer support.  In fact, during most of the late 80's, they
did not even deal directly with users, only the distributors.

Try Wiltel.  They have an excellent TAC center and I have had fairly
good luck with them.

Subject: Troubles Retrieving Voice Mail in NYC
Date: Wed, 31 May 1995 21:39:33 EDT


Just wanted to share my troubles of retrieving my voice mail from a public
pay phone in NYC:

I went up to a NYNEX pay phone with the keys even with the covering
metal plate and called the main number for my voice mail via
10288-0-516-877-xxxx *bong* <calling card + PIN>. After entering the
mailbox number and the * key, the phone hangs up on me. Hmm. So I
repeat the process. Same thing. Then I tried 1-800-321-0ATT *bong*
516-877-xxxx *bong* <calling card + PIN>. This time I got to enter my
mailbox number, * key and passcode, then a disconnect. So I tried a
different phone (same style phone though). Same thing. Coin call.
Same thing. Frustration builds as I know by now that I *do* have
messages but get disconnected before I can retrieve them.

I finally walked up to a NYNEX phone with *raised* keys and did not
have any problems via calling card. This all happened within two blocks
of 6th Ave and 10th Street. Anyone have a clue what went on here?

A manager I had worked with at Bell Atlantic had once been put into
service as a PSTS operator in Norfolk, VA, during a strike, and
handled calls from coin telephones.  Unfortunately, the training she
got for the position was less than adequate and -- you guessed it --
for her first full day on the post, she hit the wrong button *every
time* she handled a call.  Everyone who completed a call got money
back, and everyone who failed had their money taken.  Nothing like
getting the public interested in a quick settlement!

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: In days of old ... when coin phones had
three slots on the top for money (25/10/5) and coin return slots without
the trap door on the front as they have had now for many years, customers
used to retrieve their own coins from the collection table in the phone,
sometimes even to reuse the same coins for the 'additional deposit' the
operator was demanding. 

The old payphones just had a little cup down at the bottom where the
coins fell into it when you got your money back, and less than honorable
people knew you could take something like a coat hanger or any piece of
stiff wire bent the correct way and stick it up the chute where the coins
fell out. Carefully probing with your stiff piece of wire up the chute,
when you reached the table in there, the object was to cause it to tip
in your favor so the coins would tumble out before the operator got around
to tipping it in her favor. For local calls it was no problem since the
money was simply held on the table until the call was finished at which
point the coin would dump in the box. So in the middle of your call, you
stalled for time with the person you were talking to while you got your
probe up there and tip the table enough to get the coin back.  On a long
distance call -- or any call where an operator was on the line supervising
the collection, care had to be taken to not get her wise to what was
going on. Let's say the long distance call cost $2.00.  For domestic
calls -- the norm -- where the table could hold the entire payment, it
would stay there until it was all put in and your party answered, just
in case the operator had to give it badk (person to person and the called
party not available, etc.) 

So you would put four quarters in, and pause ... start working on the
table with that little wire stuck up the chute. Meanwhile the operator
was demanding more money, "another dollar please!" ... you'd say,
"just a minute operator! I am looking for more change ... '  <grin> ...
you would get the coins back you started with, and give them all to
the operator a second time.  Yeah right, looking for more change ...

If the operator suspected hanky-panky or thievery of some kind, she
would hit that collect key in a hurry and dump all the coins in the
box before you could get them back out ... and the long time operators
recognized the voices of the children who were the main perpetrators
of the fraud. I got suspended from junior high school for two days
when the cafeteria supervisor at school caught me teaching a couple
other boys how to do it.  The cafeteria pay phone was on a completely
manual exchange; a five cent coin got you an operator who asked 'number
please?' and the idea was to liberate that nickle from the innards of
the phone before the operator got around to collecting it when your
call was finished.   PAT]

Sorry you haven't got a Field & Stream for a while but things got
hectic with finals and preparing for ISLIP 95 all coinciding.

Anyway I just got back from Australia and I'm pleased to say that
ISLIP95 was a real success. (ISLIP is the annual Lucid/Intensional
programming conference, held this year at Macquarie University in
Sydney Australia, 3-5 May).

Obviously not everyone from N. America was able to attend and there
was some concern. However, the concerns proved groundless. It was one
of the most successful ISLIPs ever, whether in terms of attendance,
variety of topics, quality of presentations, and geographical
diversity.

There were authors/presenters from: 

AUSTRALIA/NZ:
  Griffith University,  University of Adelaide, University of Queensland, 
  Macquarie University, Australian National University, University of 
  Canberra, University of Canterbury (New Zealand), 

SINGAPORE:
  Nanyang Technological University

JAPAN:
  Teikyo Heisei University, Shimane University 

EUROPE
  Verimag (France), IRSIP/CNR (Italy), 

N AMERICA
  University of Laval, University of Victoria (Canada), SRI, 
  Arizona State, Notre Dame (US),

Topics included 

 - Dataflow/Parallelism, 
 - Intensional logic programming (modal, temporal), 
 - Real time/ reactive systems, 
 - Higher order functions,
 - Program verification,
 - Versions 
 - Object-oriented programming
 - The Web

Mehmet Orgun (Macquarie) did an great organizing ISLIP95, There was 
general agreement that the three day format made it easier to take in. Also,
everyone appreciated the informative "Introduction to Intensional Programming"
(by John Plaice) which opened the Symposium.

We were all grateful to Macquarie University and the MPCE department
who supported the Symposium with excellent facilities, high quality
contributions, and incisive comments and questions from the floor.

Finally, let me give a plug for Sydney Australia - a cosmopolitan city
in a spectacularly beautiful setting. With great restaurants; my own
favorite being the Erciyes Turkish restaurant on Cleveland St in
Surrey Hills. (Disclaimer: I have received no considerations for this
endorsement, though I wouldn't say "no" to a nice Iskender Kebab ... :-)

In the next F & S I'll discuss some of the technical highlights.

The PBX can be the solution to your problem.

Proctor & Associates makes a product that solves this problem with 911
calls from PBXs.  It is called PBX ANI, and here is how it works:
 
Our product connects to your PBX, and all 911 calls are routed via our
box, instead of going through your regular PBX trunks.  We generate
your own dedicated 911 trunks that go to the answering point, and we
also generate the ANI in standard format, just like a regular 911 or
TSPS trunk.  At the other end (the Public Safety Answering Point, or
PSAP) our dedicated trunks hook up to the PSAP equipment just like
any other 911 trunk.
 
With 911 calls, the ANI is sent from the originating CO in a 7 digit
MF format.  The number is matched with a location using an ALI
(Automatic Location Identification) database at the PSAP end.
 
With PBX ANI, you supply the location information for your PBX
extensions to the folks who administer the ALI database so that all
of the extensions in your system show up with a real location.  In
the case where you do not have DID (Direct Inward Dial, where each
PBX extension has its own 7 digit phone number) you work with the
local telco to assign phony, non-dialable 7 digit numbers to
each extension which are just used for ANI signaling and ALI
database purposes.
 
The reason we use dedicated trunks for this is that there is no
way to send ALI or changed ANI information over a regular POTS
line or PBX trunk on top of a 911 call.  If there were a way to
do this, then hackers would have a field day spoofing locations
on 911 calls.
 
For more information on the PBX ANI product, contact Proctor & Associates
at 206-881-7000, or call Russ McCarthy at 714-770-0443.

Sort of.  According to a friend of mine, NYNEX has long been known to
be (overly) cooperative with law enforcement.  What you describe has
something to do with the fact that when you dial the number, the
payphones sending the dialed number to the police are not fast enough
to hear all the digits you dial, or their buffer gets overflowed, or
somehow they cannot receive all the data, so it just hangs up on you.
Dial slower.  But I try dialing slower and that sometimes works,
sometimes does not.  I think the theory is also to prevent people from
using pagers.  I just keep trying.  Certain payphones are much more
annoying in this regard than others.

Each and *every* time this happens to me, I arrange for a credit to be
sent from NYNEX to me for the amount I lost (just dial "0" (operator)
from the payphone where you lost your money, or another payphone; also
hit "#" to speed up the connection); if that so happens to be the cost
of a call on my cellular phone, well so be it, they send me a credit
for that amount, and I say that the NYNEX payphone ate that amount in
coins just so we don't have to discuss the matter.  It's best to have
it done to a home phone number if you can in terms of billing because
those checks are so annoying, but when I was between billing accounts
I had them send me checks instead.  (In either case logging each loss
would be a good idea; I should but don't.)

I sent two $.25 checks in for payment with my NYNEX bill one time, and
they forgot to credit one (the other took 10 days more than the main
money order, which took about two or three weeks.)  I was so mad at
them not crediting my account with it that I made four different
billing resentatives track down what happened to it, and about two or
three months later they finally adjusted my bill for the twenty-five
cents.  I was "overdue" by this .25 for a long time and received
disconnect notices, etc. (although the disconnect notices may have
indeed been based on their late processing of the main money order).

I make them eat their own cooperation in terms of the inconvenience it
causes me.  Obviously someone someplace thinks it's worth their while
for me and their company to go through all this extra fighting and
trouble.  Whatever, I still won't let them get me over on this one,
besides the unpreventable loss in time it causes for me to deal with
this all; just part of living in New York I assume (if it weren't for
NYNEX, New York wouldn't be such a bad place).

BTW, I have no surcharge calling cards; these things happen to me when
I use a coin or a TLC prepaid card to (a) check voicemail (b) page
somebody (usually people I'm emotionally attached to) or (c) dialing a
number or two using my prepaid card.

Even with all this trouble, NYNEX payphones are far and away better
than the COCOTs.  (Should I say "not as bad as"??)  Even when normal
phones say things like "1-800-555-1212 is not a number reachable from
this area."  (I always look up and say, "Gee, has midtown Manhattan
been declared a different country?")

Oops I forgot to realize during this post that when I make billing
representatives spend hours looking for twenty-five cents, NYNEX
includes this in their "cost of providing local service" to the PSC
and the PSC allows NYNEX to pass the cost (surprise!) along to the
rate payer.

I still want *my* twenty-five cents.  If some complacent little old
lady (using my social security money and my bank interest payments)
has to pay more because I want *my* twenty-five cents, all the better.
In the case where my peers have to eat the charge, well, I can't
really say I'm winning much.  Hmm.  Maybe that's why most people don't
ask for their credits ...

Good luck.  This is a supposed "anti-drug" technique that Nynex uses
in cooperation with law enforcement officials to deter the use of
pagers for drug deals.  I tried my best a couple of years ago to do
something about it and failed.

Even a pocket tone generator won't help you.  These phones are set up
to detect tones _not_ generated by the phone's keypad, too, and will
disconnect you after some number of tones (with special emphasis on
the * and # keys).

It surely must be illegal for Nynex to be monitoring my conversation
and disconnecting me when they don't like what they hear (the tones),
but neither Nynex, AT&T or the FCC seems interested in this.  AT&T
will credit me for calls disconnected because of this "feature,"
though.

My solution has been to use Nynex phones _inside_ business establishments, 
which are less likely to be crippled.  I don't think the physical appearance 
of the phone will give you a clue.

phone will not give a clue' then are you saying this is a central office

In can.general, Lester Hiraki complains about and opposes :

> .. decisions by the Canadian Radio-television and
> Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) .. have allowed telephone
> companies to make touch-tone service mandatory. ..

Note: "touch-tone" = brand-name for DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency).
"tone dialing" vs. "pulse dialing" is better simple usage.

I would like someone with telcom switching knowledge (perhaps a reader
of comp.dcom.telecom, where I have cross-posted this) to give some
technical enlightenment on this.  Please reply to can.general .

    My (limited and perhaps flawed) understanding is that, where the
subscriber has a choice between pulse or tone dialing, there are NOT
two parallel switching systems at the central office, one for pulse
and one for tone, with the pulse system being cheaper.  Rather, the
switching system is tone based, with DTMF tone dialing being the
primary presentation of the system to the subscriber.  The alternate
presentation of pulse dialing is a secondary "front end" for backwards
compatibility with older systems. (Going all the way back to Mr.
Strowger's techno-response to his competitor's wife being the town's
switchboard operator.)  Pulse dialed numbers are stored and then
emitted as a tone burst into the tone switched system.

   Thus, if the above is basically true, the "extra charge" for a tone
subscriber line is a legal-economic artifact.  It is costing the
telcom more to provide pulse dialing and this is not being reflected
in the charge differential between those who have a pulse dialing only
line and those who have a tone dialing line and do not use the pulse
dialing option. (The latter are fast becoming the vast majority).

The issue is not really one of making tone dialing mandatory as much
as it is asking for removal of support for obsolete pulse dialing.

   In theory, the dropping of pulse dialing support should take the
following form:

[1] All "pulse dialing only" subscriber lines are "upgraded" to
    tone dialing at no charge for specifically that upgrade.

[2] Simultaneously, there is a change in regulated subscriber rates.
    Should this appear as an increase to previous "pulse dialing only"
    subscribers and a tiny decrease (if any) to "tone dialing with the
    hardly ever used option of pulse dialing" subscribers, then it is
    _not_ a trick to make more $ , but rather an economically rational
    removal of a subsidy.

[3] Owners/renters of pulse-only telephones are given the choice of
    (a) bearing the responsibility and cost of upgrading the equipment
        at their (subscriber) end of the line, or,
    (b) paying for conversion equipment at the central office end of the
        line.
    Of course, (a) will be so much cheaper that there will be no demand
    for (b).

Subject: Long-Distance Carriers and LEC's


Hi all!

     A few years ago, AT&T introduced a service called "VoiceMark"
that would allow a user to record a message and have it delivered to
the destination phone number of choice.  This service was improved and
later renamed "True Messages."  The service continues to expand, and
is now being offered to many users of AT&T's 1-plus service (as
opposed to Calling-Card users only, as was true in the past.

     No doubt, all of you are more than familiar with the services and
other "store-and-forward" services offered by other companies.  I
mention this service in order to point out my recent experiences with
AT&T after ALLTel began providing local service to my area.

     When GTE served our area, we could usually take advantage of new
services offered by AT&T and other long-distance carriers shortly
after the "Baby-Bells" got them.  MCI and Sprint were even offering
"BOC" billing to us.  After ALLTel began serving our area, AT&T (and
other carriers to a lesser or greater extent) could no longer offer
certain services because of having no agreement with ALLTel for them.

     To illustrate:

     I heard about using "True Messages" from a 1-plus line if the
service was subscribed for.  I decided to try it, and since there was
still some confusion as to who my LEC (Local Exchange Carrier) was, AT&T
added the service to my number.  Next day, I got a call from the AT&T
rep who appologized, but, the service was not available to ALLTel
customers and would have to be removed.  I *NEVER* saw AT&T remove a
service as fast as when they found out their mistake in my case :-).
The service was disabled within about an hour after I got the call.

     If GTE still served my area, I could take advantage of this
service, and the "True Connections" service (Which I used as a GTE
subscriber under the name "Easy-Reach").  Other AT&T programs have
been affected, and Long-Distance Carriers (such as MCI and Sprint) do
not seem to be able to offer "BOC" billing on my regular phone bill.

     Anyone have any suggestions as to how I can use the latest
services from the LD Carriers without moving to a major metropolitan
area?  It puzzles me that a company like AT&T (for example) cannot
offer the kind of service it should be able to just because a LEC
can't handle the billing.  I spoke with a member of management at AT&T
who thought he had come up with a solution to this problem.  Simply
set up independent billing arrangements with AT&T and have them bill
me for everything.  This service, however, is not offered in Georgia,
and so that idea fell through.  Maybe when there's competition between
LEC's, I'll be able to use some of the newer services which shouldn't
have much to do with the LEC anyway, although, I bet that opening a
local market to other LEC's is going to be a lot of fun (well, maybe
fun is too strong a word:-).  Any of you had similar experiences?


Thanks!

Subject: Bell Canada Files Rates For Business Local Measured Service


Bell Canada announced yesterday (31st May) the tariffed rates sought
for their business local measured service plan. Bell wants approval to
have the charges in place for 1st July 1997, with a prior year-long
"shadow" billing that will inform business customers of how much they
would pay if local measured service were in effect.

This originally began with a CRTC Letter Decision allowing Bell to
harmonise PBX and Key system rates. The result would be that Bell
could file a "threshold" pricing plan affecting all business lines.
The "threshold" plan would have meant that a certain amount of local
calling would be available for a local monthly rate, after which local
measured charges would be applied.

A Business Customer Advisory Panel was subsequently set up by Bell.
This group of representatives from selected small, medium and large
organisations would advise Bell regarding the proposed local rates
revamp. "While the Panel did not support the concept of local measured
service," stated the Bell tariff notice text, "most members felt that
a simplified structure, without a usage threshold, would be
preferable". The panel's reasons, as listed by Bell, were that this
would be easier to manage, would ensure costs only pay for local calls
made, and would minimise cross-subsidisation of heavy users by low
volume users. Bell now seeks straight local measured tariffs without
that initial threshold.

Bell Canada Tariff Notice 5506 contains the specifics of Bell's
Business Exchange Measured Service filing. "TelecomLink" will be the
buzzword given to this fundamental change in local phone service
billing. All of the following are proposed tariff revisions that
require CRTC approval and could be altered or rejected in the process.

Some of the highlights:

* Business 2-party service will be upgraded to individual line service.

* The former "Business Message Rate" service applicable in some business 
line cases would be withdrawn in favour of the new pay-per-call scheme.

* 4-party customers would still have a constant monthly local service rate

* Business lines in some northern points, served by exchanges in rate
group 3A, will retain flat-rated local service. These are for
exchanges in northern Ontario or Quebec whose local calling areas are
counted at 1500 phone numbers or fewer, where installation of local
measuring would not be worthwhile.

* Proposal is similar to Ameritech's scheme in Illinois.

The Charges:

The local call charges will depend on the distance between the origin
and destination exchange "wire centres", similar to how long distance
calling is measured (V&H co-ordinates and all). The four bands and
their costs per minute are:

0-15 km    $0.015/min
16-30 km   $0.020/min
31-45 km   $0.035/min
46+ km     $0.055/min

Charging begins with an initial 30 second period (ie. half the
per-minute cost), then charges occur in 6 second increments (each
increment would be one- tenth the per-minute cost). Thus, if you're on
the phone to a local supplier where the rate distance is in the 16-30
km range, and you're on hold for 20 minutes, the call would cost 20 x
$0.020 or 40 cents in peak times (plus applicable taxes).

Discounts would be available depending on the time of day and day of
week. Local charges from 5 pm to 11 pm weekdays would be discounted
10%; local calls between 11 pm and 8 am any day are discounted 30%;
local calls throughout the weekend (from Friday 11pm until Monday 8am)
would also be discounted 30%.

There are discounts proposed for volume usage, starting at $10 of
local usage per month. The percentage of these discounts increases
according to the amount of local usage incurred per month.

Initially, there would be a $60 cap on local usage charges each month,
but Bell will increase this cap and eventually eliminate this limit
after 4.5 years. For competing long distance providers using "line-side" 
access, this would mean expected increased costs of 1.6-5.7% initially, 
eventually reaching a 16.4-19.9% increase when the price cap is gone.

I have the 25 pin connector, but I need to know which pins to short.

I looked through all of the Telecom Archives and could not find the answer.

pin which needs to be held low to go into so-called 'local mode'. It was
a simple enough job in the Radio Shack 25-pin gender changer to drop a
bit of solder judiciously between the two pins connecting them. Then to
get into local mode, you pull the battery off, slide in the modified 25-

of the connector.  That brings the phone up 'local'. Then you set the

Inside it says that we are guaranteed savings 25% below AT&T, MCI, and

"rates and guarantee detailed in Dial and Save FCC tariff #1" I called
the number they provide for customer service 800-787-3333 for specific

stated "I'm not going to go over your phone bill for you."  I said
"You can't give me specific rates?"  She hung up stating "Thank you

I guess AT&T, MCI, and Sprint may not be so bad ... they did list a

Subject: Gate Intercom Tied to Private Phone
Reply-To: xdab@midway.uchicago.edu
Organization: University of Chicago -- Academic Information Technologies
Date: Thu, 1 Jun 1995 02:43:44 GMT


I hope this does not result in a flame war, but I am interested in the
collective wisdom of the net on the following topic.

The condo association where I live is in the process of installing a
new intercom system between the front gate (fronting on the street)
and the individual units in the association. The system will consist
of a "phone" at the front gate programmed to speed dial the phone
numbers of the residents' apartments. Thus someone at the gate will
l1G$press, e.g., 02, the unit will go off-hook and dial my land-line phone
number (or any number I tell them, I guess). If the number dialed is
busy, the person at the gate is SOL unless the individual's phone line
is programmed with call waiting. Then the individual on the phone
would be notified of a call, but a modem call would be knocked
off-line (and sending *70 at the beginning of the modem session still
leaves the user blissfully unaware of someone at the gate). The system
which is being replaced is a hard-wired intercom (speaker/microphone
at the gate and in the unit) that is hard to maintain and repair. At
the moment, however, I can be connected to the net, and still know
when the pizza guy has arrived.

I wonder how many people and/or buildings have these "phone" units?
How reliable are they? I guess the answer to this question will
ultimately be how will it stand up to the elements and vandalism?

But more on my mind is how do net users who live in buildings so
equipped deal with modems, etc. on the line "tied" to the gate?
Currently, I do not have call waiting, so incoming calls do not knock
me off line in the middle of a session. I do have Ameritech provided
Voice Mail, so messages can be left for us if my wife or I am using
the modem or using the phone. Will a call generated at the gate ring
through to a answering machine or voice mail if not canceled by the
individual at the gate? I would think it would, so I will then have to
pay real money to listen to people at the gate after the fact. Do you
"just live with this state of affairs" and just accept the fact that
when the phone line is in use you will not know anything about what is
happening at the gate?

Some thoughts I have had about the situation: 

        *I have a phone installed in my unit for my convenience and
        use. Since the condo association currently supplies the
        intercom service, the condo association should supply a pots 
        line for this new service.

        *While I do not have an unlisted phone number, some residents
        in the building do. They are not pleased to have to turn their 
        number over to the management company to have the unit 
        programmed for speed dialing. How should one respond to their
        concerns? 

        *What should be the association's response to an (hypothetical,
        as far as I know) individual who does not have/want a phone
        in their unit? Does the condo association have a responsibility
        to provide the unit owner a way to be notified of a visitor
        or repair/service worker waiting at the gate?

Am I just being a Luddite on this issue, or do I have grounds for
thinking that this solution is not the best way to approach the
problem of remote notification from the gate? The cost for repulling
pairs from the gate to the individual units, and a new intecom system,
is admittedly greater when compared to the "phone" system's initial
start-up costs. But are there hidden costs, and are there other legal
and/or privacy concerns that will come back to haunt this
installation?

As I noted at the beginning, I hope this does not lead to flame wars.
I know I could easily have a second pots line installed in my unit for
my modem/fax. But at the moment I do not have to incur this additional
monthly expense, and would not look favorably to having pay for a
second line if forced to do so. 

I am looking forward to hearing the collective wisdom of the net.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The association is opting for the cheap
way out on this. *Good* front door/apartment intercom systems which 
operate via the telephone use either CO-provided equipment with dedicated
pairs jumpered into your phone line or they use a control box in the
basement of the building (or wherever telco's demarc is for the property.)
I think the former, CO-based system, called Enterphone, and tariffed by 
various telcos was ruled against by Judge Greene with the telcos unable to
sell any further systems and existing subscribers grandfathered. I know
Ameritech does not offer it any longer; all they do is maintain the old
customers of Illinois Bell who have had it for years.  The on-premises
version is called 'Interphone', and was manufactured by GTE/Canada for
quite awhile ... maybe still. Either way, the results are the same.

With E(I)nterphone, the control box (or central office) sends dialtone
to the front gate and a phone there. The front gate dials a three digit
code. The control box (or central office) translates that to a given
*house pair* at the premises. That *house pair* (in the case of a control
box on the premises) or *dedicated pair from the central office* (in 
the case of a CO-based system) always stays with the apartment, regardless
of what actual phone number is in use. Indeed, the resident need not have
phone service at all, just an instrument attached to the pair in his
apartment. 

So the front gate dials a (usually) three digit code. The translation is
done to a pair. The pair is tested for busy, and if it is not in use,
ringing voltage is sent. The ringing cadence identifies the call as sent via
the front gate rather than a 'regular' call. I think it is two short rings
and a pause, then two more short rings. If the pair tests busy then a
unique call-waiting tone is imposed on the line over the existing conversa-
tion. It also is unique so the apartment user can distinquish a central
office call waiting versus a front gate call interupting a 'regular' call.

The apartment dweller answers the phone and is given up to 45 seconds for
a conversation with the gate. This limit can be set by the installer. The
ringing cadence, as mentioned above, allows the apartment dweller to use
the appropriate answer phrase, or to ignore the call entirely without
risking missing a 'real' phone call if desired. If the phone is in use and
the control box (or central office) imposes the special 'front door call
waiting' tone, then the apartment dweller can choose to ignore it or
answer it. If ignored, the gate is automatically disconnected after about
five or six rings. If the apartment dweller chooses to answer, this is
done in the regular way with a switchook flash. The local control box then
puts the central office on hold and connects in the gate call. 

As noted above, there can be up to 45 seconds of conversation. To admit
the gate caller to the premises, the apartment dweller dials 7 on the phone.
To deny admission, dial 9. (This varies by installation also). In either
case, the gate is then disconnected and if a 'regular' call was in 
progress the central office is reconnected. If not, then the phone simply
goes dead, or returns 'regular' dial tone if left off hook a few seconds.
I(E)nterphone cannot be used for apartment-to-apartment calls. If the
apartment dweller chooses to admit the visitor (by dialing 7), the control
box sends appropriate current to the gate to allow the gate or front door
to unlatch momentarily. If the system is CO-based, then the CO sends 
current over a dedicated pair to a relay near the front door which in turn
throws the relay and allows the appropriate current to unlatch the front
door. 

Neither version allows calls from the gate to be 'call forwarded'. This
should be obvious since neither system relies on any specific phone number,
but rather, just a pair of wires from the control unit to the apartment
using the existing house pairs. Likewise, neither version will send calls
to voicemail, since there is no call to be withdrawn after a certain
number of rings. The use of *70 does not affect calls from the gate. In
both the premises and CO-based versions, *70 is overridden by the gate.

In most places, there are at least two pairs in every apartment. At the
time of installation, if you have two phone lines, residents ask to have
the front gate system attached to one or the other. It is not necessary
to reveal your phone number to anyone -- all they use are the pairs which
come there.  If a resident has only one phone line, then often times he
will request that the front door system be attached to the idle pair in
his apartment. He then purchases a cheap ten dollar phone somewhere to
attach on that line in his apartment for door-answering purposes only.

If your phone is disconnected for non-payment (or you are new in the
building and don't have it turned on yet) this does not matter where the
front door is concerned. All you need is an instrument on the pair in
question.  In both versions, it is strictly front gate to apartment.
The apartments cannot call each other, nor can they call the gate.
In high security locations where the gate or front door phone is likely
to be vandalized, special phones with armored handset cables, etc can
be used. One installation in Chicago I am familiar with uses a speaker-
phone at the front door, and a touch tone pad with aluminum buttons to
press. Pressing the first button (always a '1' in their application)
turns on the speakerphone with a 45 second timeout. The next two digits
are translated to the apartment in question. They leave nothing for
the 'guest' at the front door to get his greasy filthy hands on except
buttons to push. No receivers to steal or smash, no phone to rip out,
etc. The speaker itself is mounted inside the wall behind a steel plate.

Tell your association to reconsider what they are doing, and to do it
right. Yes, it costs a bit more, but provides excellent security. Many
buildings in Chicago use the system I have described, along with a television
camera which monitors the gate or front entrance. The apartment dweller
need merely tune on 'channel 3' on television to view the front door
while talking on the phone to the person he is viewing on television.
This is the *only* way to go, in my opinion.    PAT]

All sysops provide an 'editing' function like AOL's.  I have simply NEVER 
heard of a system where an abusive user is tolerated indefinitely.  S/He is 
kicked off the system, after being warned.  What constitutes 'abuse'
is, of course, an editorial decision, and warning, and kicking the
user off is an editorial act.  AOL formalizes it in codified policies
because they are big, but EVERY system on the net does it.

The implication of PAT's point of view, then, is that ALL system
operators will and SHOULD be liable for the CONTENT of the postings of
their users.  If AOL should be liable for libel, then every University
or company that allows access to the various fora on the internet is a
publisher.  Guess what?  Sue them and they'll yank internet access.
That is the only 'editorial' decision they can afford.  And what gain
to whom then?  PAT?

WHY, oh why should kicking off a consistent curser or other sort of
obnoxious jerk bring the resonsibility on you of checking the facts of
every consumer's opinion of the product they received (or failed to)?
What possible societal good is served by this policy?  PAT?

No one seems to sue printing presses that I'm aware, anyway.  The
author, yes, the publisher, yes if it has deep pockets, but the
printing press, I don't hear of it.  Why can't AOL be more like a
printing press in terms of liability.  Suppose I run a printing press,
and refuse to print up a bunch of pornography.  Do I then have to not
only READ, but CHECK THE FACTS in everything else brought in for me to
print?  PAT?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It is a matter of degree. AOL tries very
hard to police their users rather than waiting for sufficient complaints
*from other users* as a reason to deny service. If no one complains at
all, a Guide on AOL will still write up a user for various things. That
is a little more pro-active than I think would be allowed if it came to
a court test. If a system is going to be something more than just a 
hodge-podge of whatever the users happen to write there, then there has
to be some editorial control. As soon as some editorial control gets
underway, you are on the proverbial 'slippery slope' that leads to what
the editor did or should have done to prevent libel, etc. I think in
general though, it is time for BBS sysops to grow up. If you want to
have a genuine e-zine kind of thing, then play by the rules. If all you
want is to have your hobby, that's fine also, but go one way or the
other. I personally think most sysops would opt for some professionalism
in the way their boards are run. I think the electronic online community
has matured to that point in the past decade. In any event, cases like
Prodigy are what keep the courts busy. We have to save some work for
the lawyers and judges don't we?  Should they have to go hungry because
the rest of us behave ourselves so perfectly all the time?  <grin>  PAT]

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: "B" systems are those systems owned and
operated by the local 'wireline telco' of record in the community being

telco from another town. Ameritech is the "B" carrier in Chicago because
it operates the phone company here; it is the "A" carrier in some other
places. Likewise, Southwestern Bell Mobility is the "B" carrier in 
St. Louis where they are also the phone company, but here in Chicago
Southwestern Bell is the "A" carrier, operating under the name Cellular
One. Is that all clear as mud?  Many/most "A" carriers use the franchise
name 'Cellular One' for their activities while the "B" carriers use
whatever name they use.   PAT]

Sex sells.  Because sex sells, it is often used to promote either an
otherwise lackluster product, or a product which has no other value.
It is, therefore, somewhat astonishing to find that careful writing
and a good deal of research have gone into this work.
 
Part one deals with email and mailing lists.  Descriptions are
thorough, and there are often sample messages.  The list includes not
merely "kinky-girls" and the like, but social and political lists
touching on matters of sex and sexuality.  Part two covers Usenet
news, with chapters on related discussion newsgroups, graphics
postings, personals, sex and politics, and anonymizing servers.  IRC
(Internet Rely Chat) and MUDs (Multiple User Domains) are described in
part three.  The final section discusses looking for file archives,
various available FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions lists), and
companies with sex-related products.  There is an appendix which talks
about file archiving, compressing and encoding software and formats.
 
The discussions of general Internet tools are brief, but quite sound.
A list of mail-to-Usenet gateways is the most complete I've ever seen.
(Ironically, it includes the defunct decwrl site, but not the
ubiquitous utexas mailer.)  I'm surprised at a "search strategy" which
uses arcane local commands, but doesn't take advantage of archie.  One
point in regard to scanning files should be made--at least one
prosecution for scanning and making available copyright material from
magazines such as Playboy has been successfully completed, and more
are in the works.

Subject: MCI Purchases Darome Teleconferencing


MCI Communications has purchased Darome Teleconferencing of Chicago for
$32 million. The deal, which was concluded about a week ago, created
one of the world's largest privately held international teleconferencing
companies. 

Darome, which has 12,000 clients worldwide, now gets access to MCI's
extensive customer base. On the flip side, MCI now gets extensive inroads
into the teleconferencing market. Darome was founded in 1969,  the same
year as MCI was making its first major expansion here in Illinois.

The MCI/Darome conferencing unit will operate as a separate entity within
the MCI Business Market group. The agreement still needs stockholder
approval from stockholders of both companies and clearance under the 
federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. 

According to Philip D. Knell, Darome's president and CEO, desktop video
conference units will be quite commonplace within the next three to four
years.

Subject: The PBX Owner's Lament
Date: Mon, 05 Jun 1995 12:31:46


This weekend, the {Arizona Republic} ran an article in the Business
section about how awful it is that business owners in the new Arizona
area code (520) are having trouble receiving calls from their
customers/suppliers.  Never mind that the permissive dialing period
hasn't ended yet (it's scheduled for 7/23), one guy says that he's
already lost 60% of his business.

Of course, the Corporation Commission has already asked US West to
automatically extend the permissive period (right after US West
extended the one in Washington, I believe), but US West said no. Now
they are in negotiations for a non-automatic extension, but US West is
already denying requests for new telephone number blocks, and the
cellular/paging companies are being hurt. They're out of numbers (or
nearly so) and can't get any more until some time after permissive
dialing ends.

Isn't this getting silly? Have any of the new NPAs gone out of permissive 
dialing yet?

On another related note: Recently I was at the local Novell office
downtown, which is located at the AT&T office building. This building
is served by some type of Definity/Audix combo and provides tenant
service to all the non-AT&T tenants, including Novell. I needed to
place a call to a customer that has a number of the form 602-906-xxxx,
a form that's been used here since about two days after it was
allowed. The PBX denied me, obviously it hasn't got the proper
exchange/NPA tables set up. Not even at AT&T.

Subject: "Fax Mailbox" Type Services - How They Work, Which Are Good
Date: 5 Jun 1995 04:08:01 GMT
Organization: Starfleet Command


My roommate and I would like to be able to receive FAXes.  However,
due to various reasons that would take too long to get into, we cannot
have a second phone line in our apartment, and we can't afford a fax
machine, or to have a computer on 24 hours a day.

I've heard of "fax mailbox" type services that will give you a phone
number that people can send FAXes to.  Then you call in at a later
time and pick up any FAXes waiting for you.  It kinda works like an
answering machine or voice mail, but it's for FAX transmissions.

Since I don't know exactly how they work, if anyone does, and can
explain it to me, I would appreciate it very much.  Also, what extra
hardware do we need to have in order to use this service?  Will it
work with FAX modems hooked to computers, or do you NEED a fax
MACHINE?

Lastly, I have no idea who offers these services, and how much they
cost.  Obviously, we'd want to try and shop around for the best deals,
and if it's more expensive than the system we're using now, it will
probably be best to make do with what we have.

If it matters, we live in the Santa Barbara, CA (southern California)
area, and our local telephone provider is GTE.  We use MCI for our
long-distance service.

Please reply by E-MAIL to picard@silcom.com.  Thank you for your help!

I need a reliable (read rock solid) CTI app that will collect data
from callers via the phone's keypad and save that to a file that I can
incorporate into a database I'm designing.

This is my vision: caller dials number and gets message:

"Enter authorization code."

Caller does so and is authenticated.

"Enter daily sales volume"

Caller enters ##### (whatever number) and terminates with pound sign or 
whatever.

Application saves input into flat file for later merge into database.

Any help appreciated.

Subject: Billed Party Preference
Date: 5 Jun 1995 13:36:28 GMT
Organization: Tulane University


Does anyone know what the latest is on 'Billed Party Preference'(BPP)??

A recent FCC Inquiry deals with 'branding' collect calls (reverse
charge) calls via operators/automated-operator-services on BOTH ends
of the call.  The Opr/Opr-Svc. MUST identify itself to the party
placing the call AND to the party receiving (and paying if they
accept) the call.

We all know about the problems of PRIVATE PAYPHONES (euphamistically
called 'COCOTS') and Private Operator services(?), euphamistically
called AOS'.  MOST of us know how to use 10-XXX+ (soon to be
101-XXXX+) access/identifier codes, 950-XXXX and 1-800- access numbers
which are to route the call via the carrier WE as the caller want to
use (and if it is collect/3d.pty., since we probably have a personal
arrangement with the paying party, we know the carrier they would like
us to use) to over-ride the preselected carrier of the private
payphone owner (even the '0' carrier of the Telco payphone, chosen by
the business location owner).

(In an earlier post, I stated that I would like to see ALL local
telcos/inTRA-Lata carriers ALSO have access numbers/codes as above,
preferably a UNIVERSAL/NATIONAL code/access-number for 'the local
exchange carrier' for use on InTRA-LATA calls, since SOMETIMES,
Bell/LocalTelco IS less-expensive than ANY IXC on inTRA-LATA/Local --
THIS would be IDEAL for private payphone and PBX situations where you
cannot get the LEC '0' services)

Billed Party Preference (BPP) is supposed to use 'LIDB' Line-Information-
Data-Bases, something like the 800 Database -- A 'LOOKUP' would be done
on '0' type calls and the call would route over the (primary) carrier
of the BILLED party, rather than the originating-line (calling) party.
The end-user (calling party) CAN, of course, use a 10-XXX+ to
override, or use 950- or 1-800- 'feature-group-B' access for a
DIFFERENT carrier (and of course, the billed party could refuse the
call).  The only catch to this override is that the dialing party
might just dial 0+ at a private payphone (assuming that the
collect/3d.pty's chosen carrier will be the carrier), but the
PAYPHONE'S INTERNAL CHIPS will route the call with its 'dialout' by
doing a 10-XXX+ or 950/1-800 for the ripoff '0' carrier.

BUT I haven't seen anything lately about implementation of LIDB or BPP.  
ANYTHING LATELY???

Subject: Crossed Wires and ANI


If this has been explained previosly I apologize, but curiosity has
gotten the better of me.  I work on a contract to the miliary and in
addition to making all the computers play nice with each other I seem
to be the local telecom guru.  This does not speak well of my talents
but more the lack of talent around me.  In any event I was troubleshooting 
some of our incoming modem lines and caused an odd (to me) situation
to occur.

To explain a little we have 600 pairs coming in from a 5ESS and
several strands of fiber.  A few of these are T1 some 56K but mostly
these are POTS/Centrex lines.  I was using MY-ANI-IS to label the
demarc (cursing my predecessor!) when I slipped up.  I was using a
tone butt set to dial out on each of the lines in a 66 block.  My
count was off and I tied across pins 9 and 10 instead of 10 and 11.
This gave me TIP of one line and RING of another, oblivious I hit the
redial.  The call went out and other than the audio being reduced
nothing seemed odd.  Since the AC and prefix are the same the 301-NXX
sounded like the echo supression was bad.  It wasn't until I got to
the extension number that I got a clue something was wrong.  What I
got was a readback of both numbers simultaneosly!  Yes they were off
by a few milliseconds (accounting for the echo) but if I listened
carfully I could hear both numbers being reported.

A little more information.  These lines can also be connect to AUTOVON
so we have two outdial codes. I was using the commercial carrier for
these calls.  It defaults to Sprint if that makes any difference.
There has also been mention of an ORM (Optical Remote Module?) at our
POP.  So far the facilities telco people only tell me "Nah, can't work
like that". As this is a military intallation I can't experiment with
this as much as I would like.  A few of the questions I have are:

        1) Can this happen in a "normal" configuration?
        2) Is it a security problem for us?
        3) What does the billing system do with this?

I'm sure others in the group will have more questions and hopefully 
answers to this one.

Subject: Inbound Out-of-Home-Area Cellular Calls


Hello,

Could someone please explain the mechanism that allows cell phones to
*receive* calls while they are out of their home area? I recently had
the need to receive a call while out of my area (Central Indiana via
Cellular One) and according to the friendly representative all I
needed to do was dial some access code ONCE to unlock the block from
my phone.

He said that once the block is released, I can receive calls anywhere
in the US and all people have to do is dial my number in Indiana
(317-xxx-yyyy) and the system will locate me in any state I am,
without me doing anything special or my callers calling funny access
numbers.

I did not try this (I was able to place calls but not receive) and the
obvious question is, is the guy right? will the system search thru ALL
cell networks in the US trying to find me, or I need to register
somehow that I'm in the Chicago area so that I can be reached there ...

Any explanation of the above will be appreciated. It *can't* be as
simple as what the guy said.


Thanks,

Subject: Bell Canada Applied For Information Service Trial


The Bell Canada Tariff Notice 5453 back in 15 March 1995 contains the
proposal to test Bell's Local Information Service (LIS). Bell sought
the approval to have this trial from 1 August 1995 to 31 July 1996.
This market trial requires approval from the CRTC if that regulator
has not ruled on this application already.

Instead of the 976 or 900 numbers, there would be new #1xx# format
numbers to dial (such as #123#, including the # signs). These numbers
are intended for access to databases (perhaps voice, perhaps data,
depends on the info provider). Customers could be billed a flat rate
per call.

Those wanting seven-digit numbers for this service can make use of an
option that sets up a 555.xxxx number seven-digit access.

The Tariff Notice states that 30 service providers plan to participate
in this field trial. The numbers will be available throughout Bell
Canada territory except NPA 807 and independent companies (perhaps
also excluding a few exchanges not converted to DMS technology, unless
Bell plans to complete its system-wide switch conversions by the time
the market trial begins).

Bell South and Cox are mentioned as having a similar setup in the U.S.

Info I'd like to share:

I just went through my phone bill, and found that LDDS would save me 
more than 50% off my Sprint long distance bill.  For interstate calls,
LDDS charges $.20 per minute during peak times (8-5) and $.10 otherwise.
Note the peak time of 8-5.  Sprint's peak time ends at 7 pm.  However, the
biggest cost factor for me is the fact that there is no surcharge for 
the use of the LDDS phone card.  Sprint charges $1 per call...and I end
up paying $1 each for a lot of one minute calls (for reaching an answering
machine, generally!)

Info I need:

So what does one get in terms of quality of connections and customer 
service with LDDS?  Sprint is just OK for customer service (on good days!),
but has great quality ... any advice would be appreciated!

Hi all,

A few years ago, my NTI rep gave me a disk from Northern with an NTI
program called Remote Assistant.  This program worked along side
Procomm Plus for Windows, and allowed you to highlight an error
message and via a ProWin macro, copy and paste the message into a
search form that would then interpret the message.  I still have the
program, but it is based on information from release 16, and I am
running release 20.  Does anyone know if NTI still supports this
product, or did they ever?

I just got a flyer in the mail describing my callerid options (though
I've had caller ID for a year or so).  It suggested if I had any
concerns about my privacy options I could call 890-1900 and the
electronic operator would tell me just what restricts I had signed up
for.  Well the electronic operator said I was not in a caller id area!
I then called from line 2 to line 1 just to verify things, and caller id
worked fine.  So it looks like NYNEX's automated caller id information
number is broken.  Hummmm.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: By the way, remember the article last week
about how one can call up and get the balance and payment arrangements, etc
on any phone because of the lack of security? It works that way!  I tried
the 800 number given for NYNEX (even though I am in the Chicago area) and
punched in at random a few 212, 718 and 914 numbers. It cheerfully told me
how much they owed, how much their last payment was, etc. You'd think they
would at least block it from outside their region. It did not even cut me
off after one or two queries, but was willing to sit there and keep talkiung
as long as I punched in numbers at random.  What concerns me is that some
people would make those inquiries in a not-so-random way.   PAT]

First of all, "Slick Tricks" is apparently a series.  The intent of
the series is to provide the "essence" of a given topic.  In other
words, this is supposed to be another beginner's guide based on "the
least you need to know".
 
Secondly, make note of chapter two, and, "The Best Tip in the Book:
Get a Delphi Subscription!"  Ostensibly, Delphi is being promoted
because it was the first of the major commercial online services to
offer a full Internet connection: i.e., ftp, telnet, email and Usenet
news.  (This explains why the World Wide Web only gets peripheral
mention down around page 227 -- Delphi does not support dial-up IP.)
 
Basically, there is a lot of good information here -- buried in a mass
of text, some jokes, and lots and lots and lots of opinions, all
organized (or, in some cases, disorganized) to present the net to you
in such a manner that certain viewpoints are displayed in the most
favorable light.  Even knowing the material and the key words to look
for, I still found reading this book and extracting the answers to be
very difficult.
 
I think it improbable that the biases in the work would exactly match
those of any given reader, nor that the book's agenda would correspond
to the reader's needs.

Subject: Long Distance Rate History Question


Pat,

I would like to know how much was the average LD rate in the USA back in 
early 1900's to 1985? I know right now it is about as low as 11 cents and 
as high as 23 cents per minute. 

Also what is the average basic rate for a local line? Right now, in 
Oakland, Ca (PacBell (: $11.37, Denver, CO (USWest): $18.29, etc. How 
much was it in those time frame I mentioned above?

I'm so interested in telecommunications especially with Area Codes, 
Prefixs, etc.


Thanks for your time.

Michael Adler    Oakland, CA


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: In some possessions which belonged to my
grandmother is a small (4.5" wide by about 6" long) ***handwritten***
telephone bill dated March 1, 1927 on letterhead from the Illinois Bell 
Telephone Company of 212 West Washington Street, Chicago 6, Illinois,
Telephone OFFicial-9411.  The letterhead was entitled "Invoice For Telephone
Subscription" and it stated in a quite attractive style of handwriting that 
the monthly charge for service in advance was one dollar, eighty five
cents. Since I do not know if my grandparents at that time had an extension
phone or non-pub or anything that might have increased the cost of the
monthly service -- and since in those days Bell did not itemize things
on the bill the way they do now -- I cannot tell you what all that
included.  The invoice went on to include the fact that the month before
they had made two Long Lines calls. One, to Whiting, Indiana was billed
thirty cents for two minutes; the other to New York City, New York was 
billed ninety cents for three minutes. 

At the bottom of the bill was printed the phrase 'your account has been
prepared and verified by Bookkeeper ____ (here was written in the number
397) to whom inquiries, reports of errors and requests for adjustments
should be addressed at the offices of the Company.' Then below that the
printed statement, 'Your account is due when tendered. Payment may be
made by post with your name and telephone number clearly printed on your
check, in person by visiting our Business Office, or to your telephone
man, should he be visiting or working at your premises soon, or that of
a neighbor.' ('Telephone man' was simply the name for a repair tech or
installer -- one and the same person -- in those days.)

Another bill from 1943 was on the same kind of stationary, but had been
prepared by typewriter. The monthly charge that month was two dollars.
There were no long distance calls on the bill. A rubber stamp message
on the invoice had a picture of a very firm looking Uncle Sam with his
fingers crossing his lips, and text saying:

                      Loose Lips Sink Ships!
            When our operator calls you to connect your
            long-awaited call to a loved one overseas --
            a husband, or son, or brother perhaps, please 
            do not compromise our Nation's security by asking
            questions your loved ones are not permitted to answer.
            They'd tell you if only they were allowed to do so. And
            when the operator asks you to finish your conversation, 
            please do so promptly so that others may speak to their 
            loved ones as well. Support our men! Together we'll win!  
 
Overall, telephone rates over the years have not increased nearly as much
as inflation would otherwise indicate. My understanding is that telephone
rates in the very early years of this century were quite high by compari-
son to the 1930-50 period when they came down a lot. 

Another peice of literature, apparently inserted with telephone bills in
the 1942-45 era from the telephone company showed a smiling Uncle Sam
and a message saying, "Say brother! Have you got a phone to spare? Since
Western Electric went to war, we just can't keep up with the demand for
instruments to supply to new subscribers. Please help us help your new
neighbors by allowing the telephone man to remove your extension phone
if you have one. That extension phone will be given to another family so
they can have telephone service also. Let's work together in the War
Effort. Together we'll win!" It sounds pretty unbelievable, doesn't it.  PAT]

I just bought a used Codaphone 4250, but when I called the Codaphone
customer support line, I was disappointed to hear that they were no

I bought this machine because it has the ability to flash its
'switchook' and transfer the incoming call (assuming the co/pbx
supports this).

If someone out there could explain how to use this feature, I'd really
appreciate it!  You can either email me at larryr@peri.com or,

I have a problem that I hope someone can help me with.  I live in the
middle of a 5000 acre nature preserve ... (yes it's nice) BUT: I have
no phone (except for the cellular that is way too expensive, especially
when I go online ...), no electricity etc.  (Yes; we have hot running
water and bathrooms ...)

The house itself is nice; and I have 12 volts from a battery bank, and a 
generator that is turned on now and then.

I have a neighbor about two miles away (can't see them; but I know he's 
there...  over a hill and tress...) that will let me install a phone line 
 from the phone company in his garage; and use his electricity to run a 
transmitting device so that I can get a phone ... IF I can find a solution.

I would like a 'full duplex' model ... preferably so I can use my
modem and an answering machine; but will live with a simple radio
phone if one exists ...

Requirements: It needs to ring when a call comes in (buzz, jump up and
down, etc is okay too ...) I need to be able to dial out, and use DTMF
tones for long distance carriers and banks ,etc ...  BONUSES: use a
modem with the system; be able to use call waiting; call forwarding
(provided by MaBell); and use an answering machine at home.  it
doesn't need to be 'ultra secure' as I'm using cellular service now;
and anyone can listen in on that ...


Please respond to:

so let me know. I know at least one other house that would be interested 
in a similar setup.

Subject: ANI vs CALLER ID
Date: 05 Jun 1995 00:27:55 GMT
Organization: 4-T Acres


The other day, I called a company and requested information.  The lady
said "I have your number as [my phone number] an ANI listing".  How
did she do this?  Is there a device that would let me do this to know
who is calling?  How is this different than Caller ID?

Another question about ANI. I called 1-800-MY-ANI-IS with my cell phone 
and it gave a totally different number than what my cell number is.  I
tried to call the number that ANI gave me and it said "You have reached a 
disconnected number."  Why doesn't it give my regular number?  I was
roaming once, and it gave me the number of the phone.


GREG


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: ANI and Caller-ID are quite similar but not
entirely the same. The end result is the same; the called party gets the
phone number of the caller. From residence phones, for all intents and
purposes the information via Caller-ID and/or ANI is one and the same.

When you call an 800 number, you *cannot* withhold your number from the
called party. The use of *67 is overridden by ANI delivery. Sometimes 
ANI is delivered after the fact -- like once a month with the phone bill --
and it can also be delivered in realtime, just like Caller-ID on display
units. Most large companies get it in realtime as well as on their bill
each month. 

Cellular phones seem to always deliver 'out of area' messages to Caller-
ID boxes. Where ANI is concerned, they always seem to deliver the number
of the outgoing trunk line on the cellular carrier's system rather than
the actual cellphone number itself. I don't know why. When I used my cell
phone to call my 800 number, the 800 ANI a month later on the bill showed
a number which when traced through the Ameritech Name and Address service
came back listed to something called the 'IBT Company' at a *suburban*
address (even though the cell phone was a 312 number). Further checking 
into that address showed it was a telco central office building. Dialing
the number got the message that the number was not in service for incoming
calls.  I don't know why they do things the way they do.    PAT]

Subject: Revised Exon Amendment: ACLU Cyber-Liberties Analysis
Date: 05 Jun 1995 16:30:19 -0400
Organization: ACLU National Office


ACLU Cyber-Liberties Analysis: 
Revised Exon Amendment 
May 25, 1995 
 
The American Civil Liberties Union has previously expressed its strong
opposition to the "Communications Decency Act," introduced by Senator
Exon as S. 314 and adopted by the Senate Commerce Committee as an
amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act
of 1995.
 
Yesterday, we obtained a revised version of the Exon Amendment, which was
apparently written by members of Senator Exon's staff in consultation with
representatives of online service providers, the Department of Justice, and
pro-censorship lobbying groups.  The following analysis presents the ACLU's
objections to the revised draft and clarifies the ACLU's continuing concern
that the Exon amendment, in its existing or revised form, violates both
free speech and privacy rights. 
 
I. Interactive Cyberspace Must Not Be Constricted by Old Media Models 
 
The most fundamental flaw of the revised Exon amendment is that it still
wrongly attempts to force the new interactive environment of cyberspace and
online services into the censorship straitjacket foisted on old media.  In
fact, the Exon amendment even uses as its model the most restrictive of the
old media.   
 
This is wrong-headed policy. It is also a violation of the Free Speech and
Privacy guarantees of the Constitution and therefore unconstitutional. 
 
The Exon amendment would make the interactive environment one of the most
censored segments of communications media when logic dictates that
cyberspace, with its emphasis on user-choice and user-control, should make
it the least censored.  At a minimum, the extremely limited rules of
content-regulation for print media, and the safeguards against censorship
for print materials, should be applied to online communications.  The ACLU,
moreover, believes that the characteristics of cyberspace, including the
private and interactive nature of the communication, dictates that
cyberspace should be even more free than print. 
 
We stress that there is no revision of the Exon amendment -- no tinkering
of its censorship provisions -- that eliminates this problem.  The Exon
amendment cannot be "fixed."  It must be rejected. 
 
II.  The Exon Amendment Would Still Restrict Online Communications to Those
Appropriate for Children    
 
Section (d) of the revised Exon amendment would still unconstitutionally
restrict all online content to that which is suitable for children. 
 
Even under existing case law, non-obscene speech that is deemed "indecent"
is protected by the First Amendment.  _Sable Communications v. FCC_, 492
U.S. 115 (1989).  The Government may only regulate indecent speech if it
establishes a compelling governmental interest in the regulation AND
narrowly tailors the restriction to achieve that interest.  _Id._ at 125. 
See also _Pacifica Foundation v. FCC_, 438 U.S. 726 (1978); _Carlin
Communications v. FCC_, 749 F.2d 113 (2d Cir. 1984) (Carlin I); _Carlin
Communications v. FCC_, 787 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 1986) (Carlin II); _Dial
Information Services v. Thornburg_, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991). 
 
Indeed, much of what consenting adults prize about some of their personal
communications could well be deemed by outsiders as "indecent" if addressed
to a child.  
 
The revised draft, like the original Exon amendment, is unconstitutional
because requiring users and content providers to reduce their content to
what is suitable for children is not the least restrictive means for
protecting minors from indecent material.  The "justifications" for
regulation of indecency in broadcasting and telephone audiotext services do
not apply to interactive communications, in which users -- including parents
 -- have much more control over the content of the messages they receive.  We
are also prepared to argue that the "justifications" asserted for
censorship in any of the old media, including print, do not apply to
cyberspace. 
 
III. Some Specific Problems in the Revised Exon Draft 
 
Again, the ACLU strongly believes that the anti-cyberliberty Exon amendment
cannot be "fixed."  It needs to be defeated.  So, even if all of these
specific problems were solved, the Exon amendment would still be a terrible
idea.  Still, it may be useful to consider briefly some of the specific
problems in the revised Exon draft. 
 
     *Revised section (d) outlaws the online transmission of obscene
materials without defining "obscenity."  Using the test for obscenity
articulated in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 1 (1973), the federal
government has chosen to stage prosecutions of online obscenity cases in
conservative jurisdictions in order to take advantage of more restrictive
"community standards."  See Thomas v. United States, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit, No. 94-6648 and No. 94-6649.  This trend poses a
severe threat that online users and providers will be forced to reduce
content to that which would be acceptable under the "community standards"
of the most conservative jurisdiction.  The ACLU has filed an amicus brief
in the Thomas case strongly opposing the government's misuse of the
censorship laws.   
 
     *Revised sections (d) and (e) extend liability for transmission of
obscene or indecent communications to non-commercial in addition to
commercial providers.  This change would render the revised draft more
restrictive of free speech than the original Exon amendment. 
 
     *While revised section (f) provides some defenses for online service
providers, these defenses place smaller system operators at risk because
they cannot afford to assert the defenses in court.  Moreover, the defenses
are incomplete and many larger service providers would likely find
themselves in jeopardy at the hands of prosecutors motivated by the
political advantages of currying favor with certain pro-censorship groups. 
 
     *Revised section (f)(2) fails to protect providers who cede editorial
control to an entity "which the defendant knows or had reason to know
intends to engage in conduct that is likely to violate this section."  This
could pose serious problems for Internet providers that may have "reason to
know" that certain sites are likely to contain communications deemed to be
obscene or indecent. 
 
     *Revised section (f)(3) gives the Federal Communications Commission
the power to issue regulations regarding methods in which providers may
restrict access in order to avoid liability. Giving federal regulators the
authority to determine the rules for distributing online content will
radically affect the freedom of cyberspace and will have a severe direct
effect and an equally severe chilling effect on online 
speech. 
 
     *Revised section (f)(4) could still make it impossible for users or
content providers to remedy a violation of rights by an online service
provider if the service claimed it was attempting to comply with the Exon
amendment. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The revised Exon draft continues to subject an industry that has blossomed
without government control to an unprecedented amount of interference and
intrusion over content.  It gravely threatens the free flow of information
and the diversity of content transmitted over online networks. 
 
To achieve the liberating potential of the information superhighway,
Congress must ensure that interactive technologies enhance rather than
stifle democratic values.   
 
The American Civil Liberties Union therefore opposes the Exon amendment,
both in its original form and as revised.

Subject: EMI Issues With GSM


With the deployment of PCS systems about to begin in the United States and
Pacific Bell, BellSouth, and APC announcing the use of a European digital
technology called GSM, I've read the following articles from Ericsson, text
books and two issues of {PC Week} magazine which discuss an unintended side
effect from GSM called EMI (electro-magnetic interference).

These problems appear to have only become known after GSM systems were
deployed in Europe and portable handsets were in wide use. I wonder what
problems we'll see in the USA with GSM systems?


Nathan Meehan   z61535@uprc.com

The following is a quote from a new Artech House book entitled, "An
Introduction to GSM" by Siegmund H. Redl, Matthias K. Weber and Malcom W.
Oliphant.

Although the TDMA structure gives the system more capacity, there is a
price to pay.  If a mobile station transmits a burst every 4.615 ms, then
the underlying frequency is 216.6 Hz (=1/4.615 ms), which is within the
audible range.  If, for example, a GSM mobile is operated close to a home
stereo system, this frequency can be heard in the speakers.  More serious
is the impact on electronic devices such as hearing aids, cardiac
pacemakers, or automobiles electronics.  Due to the relativity high power
transmitted in the GSM mobile bursts, they can have significant influence.
Some car manufactures already suggest that a GSM mobile should only be used
with an external antenna, because if used inside, the mobile phone may
block or trigger the air bag or other important systems.  Sorting out and
clearing the risks and nuisances caused by GSM phones adds to the cost of
designing and manufacturing them.

Subject: Cellular disturbances

I have one to add to the recent article about cellular phones being banned
from hospitals.

A week ago, one of my fellow sysops had to reboot one of our SUN
servers.  He was installing some software on one server when his
cellular phone rang and the console terminal (a VT220-clone) of
another server started "hiccupping" badly. After he power-cycled it,
the server had halted and wouldn't start without a full reboot. As he
was sitting there staring at the row of consoles, his cellular phone
rang (again) and another terminal crashed!  This time it was
sufficient to "c"ontinue the server so there was only a halt of a few
seconds, but the implication is clear.  We carry those cellular phones
to be available quickly in case a server goes down.  Instead, the
phone was the cause of a crash.  The new (European) digital "GSM"
cellular standard produces lots of interference as can be heard on any
radio or even HiFi amplifier within a few feet of a GSM phone in
operation. An apparently "idle" phone next to ny critical electronic
equipment is a time-bomb waiting to go off since an incoming call to
it automatically triggers bursts of transmissions as the phone
acknowledges the call. This means that banning the use of them may not
be enough - people don't tend to think of just carrying a phone as
"using" it.  They must be turned OFF.

As an aside, the previous (analog) cellular standards did not cause
nearly as much interference despite operating in the same 900 MHz
band.  At the worst, they might "blank out" radio receivers
momentarily but we never observed them interfering with digital
equipment. Now, the European Union is pushing GSM as its sole cellular
standard and is trying to force operators to phase out analog systems
to provide more channels for digital.  I think we've only seen the tip
of this iceberg yet ...

Telcos: don't repeat European GSM woes

     PC Week v12, n18 (May 8, 1995):55.

     COPYRIGHT Ziff-Davis Publishing Company 1995

     Europe's personal cellular systems use a signaling and modulation
scheme called GSM. They are technologically advanced, but for one small
problem: They can't be used by hearing-aid wearers. If hearing-aid wearers
come within several feet of a GSM phone they hear a loud buzzing. If they
get closer, the buzz becomes deafening, drowning out even the sound of
their own voices.

     The problem is well-known in Europe, having been reported on the BBC
and other media. With billions of dollars' worth of infrastructure in
place, however, it's too late to change the technology. Modifying the
hearing aids isn't a viable solution, either. With the emphasis on size,
weight, and battery life, there's virtually no hope for improving the
installed base. With new hearing aids the problem can be reduced, but not
eliminated.

     Tragically, it didn't have to be a problem at all. GSM is based on a
TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) scheme that causes the cellular phone
to send out a pulse of radio-frequency energy 217 times per second. That's
what hearing-aid wearers hear. If the system had been built with another
technology, such as CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), or at non-udible
frequencies or lower power levels, the interference would be eliminated or
greatly reduced.

     The FCC has held its personal communications services license
auctions, and U.S. telcos and wireless companies are selecting their
technologies right now. The builders of European base-station equipment,
giants such as Alcatel and Ericsson, would like to sell their GSM
equipment here, too.

     GSM MoU, the oversight group for GSM vendors, has written to FCC
Chairman Reed Hundt to address the concerns: "Some of the research
suggests that a small percentage of all hearing-impaired persons use old,
inferior-quality hearing aids and therefore may be unable to use high-
power digital wireless telephones, whether they be CDMA, GSM, or AMPs-D."
The letter suggests that hearing aids can be upgraded or replaced, but
doesn't address the attendant cost issues.

     Given what we know about the potential effect of GSM on U.S. hearing-
aid wearers, it's unconscionable that anyone would pursue this option. Yet
BellSouth and Pacific Bell have decided to deploy GSM. I also think it's
inconceivable that the FCC would let each vendor choose a different
standard, yet this appears to be the case.

     GSM appears to have other problems. The power level, combined with
the fast rise time of its pulses, has been reported to cause problems with
other electronic equipment. Sweden bans the phones from its hospitals
because they reportedly interfere with pacemakers and can cause electric
wheelchairs to behave erratically.

     GSM may be a poor choice for mobile computing, too. I wonder about
the potential for confusing the sensitive innards of laptop PCs. I wonder,
too, if there's any chance of interference with emergency communications
equipment used by public-safety officials.

     Why is this important? The technology decisions for the PCS
infrastructure are being made now and are irrevocable once the building
begins. If you're not concerned about the plight of the hearing-impaired,
look at your own situation with enlightened self-interest. If you believe
that GSM is not the right choice, let the FCC know at 1919 M St. NW, Room
814, Washington, D.C. 20554.

TDMA phones a bad choice for U.S.

     PC Week v12, n20 (May 23, 1995)

     COPYRIGHT Ziff-Davis Publishing Company 1995

I've seen and heard enough to be convinced. Cellular phones based on
time-division multiplexing are bad electronic citizens. I wrote about the
deficiencies of Europe's GSM standard on May 8, specifically about
interference with hearing aids. The problem is acute, but not limited to
hearing aids. Some common consumer electronics devices are also subject to
interference.

  I've gone into the lab with representative in-ear and behind-the-ear
hearing aids. My tests were brief, but telling. In-ear devices typically
amplify sound only and are aimed at people with moderate hearing losses,
whereas behind-the-ear devices are larger, with more powerful amplification.
Most have a switchable telecoil, which couples magnetically to telephone
handsets so that the hearing-impaired can use telephones.

  I tested the hearing aids with a conventional analog cellular phone,
900MHz and 1,800MHz GSM phones, a U.S.-standard digital phone, and a
prototype phone that uses CDMA, a low-power, spread-spectrum technology.

  The 900MHz GSM phone was the worst offender, causing a raucous buzz in
both hearing aids. With the telecoil on, you could hear the GSM phones'
217Hz buzz from the behind-the-ear aid across the room. The analog cellular
phone caused no interference.

  The U.S.-standard digital phone, which uses a TDMA technique known as NA-
TDMA or D-AMPs, caused a strong 50Hz buzz in both hearing aids when brought
within a couple of feet of the phone. The telecoil could pick up the buzz
from at least 6 feet away. The CDMA phone had no discernible effect on
either aid. With the telecoil on, the aid got nothing from the phone's
antenna but picked up some hash from the internal microprocessor.

  We overrode base-station controls in order to test the phones at various
power levels. The interference diminished at lower power but never
disappeared. It was impossible to use a hearing aid with any of the TDMA
phones at any power level.

  I also tested a variety of laptop computers and a camcorder with the
phones. Standard notebook and subnotebook machines appear impervious, but a
multimedia notebook with a speaker picked up the TDMA phones' 217Hz and 50Hz
mating cries. The CDMA phone and analog phone caused no interference.

  The camcorder, a generation-old, top-of-the-line Sony, turned out to be
very sensitive to the TDMA emissions. Just being in the same room with
either of the GSM phones was enough to utterly swamp the audio circuitry.

  The phones interfered with the video circuitry as well, causing horizontal
bars and tearing of the picture. The 900MHz phone was again the worst
offender, causing almost the entire picture to blank out. The U.S. digital
phone also messed up the picture and its 50Hz growl could be heard.

  The analog phone caused no degradation of the picture, but the camcorder's
audio picked up some of the microprocessor hash from its keyboard. The CDMA
phone caused no discernible interference.

  GSM officials have told FCC Director Reed Hundt that all portable phones,
including CDMA, will cause interference, but that's not what my tests
showed. GSM is a remarkable achievement of standards and technology. But
it's not the best technology anymore. GSM is attractive to some U.S.
providers, but we deserve better.

Subject: CWA Board Approves Strike Authorization at AT&T


Here is a press release from the Communications Workers of America.
I downloaded the press release from the U.S. Newswire BBS in Maryland
at (410) 363-0834.
I do not work for or belong to the CWA.

 CWA Board Approves Strike Authorization at AT&T; Decision Will be
up to President Morton Bahr

 Contact: Jeffery Miller of the Communications Workers of America,
          202-434-1163

   WASHINGTON, June 5 -- President Morton Bahr of the Communications
Workers of America today asked and received authorization from CWA's
executive board to call a strike by the union's 90,000 members at
AT&T.

   Bahr said he will assess the need for possible strike action after
contract negotiations resume tomorrow.  "It will take substantial
progress on some key issues before any settlement is possible," he
stated.

   CWA members at AT&T already have given strike approval to union
leaders by a vote of more than 95 percent, and today's action allows
Bahr to call for a walkout at any time.

   The current union contract between AT&T, CWA and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers expired on May 27, but the contract
has been extended while day and night bargaining sessions have taken
place ever since.

   However, over this past weekend, "progress was minimal at best,"
said CWA's chief negotiator James Irvine.  "We're still so far apart
on wages and pensions that it looks like AT&T wants to test the
resolve and determination of our members to win a fair settlement."

   The talks were recessed at 5 p.m. Sunday and the parties expect to
get back together tomorrow morning.

   Irvine said other unresolved issues include company subcontracting
of work, transfer rights to non-union job areas at AT&T, union
organizing rights at subsidiaries and retiree health care.

   "AT&T has been investing tens of billions of dollars in new
business enterprises, but they refuse to invest in the employees who
created the corporation's vast wealth," Irvine stated, noting that
AT&T earned a record $4.7 billion net profit in 1994.

   They're nickel and diming active workers and even proposing to
pick the pockets of retired employees on fixed incomes," he said.

Had an unusual "crosstalk" incident happen last night (Sunday 6-4,
around 10:30PM) When calling a friend.  I'm at 201-261-xxxx, friend is
at 212-316-xxxx, AT&T long distance company.  Called friend, his mom
answers, says "Dave's not home now, ..." and we terminate the
conversation and she hangs up first, THEN, I suddenly hear, about at
least 3dB higher, one side of some other random phone conversation
(i.e., I hear only one of the two (supposed) parties).  This lasts for
about a minute, then it suddenly cuts out (they didn't end their
conversation, maybe something in the phone system noticed this error
and cleared it?).

Any idea what might have caused this?   I'm sure nothing in my home
(plane ordinary telephone service without any bells-and-whissles,
old Ma Bell touch-tone and rotary phones) could cause this.  And the
computer with internal Zoom modem was turned off.

I'll give you the punchline up front: after reading megabytes of archives,
I called 'my' Unitel this morning, and they say they have NO CONNECTION to

that I read about in these archives.)

So now I know a whole lot more about the Canadian long distance market from

Anybody know anything about Unitel of 1060 Main St, PO Box 4367, River Edge

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I keep hearing that Guam, etc are supposed 
to be changed -- technically at least -- from being 'international' in
the sense of 011 to reach them to being part of country code 1, meaning they 
would be dialable like any other area code. I just now tried 1-670-xxx-xxxx
and 1-671-xxx-xxxx. Neither would complete. Of course I know they will
complete with 011 instead, so I did not try them that way. It would be
helpful to find out *where* the literature you were seeing had been edited
and published. I'll bet it was published in NMI, which could account for the
way the number appeared in print, with the writer of the advertisement
thinking to himself 'of course we don't use 011 when calling among ourselves.'
It would be the same kind of thinking which prompts USA companies to advertise
in publications in the UK for example, using only a non-dialable 800 number
as their contact, or possibly to use an area code and number without the
leading '1' as our country code. That being said, I still have heard that
Guam, NMI, Saipan, etc are supposed to 'soon' have their country codes
changes to USA area codes. And don't forget 808: formerly just Hawaii, it
now takes in Midway Island in the South Pacific as well.    PAT]

Oh wonderful.  Rupert Murdoch would own most of the broadcast spectrum, 
and public tv and radio would probably disappear.  Along with most
independent tv and radio stations.

OK, DOJ would do the antitrust review, but who does the gepgraphic and
indterference boundaries?  Remember, the FCC is long gone.  I guess we
duke it out in the courts?  Like they aren't clogged already.

So I guess if one of my ridge-runner neighbors decides that he needs a 
10 kw booster for his CB, I have to get a lawyer and sue him?  Or should
I just put up with the plumbing picking up his signal.

Sorry if I sould overly sarcastic.  I get annoyed with the FCC at times.
But this is throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  Let's treat the 
patient and get him better, not sumarily execute him.

Perhaps I don't understand what this means.  All rules and regulations
will be rescinded, and the DOJ will enforce these non-existent rules
by confiscating devices?  Aside from the semantic questions in this
logic, won't the DOJ have to create a special commission which
includes technical specialists and standards definition specialists to
accomplish this mission?  Perhaps it will.  Let's think up a name for
this body...  I know, let's call it the Federal Communications
Commission!

The more things change ...

This is wonderful, especially the last part.  You say the DoJ will
take care of the violators, but the public won't be able to report
anyone?  What would I do if a radio station a block away from my house
upped their power to a jillion watts (by way of the elimination of
regs and restrictions on use policy (below)) and was received by my
radio no matter where the radio is tuned.  (..or if it was received in
my plumbing, for that matter...)  I can't complain about it?  More
importantly, what happens like when a cable operator starts leaking
their signal into the aircraft band endangering lives of air
passengers?  The DoJ is just going to some how know about it without
receiving complaints about it from the public?

It seems the whole idea of "answering of general inquiries from the public 
discontinued" seems contratry to the whole basis of "government by the 
people" that the US' government it built on!

What exactly is the difference between a "deed" and a "license".  Does
taking away the FCC's licensing ability and giving some other
government body "deeding" ability change anything?  The FCC is
actually quite efficent these days in granting licenses. I don't see
why you need to take that funtion away from them (or not give them
"deeding" authority ...)

What do you do about Part 15 (unlicensed) and Part 97 (Amateur Radio)
allocations?  Do these bands become a free-for-all?  Will I have to
start bidding against my neighbors to get frequencies for my cordless
phone?  Will I have to give up my Ham Radio hobby since hams won't be
able to compete against big business who want our spectrum?  (We've
already lost spectrum to big business -- opening things up this way
would certainly put an end to Ham Radio above 30 MHz.)

Do local and state government get to keep their allocations?  Or will
my local police and fire deptartments have to end up buying their
spectrum from Motorola/General Electric/Johnson?

It sounds like big-business would win this hands down every time.
Antitrust may keep on big company from stepping on the little guy, but
industries with lots of money (can you say "telecom") will be able to
get whatever spectrum they want in order to resell it to the general
public.

This proposal doesn't address how to deal with International Agreements
(which are mainly concerned with shortwave operation under 30 MHz).  What
do we do about that.

I'm also interested in the non-wireless ascpects of this proposal.  How are
wireline carriers going to be regulated if the FCC is eliminated?

Frankly, I think this whole proposal is half-baked and not thought out
at all. (Actually it sounds like its written by someone who has a
really big axe to grind with the FCC.)  I don't think the idea of
renovating the FCC is totally bad but I think this proposal has a long
way to go before it will be serious.  If you can prove me wrong and
show me the whole proposal, that would be great!  (Forgive me PAT, but
I think you've posted one huge piece of flame-bait.)

Here's a thought ... at least the HDTV vendors will now have a completely

        What your friend told you is correct.  Residences, for the
most part are correct in the NYNEX E911 database maintained in
Syracuse, NY.  On the other hand, any large business is bound to be
screwed up.  This is a big problem here.  We have General Electric at
several locations, with 12 or 15 thousand employees, most of them with
phones.  We also have many other plants and campuses with outdated
phone equipment that returns all sorts of garbage in the ALI E911
database.  Another problem we recently came accross, which I hope is
specific to NYNEX (wouldnt surprise me) is that anywhere you have more
than one payphones owned on a single account (GE, or some of the
hospitals here are good examples), the ALI will never be correct.  Any
time a service change is performed on ONE of the phones, the ALI
information (for my purposes the address and Emergency Service Zone
numer) for ALL of the phones on that account are mass updated.  This
is just plain wrong.  Nobody in NYNEX has offered us a satisfactory
explination as to why this happens, or how to stop it, but if it is a
big problem in a small town like Schenectady, it must be a real pain
elsewhere.  Is this a problem elsewhere?  If so, have any of you dealt
with it?  (turning off the ALI screen, as NYNEX suggests, is not
dealing with it).  Once again, thanks for any help.  From my original
posting, I received some very useful suggestions.

The problem here is that the CRTC has allowed Bell Canada to make tone
dialing mandatory for all service changes.  If you move, change
numbers, add a new line, whatever, the new service *must be* tone
dial. The subscriber has no choice.

The problem here is that Bell charges *extra* for tone dialing, not
less.  Yep, there's a surcharge on tone dial lines, even though, in
theory, it costs them less to provide.

A picture of the 'golden' statue appeared on an AT&T publication on 
telecomm.history about 10 years ago, 'Events in Telecommunications 
History'.  This book originally was published probably in the late 1950's 
as 'Events in Telephone History' and I think that there are still recent 
editions/revisions (like a 1993 edition);

AT&T still used the statue logo in the 'masthead'/table of contents of 
"Bell Telephone Magazine" in the early 1960's issues.

As for the 'circle' I think that had an older more realisitc looking Bell 
with the words Bell System, each word on different line ('Bell' over 
'System'), with an outer circle - the inscription between the concentric 
circles - American Telephone & Telegraph Company written clockwise on the 
top half and 'And Associated Companies' written counterclockwise along 
the bottom half.  These inscriptions were discontinued around 1964.  The 
present Bell logo came into use around 1969.

In the 30's and earlier, the Bell in the circles, still more realistic, 
was more rounded than the 1950's/60's.  In the teens' and probably 
earlier, the words 'Bell System' did not appear inside the Bell, but 
'Local and Long Distance Telephone' - Bell and AT&T inscriptions usually 
appeard near the 'Bell'.

I'm writing from memory (Not that I was around back then -- I'm only
34 -- but I've seen these logos many times over in my reading and
research), but someone else who has these logos in front of them might
give a better description.

I saw that statue some years ago in the lobby of the then-new AT&T
Corporate Headquarters building at 550 Madison Avenue in Midtown
Manhattan, New York City.  This is the building designed by Phillip
Johnson, and is distinct on the New York City skyline with its
Chippendale roofline.  The statue was moved to this building from
the former AT&T HQ in downtown Manhattan.

With all of the corporate down-sizing going on, I have heard that
AT&T no-longer requires all of the space available in the 550
Madison building, and has has sold (or wants to sell) the building.
If this happens, and if AT&T moves out, the statue is likely to be
moved again.  (I wonder if we'll see it one day at the AT&T
Communications headquarters building, a couple of miles from here,
in Basking Ridge, NJ.)

Well Eric, not yet.  Bandwidth (1.9 GHz range) was only allocated in
the states a few weeks ago.  The protocol to be used has not yet been
determined; however, Canada's NorTel had developed the CT2+ protocol
(& turned down a CT3 protocol from Ericson) about two years ago.
Residential product has not been made available for sale yet, but
private (campus, institutional and corporate) systems have been
available & being sold since then.  The protocol up here includes
handoff between multiple cell sites while in motion (at walking
speeds) with the same quality of signal you enjoy.  The only
difference is that we had allocated the mid-900's MHz bandwidth for
the transmission, and that our regulatory body - the CRTC, has not yet
allocated bandwidth for the public networks (although it is strongly
expected that we will follow the Yanks on Frequency, and NorTel is
already testing 1.9 GHz transceiver elements to work on thier existing
platform).

We do things a bit differently up here but the technology has been
designed to ultimately integrate a portable into all functionality of
a PBX or Centrex service, a future public network (like your
zone-phones) and a personal transceiver for your home.

The ultimate concept here is to create an environment where a single
portable phone can be used at the home, in the public network, or even
at your office (through your PBX, Key System or Centrex).

Well it can be done, and actually I too am a sales critter.  There are a
few methods:

1.      Upgrade your Option 61 software (if not current) to accomodate the
        most recent version (9) of Meridian Mail (voice mail platform). 
        The release 9 has an inherent fax on demand capability using the
        processor as a server and its associated HD to spool.  You can
        also tack voice forms onto this voice mail platform.  The
        proprietary voice card of Meridian Mail performs the interactive 
        voice prompting for the document to fax back.

2.      You can run some of the NorTel IVR products through your switch 
        and integrate totally, as well as offer a platform from which you
        can automate many other inbound voice transactions.

3.      You can run either a fax on demand box or IVR system off of an anologue
        line connected to your PBX.  This doesn't integrate very
        completely though.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The following, although an openly 
commercial message, was of interest to me since it seems that now
the rest of the world is going to begin copying AT&T's concept of
500 service. If any of our UK readers decide to try this, a followup

       <<FleXtel>> : Telephone numbers for life (UK)

STOP PRESS: 7th June 1995: FleXtel launch new '07' numbers
            in the United Kingdom.     


FleXtel Personal Telephone Numbers are the unique, cost effective,
'follow-me' telephone service for your business or personal life with
'free call diversion'.

Take complete control of your incoming telephone calls .

Just one number will reach you at any normal telephone in the United
Kingdom but there are no call diversion charges to pay whatsoever!!

FleXtel service provides a network independent telephone number -- your
new 'telephone number for life'.

FleXtel is not yet another telephone operator. It is a completely new
kind of value-added service which complements the service from your
existing phone company.

You could reduce costs and have the freedom to choose the best deals
available, but all the time being sure of keeping the same telephone
number no matter where you may move within the United Kingdom . (N.B.
Your FleXtel number works in **parallel** with your existing phone
service, so you can start using FleXtel without fear of losing any
calls due to a number change.)

FleXtel not only provides telephone numbers for life, but is also a
genuine low cost alternative to cellular phones, delivering superior
call quality, no coverage problems, and no additional call charge
bills for diverted calls.

Using FleXtel, with a single 'telephone number-for-life', you can
change the destination of your calls 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
You are not restricted to doing this from a particular telephone line,
and in fact you can control your FleXtel routing from just about any
telephone in the world (even pulse dialling phones). You simply call
the special re-routing number, enter your FleXtel number and PersonaI
ID Number using either the phone keypad or a pocket tone dialler, and
within just a couple of minutes your calls will start to arrive at the
new destination you have chosen.

Imagine having a single telephone number that directly connects
inbound calls to you wherever in the country you are, whenever you
choose. That number can indeed become your personal 'number for life'
if you so wish!

FleXtel eliminates any need to give out private home or unlisted
numbers. Yet, by routing your FleXtel number/s to your private numbers
you still can receive calls when you want to! And when you do not wish
to be disturbed, simply re-program your FleXtel number to deliver
those calls to your office, secretary, answering machine or other
service.

Only you will be able to change the routing on your FleXtel numbers,
since access to the special re-routing line is protected by a PIN code
of between four and six digits (chosen by you) which you keep secret,
just like a bank card PIN number.

And of course only you will know the actual destination telephone
numbers. Unless you choose otherwise, all your callers will ever need
to know will be your FleXtel number.

As you can see, it's all about choice. Putting you in control of your
incoming calls. Furthermore, for a small additional charge, you can
even choose your own number from within the available number range.
Just like a personalised car registration number! Pick an easy to
remember number or one which uses the letters on new phone dials to
spell a word, like our 0956 700-TEL number (Ask us about Personal
Selection, Silver, Gold , and Platinum numbers.)

First we give you a FleXtel number pre-programmed to the line of your
choice. Thereafter, using FleXtel, your callers will be calling you
(or your organisation), not where you are.

Deep in the telephone system, high-speed digital exchanges translate
your FleXtel number to the current destination line number and
redirect your calls to your actual location, all in the blink of an
eye. No recorded announcements and no delays. It really is that fast!
Your PIN code enables you to re-route FleXtel calls to any wireline
telephone in the UK. and a change of routing takes only a couple of
minutes!

In traditional call-diversion, your callers pay for a call to your
number, and you then pay for another call (from that number to your
actual location). Between you, you and your caller can pay up to twice
the cost of a normal call that way. With FleXtel it's completely
different. You pay NO CALL CHARGES for the redirection. By the use of
Intelligent Network technology, redirection happens at a very early
stage in the call, so effectively you get free call diversion . All
you have to pay is your of two pounds a month, so you are sure there
will never be any surprises on your phone bill! (Note: FleXtel is an
incoming calls facility; outbound calls are made via your usual phone
company (e.g. BT, Mercury or whoever).

As you might expect from a high quality service, FleXtel is fully
compatible with all normal voice, fax and data calls. Such calls can
be routed to any fixed telephone anywhere in the UK no matter which
telephone company (BT, Mercury, cable) provides the actual line.

Organisations do re-locate, often from one end of the country to
another. The beauty of FleXtel numbers is that if this does happen,
you can take your number with you, no matter what the area code of the
new location is!.  Calls will start to arrive at your new location
within a couple of minutes, just as soon as you instruct the automatic
FleXtel system where to deliver your calls.

As you probably know, most UK telephone numbers changed completely on
16th April 1995. But FleXtel subscribers' numbers did not change. So
you can see how the unique FleXtel service protects your organisation
against the ill-effects of involuntary number changes.

Ex-directory? Or do you want your FleXtel number listed?  It's your
choice! If you wish, you get a free entry in the BT telephone
directory of your choice, and a free entry in the Yellow Pages and
Thomson Local directories as well!. (You choose whether or not your
FleXtel listing replaces or is in addition to any existing directory
entries.)

Or you can be completely ex-directory, if you prefer.  Again, the
choice is yours.

The possibilities are endless, but here are a few of the
applications already benefitting from FleXtel:
    Self-employed people and small businesses.
    Out-of-hours 'hotlines' .
    Answering and messaging services.
    International business people who need a UK number.
    (Note: FleXtel service now includes Jersey (+44 1534),
           Guernsey, Alderney and Sark (+44 1481)
    Teleworkers
    Clubs, associations and the voluntary sector.

In addition to all UK fixed (01) telephone numbers, your FleXtel
number can also route your calls to pagers, to BT VoiceBank, Mercury
one2one phones as well as Orange LocalNumber mobile telephones. Of
course you can also route calls to all direct dialled Freephone
(0800/0500) and local call rate numbers (0345/0645).

FleXtel is so powerful that it can even route calls to other
operators' personal telephone numbers (e.g. the 0374 CallMe service!)

And for all this, FleXtel still makes no charge at all for diverting
the call to its destination.

(Note: Calls to your FleXtel number cannot be routed to Vodafone or
Cellnet, to Premium Rate numbers, or numbers outside the British
Isles; as calls to these numbers can cost around two to three times as
much as the cost for calling FleXtel numbers.

Remember, with FleXtel you NEVER pay for incoming calls!

Your callers will appreciate the service, as contacting you will
become that much easier; since there will be just one number to
remember no matter where you choose to take your calls. (For a small
additional fee, you can customise the number to suit your needs!).

People who call your FleXtel number pay the new low Personal
Communications Rate call charge. (On 6.6.1995 this was typically 7p
per minute at cheap rate and between 12p to 13p per minute at daytime
rate).

YOU pay no call charges at all for the added convenience of being able
to receive your calls whereever you are in the country!

FleXtel Classic (09567 number) rental is an amazingly low GBP 2 per
month, paid annually in advance. That's right, just TWO POUNDS PER
MONTH! Connection is GBP 120 (a once-only charge payable at the time
your number is allocated); but if you quote 'TELECOM Digest' at the
time you make your order with us, you may claim a credit against
Personal Selection Fees.

FleXtel Business (07 number) rental is GBP 4 per month (paid annually
in advance). Connection is GBP 99.00 and personal selection is only
12.00/year.

FleXtel Personal (07 number) rental is 3 per month (paid annually in
advance). Connection is 149.00 and includes free Personal Selection.

And don't forget that all these charges include unlimited diversion of
your calls within the UK. There are no call charges to pay whatsoever!
(VAT will be added to all charges, except for non-UK customers who
have a valid EU tax ID number.)

Make 1995 the last time you ever change your phone number!

Still not convinced? We offer a seven-day trial, completely free of
charge. During the trial period we issue you with a new FleXtel
personal telephone number and PIN which will be yours to use as you
wish. At the end of the trial, if you wish to continue using the
FleXtel service, you can either keep your trial number as your new
FleXtel 'number for life' or, if you prefer, we will issue you with a
brand new number, personalised to your wishes.

So you can have a whole week to discover the benefits of FleXtel, with
no connection charge, no rental charge and of course, as always, no
incoming call charges. What can you lose?

Call now on 0956 700 835 or on 0701 0700 835 for your free trial
number!

FleXtel has proved very popular with an increasing number of
customers. As a result of feedback received, and as a result of the
availability of the new numbering ranges, FleXtel is now pleased to
announce the launch (on 7th June 1995) of two new personal numbering
services using the '07' prefix (specially allocated by Oftel for the
purpose).

When the revolutionary FleXtel service was launched 18 months ago,
there was a maximum limit of 100,000 possible customers who could have
personal numbers.Since PhONEday, and with the addition of our two new
tariffs (FleXtel Business & FleXtel Personal) now everyone can have
their own personal telephone number.

We are committed to improving and enhancing services while continuing
to maintain the flexible, value for money service enjoyed by our
existing customers so you can be sure that FleXtel 'Classic' will
continue to provide flexible personal telephone numbers for life in
tandem with our new services.

The first customer for an '07' personal number was the famous racing
driver, Stirling Moss (whose racing number, -incidentally, was the
'7'.)

TELEBIT AND SPRINT TEAM UP FOR HIGH-SPEED GLOBAL DATA NETWORKS

Telebit V.34 Modems To Help Sprint Provide Electronic Commerce
throughout 70 Countries across Six Continents for Microsoft and Other
Corporate Clients

CHELMSFORD, Mass. and RESTON, Virg. -- May 22, 1995 -- Telebit
Corporation (NASDAQ:TBIT) and Sprint (NYSE:FON) today announced a
business agreement expansion whereby Telebit will provide high-speed
modems and network management software for international on-line
networks Sprint is developing for corporate clients, including
Microsoft Corp.  Under the agreement, Telebit will supply Telebit(r)
FastBlazer(tm) 8840 modems to Sprint for use in data networks
servicing 70 countries across six continents over which products from
Microsoft and other corporations will be marketed and supported.

This agreement extends a five-year business relationship between the
two companies under which Telebit supplies its remote network access
system products -- high-speed modems, dial-up routers and network
management software -- to Sprint for international and domestic data
services.

"A data network of this scope calls for superior technology and high
reliability in order to successfully manage massive amounts of data
across international sites," said Susan Williams, vice president of
international network solutions at Sprint International, Sprint's
global telecommunications subsidiary.  "We've found Telebit to be an
outstanding source of high-speed, reliable modems, assuring optimum
service and support to our customers."

"This agreement points out the growing importance of remote network
access systems in today's business environment," said James D. Norrod,
president and CEO of Telebit.  "With this agreement, Sprint has again
asserted its role as a global data communications leader by offering
seamless services using advanced remote network access system products
to facilitate electronic commerce.  Moreover, we believe this network
will provide a highly efficient method for Sprint customers to sell,
distribute and support their products and services."

The FastBlazer 8840's data rates are among the highest in the
industry, up to 115.2 kilobytes per second with compression.
Available in both rack-mount and standalone configurations, the
V.34-standard modem provides users with maximum flexibility in data
network design.  The FastBlazer 8840 adheres to worldwide government
and industry data communications standards, helping companies like
Sprint in their rapid deployment of data services.

Telebit Corporation is a global market leader in developing and
manufacturing on-demand, remote-access solutions for multi-platform
computer networks.  The company's dial-up routers and modems are
especially well-matched to five key market segments: telecommuting,
business-to-business on-demand routers, nomadic computing, network
access providers, and industrial WANs.  Founded in 1982, Telebit
invented dial-up routing with the original NetBlazer(r) router,
opening the door to on-demand remote access.  The NetBlazer family and
Telebit's broad line of high-speed modems are used by Fortune 1000
customers worldwide for financial, industrial, medical, retail,
government, and academic applications.  The company has offices in the
United States, Europe and Asia, and markets its products worldwide
through value-added resellers, wholesale distributors and OEMs.

Sprint Corporation is a diversified international telecommunications
company with more than $12.6 billion in annual revenues, and the
United States' only nationwide all-digital, fiber-optic network.  Its
divisions provide global long-distance voice, data and video products
and services; local telephone services to more than 64 million
subscriber lines in 19 states; and cellular operations serving more
than one million customers in nearly 100 cities in 14 states.


Telebit and NetBlazer are registered trademarks and FastBlazer is a
trademark of Telebit Corporation.

Reply-To: prichard@dseg.ti.com


I need some ideas for "quiet" communications for inter and intra-canoe
communications.  The Heard Museum in McKinney,Tx has recently started
a "wetlands" trail tour but hasn't decided how to communicate quietly
from the trail guide to the other boaters.  The whole wetlands tour is
brand-new but what they have in mind is to have three or four canoes in 
the water with two people per canoe.  However the people have to be
able to ask questions and listen to the trail guide.  It would have to
be lightweight because they have to portage across a couple levees.

I was thinking about those tour (motor)cyclist that use some
communication.  I think it has to be electronic and has to be a
headset/microphone but I would like lots of ideas to think about. The
reason I think it has to be a headset or earphone arrangement is so
the incoming voice signal doesn't scare/disturb the wildlife (have you
ever heard the walkie/talkies when accidently turned up loud?).

I don't exactly know what their operating budget is but considering
they use volunteers for most everything I am sure it isn't much.
Unfortunately, I don't think they can go out and buy 900Mhz phones.

Well, I guess that I should check the Internet more frequently.

1] NMS Vox File Format is hardly proprietary, and we'll be happy to send you 
a copy. Its pretty straight forward.  Please call 508/650-1333 and ask Marty 
for what you need.

2] The creators of ME/2 and VScript were disturbed to hear that they
had left NMS. They are about 50 feet from me now, busy on future products.
The person who designed the VBX-400 just walked by.

3] Our voice compression schemes are "proprietary".  We adopted one of
the pre-G.726 proposals (there were no adopted standards yet at that
time and we had to get to market) and have stayed with it.  Our
competitors chose a different pre-G.726 proposal, so the compression
schemes are not compatible and hence compressed speech files are not
interchangable.

I hope that this helps.  Feel free to contact us if you have more questions!

Subject: An Open Letter to PageAmerica


Re:  A Wonderful PR Opportunity ... 
 
 ... to put your $ where your mouth is.  I am a former PageAmerica
customer, with an old NEC beeper purchased a few years back from
PageAmerica.  Since that time, I have used a different service on the
same hardware, and am ready to change from my current service provider, 
a local "sleazy" retail beeper store.
 
I looked around and found that the beeper services in my neighborhood
use Motorola, and won't do a trade-in on an NEC.  So I went through
the Yellow Pages, and rediscovered PageAmerica.
 
I called the PageAmerica Wall Street-area office here in New York, and
spoke at length with a sales manager.  During the course of our
conversation, I made it clear that I was currently using the NEC
hardware with another local service, and now wanted to switch service
providers.
 
To my pleasure and surprise, he responded quite enthusiastically that
PageAmerica would be happy to upgrade my NEC to a newer numeric
beeper.  He offered me a NO-COST trade-in *AND* TRI-STATE service for
ONLY $6.50 per month.
 
And I thought, gee, these guys are brilliant.  Everyone else charges
for trade-ins, plus $12+ per month for tri-state reach.
 
I thought, PageAmerica is really on the competitive edge.  I couldn't
get to the nearest location soon enough!  But I called first -- to the
Madison Avenue at 42nd Street location -- and confirmed what I'd been
told by the downtown office.  They added that the $6.50 price tag was
conditional on a three-year contract, but everything else was exactly 
the same.
 
Well, I went to the Madison Avenue location this morning, and it was
another story entirely.  I was (rudely) informed that, with the
trade-in, my cost for a new beeper (similarly numeric) would be $50.
 
What happened to the NO-COST TRADE IN?  I explained repeatedly what I'd  
been told over the phone.  They told me it just didn't matter. 
 
Now, this is New York.  I encounter over-zealous selling -- bait and
switch -- and bad attitudes -- every day.  And it's only $50.  But I
do not do business that way.
 
Is there a PageAmerica exec out there who's willing back up their
employee's commitment to trade in and upgrade my NEC beeper at NO-COST?
 
I can be reached at 212 684-7210, or producer@pipeline.com.

Subject: Re: Any Experience With African Telecom (Tanzania)?


You will be stepping into a nightmare. Go get a copy of Paul Theroux's
_The Mosquito Coast_ (or rent the Harrison Ford/Helen Mirren movie),
multiply it by a factor of ten, and you will get the idea.

In many African countries, the phone system (as is much of the
infrastructure) is a relic of colonial times, and is in a state of
shocking disrepair.

Typically, the PTT is stocked with party hacks who don't know anything
about telecom, and won't do anything without a bribe.

I used to work for a company that made microwave transmission systems
that were sold around the world.  We sold a few to wealthy Africans
who spent >$300K on a point-to-point system, just so they would have a
reliable and secure way to call their office from their home(s).  The
systems were powered by generators and watched at all times by armed
guards.

I could go on, but people on this list have heard it all before ...

Extra Credit question: 

What do you think would happen, in a largely Muslim country, the first 
time somebody took a peek at alt.binaries.pictures.erotica?


Cheers,

  In fact this is really simple, and will depend on the type of
cellular network used. The function is called roaming. The following
description is for the GSM network, but I assume that other networks
will do similar things.

   When you are in your Home area, you will use many cells (not just
one). Your phone, when power up or after a timer (5mn?) will send a
message that will be picked by one of the radio equipment. This will
update a database (HLR for GSM) with your location. When someone is
calling you in your home area using the 317 xxx xxxx the database will
have the information of which cell to use to redirect the call.

   When you are outside of your Home area, the same scenario occurs,
but a second database is involved (VLR for GSM). When your phone send
the message (update location), the VLR is updated and because you are
not in your home area, it will update your home database (HLR) also.
When someone call you, your number is tied to your home database,
which will know which area you are in (which VLR) it can send send the
call to the VLR which knows exactly which cell you are in to triggered
the good radio eqipment (MSC)

   Depending on the kind of network, you may have to unblock the phone
to allow roaming, but I'm not sure of that.
   
   and YES, the caller will always dial your own number.

   The guy is right, the registration is automatic. Remember, the
system knows exactly which cell you are in, and will NEVER scan all
cell networks.

   It is really simple for the user (automatic registration).

There are various networks that connect cellular systems to one
another, and the one I am most familiar with is the NACN -- North
American Cellular Network.

The NACN is made up of about 75 cellular service providers who connect
together by way of SS7 signaling.  This allows switches to exchange
messages about their subscriber locations and features.  Take, for
example, a person from Seattle traveling to Denver ...

        1.  Customer turns phone on in Denver and automatically 
        initiates a message to their home switch in Seattle.

        2.  Seattle home switch automatically looks up the person's
        profile (features, capabilities, etc. ) and sends the information
        to Denver.

        3.  The Denver switch sets up a visitor location register for that
        subscriber.  The phone is now "registered" and call delivery
        is automatic.

What happens if someone calls the Seattle phone number?

        1.  The Seattle switch "remembers" that the person is in Denver.

        2.  Seattle will automatically send a message to Denver to check
        if the phone is still active and to get a temporary Denver number.

        3.  Denver returns the temporary Denver number to Seattle, and Seattle
        sends the call over the public network to that Denver number.

        4.  The call goes into the Denver switch, and Denver knows the
        temporary number belongs to a particular phone visiting from Seattle.

        5.  The Denver switch routes the call to the cellular phone.

The NACN covers about 4500 cities across America, Alaska, Canada, and
part of Mexico.  Right now, most of the NACN consists of "A-side"
cellular service providers.  However, many B-side carriers are now
connecting too.  The protocol that makes this happen is the "IS-41,
Rev. A" standard protocol.  NACN interconnects to other networks that
provide similar services.  One difference might be that the NACN is a
not-for-profit organization.  It covers its operating expenses and
keeps rates low.

Each cellular subscriber is associated with a "home" switch or
database location.  The network does not need to search through all
systems to find you.  As soon as you turn your phone on, you are
"found."  The visited system needs to have a link to your home system
and has to have an idea where that home system is.  Right now, each
switch has tables that associate a person's phone number with their
home system and routes the signaling messages accordingly.  If you
move into another cellular system that is still on the network, that
system will pick you up and notify your home system of your location.
The location is general (to one switch that covers a large area), and
not down to the cell level.


Hope this helps, 

b.s.

        
[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Regards the assignment of a 'temporary
number' which the home carrier then outdials over the public network,
some cellular hackerphreaks have discovered that if you can find out
what block of phone numbers is used by the carrier in your home area
for 'temporary assignments' then you can program a cell phone to one
of those numbers and receive incoming calls and place outgoing calls
via that number at no charge if the carrier is not too smart. 

For example, let us say Cellular One in Chicago uses numbers in the
312-659-00xx series for temporary assignment to folks passing through
town. If in Chicago and you program your cellphone to 312-659-00xx,
whatever 'xx' may be, then anyone who dials that number will get 
through to you just fine; the cellular switch won't complain about
it at all. There is no ESN checking, of course -- at least there did
not used to be on 'temporary numbers', so with quite a few carriers
you can even make outgoing calls at no charge if programmed to one
of those numbers. So this is a good way, some contend, to use a cell-
phone as a very fancy pager. You can get called, and speak on the 
call. If you need to make a call out and you are challenged or
thwarted by the switch, well ... you can always go to a payphone or
whatever. Check out the 'temporary assignment numbers' in your
community and see if this works. Oh, and dudez, don't forget the
reason your landline phone has the "*", "6", and "7" buttons on it
when you dial into the xxx-7626 (xxx-ROAM) port in your community,
although by all means, try direct dial to the temporary number also.  PAT]

Subject: Re: I Just Bought a CT2 Phone and I Love It


After reading several articles on the net regarding CT2 phones
(greenpoint for me here in Holland) I decided to buy one, and so I
went to the phoneshop and bought one last Thursday. Despite the fact
the phone only works in certain area's of town, I already like it very
much. The phone has a build in numeric pager, so people can reach me
anywhere in the country. Here in Holland it's not possible to call a
CT2 phone, only page.  The phone rate on the CT2 phone is two times the
"normal" rate. This way toll-free numbers stay toll free and local
calls are cheaper then long distance ones. This is quite different
from the GSM network here in Holland where you pay a fixed rate per
minute. Also the monthly charge here is lower ($6,00 per month or
$13,00 including the pager subscription). GSM here is at the cheapest
$30,00 a month with a city space subscription.

I can understand some people are sceptic about the whole CT2 network,
especially since it was terminated in the UK and the idea of having to
be in the area of a greenpoint to use your phone. Yet, when you want a
cordless phone and be able to make phonecalls on the street, CT2 is a
pleasant and cheap solution! It certainly beats the analog 30-32mhz
phones.  I have tried to locate the frequency of the phone with my
scanner, but I have been unable to locate it (so far). According to my
information it should be between 864 and 868 mhz or between 1880 and
1900 mhz. Information on this is welcome.

Organization: Discordians for "Bob"


This may be the most terrifying thing I've read in weeks.

Forgive me for using a non-telecom example, it's the only one I'm
thoroughly familiar with. You see, here in St. Louis, we only had one
vivid example of Milken and Boesky's benificence, and here's the way I
remember what I read about it in the papers.

Carl Icahn used a gigantic pile of junk bonds to take over, then take
private, what was at the time one of America's premier airlines, Trans
World Airlines, or TWA.  Everybody in St. Louis, more or less,
followed this story carefully; TWA uses St. Louis as a hub, and it's a
major employer here.

Yeah, there was a management shakeup, and yes, there were dramatic
cuts in costs. As best can be told in retrospect, those cuts that
didn't come from slashing worker's salaries were mostly in aircraft
maintenance and replacement, the bread and butter of running an
airline. The money that was freed up didn't go into improving airline
productivity. It went into the pockets of the bondholders and into
Carl Icahn's pockets. You see, even though (due to obscene interest
expenses) the airline lost money every year he ran it, every year he
ran it he hiked his salary.  When he'd bled every asset out of the
company he could, and it obviously couldn't keep the bills paid and
the planes in the air, he bailed out, taking nothing with him except,
of course, whatever he'd saved from many millions of dollars in
salary.

He would've gotten away with it completely, too, if he hadn't gotten
one step too greedy and looted the pension fund.  The feds made him
pay part of that money back. That took him, if memory serves, from
megamillionaire down to merely a multimillionaire ... for this, we're
supposed to feel sorry for him.

TWA managed to keep the doors open, barely. They went employee-owned,
got some debt forgiveness, and yet more wage concessions from the
employees, made some clever marketing moves, sold off yet more routes,
and against all odds have managed to crawl back into business. They
still haven't figured out how they'll afford to replace planes as they
die, and they're flying one of the oldest fleets in the air. It's a
much smaller and poorer business than it was when Carl Icahn took it
over, but they're justifiably proud of having survived him at all.

This kind of "efficiency," well known also to anybody who's followed
the story of Georgia-Pacific and many other companies that were the
victims of hostile LBOs -- this kind of leverage, the telecommunications 
industry does =not= need.

I lived in Alabama until late January. My mother is still there.
Permissive dialing ended in May of this year for the 205/334 split in
Alabama. She told me the businesses in South Alabama sued to get
permissive dialing involuntarily extended by BellSouth and that they
lost. Alabama is the first state (to my knowledge) to have the new NPA

Usually I am in agreement with Patrick, but here I completely
disagree.  I live in a complex with security gates at the entrance.
Unlike the system Patrick described above, it is a computerized system
with a digital display/directory. The visitors look up my name from
the directory if they don't already know my code, and punch it in.
The system uses a *regular* POTS line and places a call to my
apartment.

If I'm on the line, the call rolls to the second, just like any other
call.  If I chose to have call waiting instead of two lines, it would
interrupt my call but I would be able to control the interruption with
*70.  What I object to in the scenario above, is that no matter how
you have your lines set up, the gate device will put CW tones onto
your call and (probably) kill a modem.

There's also little flexibility when it comes to call handling.  If
I'm not here and have my calls forwarded to my cell phone, the gate
call will get forwarded too. (Some may say this is a Bad Thing, but I
like being able to let the person know when I'm coming back or where I
am.) If I wanted to have a special ring for gate calls, I could put
Distinctive Ring/Ringmate on the line.  But whatever I decide, it is
ME deciding, not the management deciding for me.

I guess I a) don't trust the management to do the job right, and b)
object to someone else limiting my options on *MY* pairs.


Steve   cogorno@netcom.com


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The original thinking behind this, when
Illinois Bell was marketing Enterphone was that while most people would
probably not object to having their phone line busied out with *70
against another phone call, but probably would object if their choice
was to lose control of their front door in the process. It was also
thought that most people probably would not want their front door calls
to be forwarded to an answering service or wherever they had forwarded
their line in their absence. The thinking was most people would not want
to risk the possibility of a stranger at their door *knowing for certain*
they were not at home. The thinking was also that since many/most apart-
ments have two pairs -- if not necessarily two working lines -- that in
the event a resident demanded the kind of control over his line that you
suggest, they could request the door to be brought up on the idle pair or
(if both in use) the line not usually needed for 'critical' applications
such as modems, etc. In other words, if your residence has at least two
pairs, then you can have your cake and eat it too. Put your modem and/or
more often used line on one pair, with the front door on the other pair
and lesser-used, modem-unlikely line. Whether or not it is a good or bad
idea to let front door visitors know when you will be back home is a matter
of debate and application on a user by user basis I guess.    PAT]

The commercial Ma Bell supplied equipment is pretty good.  The
signboard/unit directory is OK, and the phone unit is built a lot like
a payphone, except there is a speakerphone instead of a handset.  The
aftermarket stuff I've seen (Nutone/Executone type stuff, etc) is all
over the map -- some is junk, some is better.  (Note -- I am not naming
Nutone or Executone specifically -- just using them as an example of
non-Ma Bell manufacturers)

<excellent description of two Ma-Bell systems trimmed>

I've seen several different branded systems in the LA area -- the Ma
Bell systems are the best.  The other ones are "canned solutions" in
that they are sold by local interconnct houses or apartment house/condo 
supply companies and are a (big) "black box" that hooks to a pots line
and is programmed and that's it.  They use regular call waiting, and a
"7" (or any other progammed digit) as an open code.  There is no "deny" 
code - the recipient just switches back to the other call.  Most use a
"1" as teh start digit, some use "*".

All the non-Ma-Bell systems except one -- yes, ALL but one -- that I have
encountered in the last ten years have been disabled within four years after
I first encountered them (note -- I would have encountered them visiting
friends in buildings equipped with them, as I live in a regular house
and have since 1965).  Generally the cheapie systems get removed, or at
least the electrobagnetic latch in the gate gets removed, and a "out of
order" sign is put over the keypad (i.e. the directory is left in use).

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The other thing he needs to do is insist
on very prompt repair when the system is out of order for obvious reasons.
When Illinois Bell was doing it, their guarantee was a FOUR HOUR turnaround
at any time day or night when the circuit to the front door went out of
order (the building owner had to supply the latching mechanism and the
stepdown transfer and wires; all IBT did was maintain the 'door opening
circuit' to that point), and an EIGHT HOUR turnaround on the repair of
any given apartment line. That included Sundays and holidays, overnight,
etc.

And they were good at keeping their word on that part of it when they
could otherwise get their act together, which they did eventually. Let me
explain: The jumpers from the common equipment in the central office to
the frames (except they don't use frames in ESS, but anyway ...) had to
be tagged and clearly marked. The pairs going out from the CO to the
subscribers in that building had to be clearly marked 'front door intercom
service, do NOT remove or reassign'. Every telephone pole and manhole
from there to the subscriber had to have the pairs noted as dedicated.
Every basement of every other apartment building on the block where those
pairs were multipled had to be checked, with the pairs plainly marked
as dedicated to the '<address> building'. Well, in a crowded central
office in an older urban area where the pairs are all in a mess anyway
and no one knows what half of them are for or where they go, you can
imagine how successful IBT was at getting installers to keep their 
hands to themselves when they were trying to get a line for a new
subscriber somewhere in the vicinity, etc. A lot of telco installers
think a pair without dialtone on it is fair game. 

So in one case for about a month after the installation was complete,
it was an on-again, off-again thing as telco would keep swapping pairs
where an installer had stolen one for someone else. The manager of
the apartment building was very hip and knowledgeable about this, and
he would deliberatly go to vacant units and plug in a phone, then have
someone downstairs at the door signal him. No signal? ... snap! He would
be on the phone to repair in a minute to get 'his' dedicated pair back. 
Newer telco service reps would give him the story that 'we only supply
it for occupied apartments with phone service turned on'. No you don't,
he would answer. We pay a dollar per month per apartment regardless
(along with $35 per month for the common equipment in the central office,
$5 per month for the front door phone and $2 per month for the door-
opening circuit), so give me all the pairs I am paying for! Telco would
squirm at that; they dearly needed the dozen or so pairs at any given
time that he was *not* using (vacant apartments) but he said tough ...

Then one day came the big flood ... sewer repair crews excavating in 
the street nearby broke a large water main. Water poured into the IBT
hole and knocked out phone service over a two or three block area for
a day; including guess what?  Umm hmm ... the front door service at
that building. So personally I would go with premises equipment any day
over the central office version. Maybe its just as well that kindly old
Judge Greene made Bell quit offering the service. At the building I am
discussing here, when their contract with IBT ran out they bought their
own system from GTE. It took them about a year to amortize it versus
their monthly payments to IBT. In any event, make sure *someone* knows
how to fix it and responds promptly on request. Otherwise you have a
helluva mess; the front door has to be left propped open, etc.   PAT]

PairGain in Cerritos, CA (last time I checked) makes some sort of
thingy that lets you run data up to five miles if I recall correctly.
I think they call it the "Campus-T1" if memory serves.  It's supposed
to allow FDDI over copper.  I can check for more details, but they ran
an ad in {Data Communications} magazine.  I don't know anything about
the product other than what it says in the ad though.

Spread-Spectrum radio is **VERY** expensive.  I have looked into these
options as well.  Do you know if there are any models that cost under
$1000 each?

the statement, 'that means mother-fu__ers'. But he spelled it out. Since
I publish a family-oriented journal here, I have to use blanks for some
letters. The newspaper did not catch this until after it had been printed
and was on the street. They fired the guy who did it and apologized to
the advertisers affected. Things will slip through.   PAT]

I did not even know that they were not allowed to overcharge in the
past.  Whenever I had to use a phone in a hotel I felt like when
you're taking a taxi ride outside of the airport in a foreign country:
you don't know which road you'll take and you don't know how much
you'll be charge for.

A good suggestion is for you to use your calling card as many LD
providers offer access from France. I remember that some hotel we were
staying at was claiming that there was no way to reach an ATT operator: 
that was plain wrong!  19 <wait for tone> 0011 gets you ATT for example. 
Some LD companies give you an operator while some others give you a
tone which is more convenient for modem calls

We manufacture a complete line of analog and digital signaling
conversion products.  The unit you require is the Model TSC100 Trunk
Signaling Converter.  Your requirement suggests the need to convert
from the R2 signaling format to possibly a TUP SS7 link.

  In order for us to provide a quotation, we require the following
information:

        1.  Country specific or SS7 signaling plan (i.e. TUP or ISUP,
etc.)
        2.  Specification on the link requirements (i.e. T1 or E1, number
of trunks, redundant signaling link, 
                   etc.)
        3.  Specification on input power requirements.
        4.  Numbering plan to be used.

  The TSC100 is a modular rack mounted system consisting of a common
equipment 3U (5.25 inch) rack mounted chassis, DC Converter, CPU and
up to twelve (12) trunk modules which can interface either T1 or E1
links.

  SS7 signaling channels can be extracted from any DSO by user command
via a control terminal link.  This same link offers the flexibility to
configure parameters for both the R2 and SS7 sides.

  Additionally, the same platform allows signaling conversion for R2, C5,
China 1, MF, R1, and many other custom derivatives of the above types.

  Support for primary rate ISDN (i.e. 23B +D and 30B+D) to SS7 ISUP is
also possible along with channel re-mapping with our digital crossconnect
module which supports a full 360 DSO crossconnect within the same chassis
concurrent with the signaling conversion.

In Sweden a slightly different approach has been taken.  The analog
NMT900 is defined for the same frequency band as GSM.  Telia, which
has a monopoly on NMT service, has been quarreling with the two
independent GSM operators (Telia runs GSM as well) about how to
increase capacity in Sweden's (especially Stockholm's) GSM networks.

Telia wanted 1800 MHz frequencies for DCS but the other two wanted to
dismantle NMT900.  There is an EC directive that says that 900 MHz
should be reserved for GSM and that other analog networks should be
"phased out" but that certain considerations should be made.  A
timeplan for the dismantling of analog netwoks is however required.

There was a compromise and Telia has to hand over some 2.3MHz (about
1/5) from their NMT900 operation to Comviq GSM, Europolitan GSM and
Telia GSM by March 1 1996.  Another revision is scheduled for next
autumn.  But there is still no plan on further reduction of NMT
frequencies.  Most probably 1800 will eventually be used just as in
Finland, but no decisions have yet been made.

Ny reflection to all this is will the introduction of DCS make GSM
cheeper, i.e. will the prices drop to LD rate?  Any experiences from
the UK or Germany?

I worked for AT&T as a TSPS operator (just after divestiture, AT&T was
still handling dial-0 for RBOC's). The TSPS console can be very
intimidating if you weren't trained properly. Our training, done in
pairs, lasted two weeks. Two mind-numbing, coma-inducing weeks of
repeated interactive audio tapes of people asking different things of
the Operator (actually, the interactive training system was more
technologically advanced than the TSPS console itself <g>).

I worked the "graveyard" shift (11PM to 7AM) in the Rochelle Park, NJ,
NJ Bell Building. We serviced most of Northern NJ, from Union City in
Hudson County, to Hackensack, to Paterson. Do you know what happens to
a TSPS board at 2AM when the bars close -- not a pretty site!

The only reason a coin call would appear at the position was if the
phone was not registering coins, or the call being placed cost more
than $3.00. For the former, we had to listen for the tones made by the
slot mechanism (five for a quarter, two for a dime,etc..). For the
latter, it's as Pat stated -- we would have to stop the caller from
depositing and hit COLLECT to swallow the coins. However, this
sometimes presented a problem. In 1983, the TSPS consoles we used
could *not* split calling party from called party (old plugboards
could do this no problem). So for example, if someone wanted to make a
person-to-person call to Turkey (for say $11.00), policy stated that
we begin the forward dialing, wait for a party to acknowledge, and
then tell calling party to begin depositing, all this while the called
party was on-line and waiting. In fact, they would often start
talking, and we would have to interrupt them and insist that they
continue depositing. Sometimes, they'd get just enough chatter through
our demands to stop, then they'd hangup.  Nothing we could do about it.

If you did happen to hit return and not collect, the display would
show that the money was not collected. Also, the TSPS console was
configured so that it gave you visual clues what to do next. When a
coin call arrived, the display showed amount due and amount deposited
so far. The button labeled POS REL (for POSITION RELEASE) was the
button to release the call for normal timing. It would only light if
the deposited amount equalled the due amount, in which case you'd
press it once. If you needed to override, you'd have to press it twice
as a confirmation.

The mistake I made all too often (to the dismay of the TSPS monitoring
team in Piscataway NJ) was release a call without selecting a rate
class. Before starting forward dialing and pressing POS REL, a rate
could have to be selected (station, DDD, oper,Pers to Pers, etc..).
However, a call could still be released from the position without
selecting a rate (free call). If you were fast, you'd sometimes miss
the rate button and fly right onto POSREL. Lucky caller!

BTW, the correct acronym is TSPS, which stands for Telephone Services
Position System (I think -- nobody actually ever told us -- found out
many years later).

Oh, the stories I could tell ...

I can't speak for any other vendor, but in the 5ESS(R) Switch, the
exact same device, engineered in the same way is used to decode pulse
and tone inputs.  There is no separate engineering input based on how
many customers have one type or the other.

Hello Direct has exactly the device you are looking for.  Native it
stores up to 1,000 phone numbers.  They also make a model that
connects to the PC or MAC.  The base unit, unfortuantely, is $499 and
the PC/MAC model is $699.  You can reach them at 800-444-3556.

Boy, can I relate to this!  We are trying to do the same thing at my
company.  We bought four sight/four link fax server software that was
specifically configured for the Northern platform.  We have it all set
to go but we can't get the PBX to deliver DTMF tones to the server.

Pick a friendly location in the "foreign" area where you want a
presence.  Depending on how the telco computes mileage, you might be
better off if this is physically close to your actual location.  This
can be a friend's house or anywhere where you can get two phone jacks
installed.

Tell the Great Telephone Experiment that you're opening an office,
you'll have a PBX, and need an off-premise station from your PBX to
your actual location.  Order a loop-start trunk for the PBX.

The telco will install a jack at the location with dialtone, and a jack 
to connect to your "extension".  Get a cord with modular plugs on both 
ends.  This is your "PBX".  Plug it in to both jacks (you might have to 
reverse the wires on one end).  Done.

Subject: Blind - But Working With ACD - And Some Other Stuff


Hi all!

     Don't know if any of you can shed any light on this problem, but, I
thought I'd put it out there and see what happens.

     I am a blind computer user currently employed by World Carpets as
a Customer Service Representative.  My job involves answering calls
and taking, checking status and otherwise maintaining carpet orders.
I receive the calls from an ACD system.  For the most part, I can use
the telephone set quite well.  I know what and where all the important
buttons are and have a good working knowledge of how the PBX I'm on
handles things like call transfer, forwarding and the like.  Where I
run into the most difficulty is with the little things.

     For example, when I'm working on an order and don't wish to
receive any calls for a short period, I press what all the reps call
the "WORK" button (I've got a manual somewhere in here, but, don't
feel like having someone look in it to get me the proper name).  I
have a light sensor which I can position over the light (or led?) that
indicates the state of the buttons, and it squawks when they're lit.
Sometimes, however, I am working on something and forget to turn off
the "WORK" button.  The guy next to me kind-of keeps an eye out, and
alerts me if he sees that I'm "on WORK", but, sometimes he's too busy,
and I've forgotten about pressing the button to begin with:-).  

With the right knowledge in wiring, a person could rig up a device
that would beep every so often if the "WORK" button was on, and
something could be built into the software for this too.  The phone
set already alerts you if a caller is on hold for more than two
minutes (I think) by sounding the ringer every second.  Other problems
may not be so simple, however.  The sets give the other sighted reps
information about which group of lines a call is coming in on, give
Message-Waiting indication, who's calling (from inside the PBX) and
various statistics about call traffic.

     I've heard rumors about blind people working as operators
(probably on TSPS), and would guess that similar problems had to be
met there.  Any of you have any ideas as to how some of these problems
can be solved in my case?  Aside from this, how were they dealt with
back in the days of TSPS?  Are there any blind operators using OSPS?
I've heard that OSPS uses a more graphical interface.  The GUI is
being tackled in the PC and MAC worlds (along with others [I think]),
but, don't know what was done when AT&T migrated to OSPS.  I'd be
interested to hear about that as well.  Were there any blind operators
who's jobs could not be done as efficiently, or did AT&T already have
a solution in place when they started using OSPS?

     Back to the PBX.  I'm using an ACD on a NEC 2400 (according to
the person in charge of telecommunications at World).  That's the only
helpful thing I can provide, but, give me some other questions to ask
and I'll give them a shot.  If we used an AT&T PBX, could a blind user
use the "Remote Agent" system AT&T uses in some offices?  I've talked
to a rep (or two) who was working from his/her home using a "Remote
Agent" system on an ACD on an AT&T PBX.  What kind of feedback and
control could this offer?

     Anyway, that's enough from me:-).  Any suggestions?  Drop me a
line.

%T   "The Internet"
 
The cover describes this as "the official book of the Public
Television presentation, 'The Internet Show'".  It is a kind of
"computer literacy" level introduction to the Internet, with lots of
pictures and lots of white space, and not much text.  (Some of the
pictures and sidebar comments will make little sense unless you have
seen the show.)
 
Within the limits of the space allowed, the text is clear and
readable.  Explanations of what the Internet is, and what you can do
with it, are good, but very short on "how".  NetManage's Chameleon
software for Windows is provided with the book, and a set of "Instant
Internet" providers who have agreed to handle billing for both
software and service.  Unfortunately, a) this is only good in areas of
the United States, and b) the book, itself, is far from clear on your
license for use with providers outside this group.  Nevertheless, if
you wish to use one of the providers from the list, the setup is quite
well automated.  (The "registration" number for the software does work
from Canada, and I've been told that a "perpetual license" for the
software costs U$50.  Some of the access providers listed do also
provide access from Canada.)
 
For those wishing to use the Internet in other ways, the lack of
detail may be frustrating.  As noted above, chapter three, on Internet
tools and applications, does not explain use.  Even more surprising is
chapter four, "Interesting Content", which does describe some
absorbing sites on the net, but, aside from newsgroup names, doesn't
give a single, specific address.  (Neither does chapter five,
"Searching for Information on the Internet".  Not even InterNIC.)

Subject: 911 From Cellphones in CA


I am part of a local government group working on a public information
peice about using cellphones to reach "911". Personally I have had
some bad experiences here in CA with the cellular psap personnel not
being very well trained.

I am seeking personal experiences both good and bad that involve using
cellular 911 for situations that were not the jurisdiction of the
Highway Patrol. (mail to droid@nbn.com) I am mainly interested in
California, but if you have an interesting tale from another state or
country please chime in.

Background: In California the calls from cellphones to "911" are sent
to the California Highway Patrol dispatch center for that region. The
call taker at that location must determine what jurisction you are in
and what service you need, they then route you to the agency that
handles that situation.  Unfortunatly they can't send you into the
PSAP for that region so you can be handled like a regular 911 call by
someone familiar with that area. They also have some bad phone numbers
in their lists. (I was sent to the SFPD TDD desk when I asked for an
ambulance in San Francisco.)

I have spoken with the supervisor for the Golden Gate region and have
helped clear some of their problems. But they still persist.

I'd also like to hear form persons involved in the design of how future
cell systems can handle 911 calls better.

to say the least.  PAT]

This mobile sculpture (length 21,8 meters, weight 1800 kg) by
R. Kriesche is physically positioned in the Austrian Pavilion during
the Biennale of Venice.

T.S.4 is driven by the data flow in Internet according to the relation
of the world wide computer newsgroups versus world wide art newsgroups.  
According to this relation T.S.4 will transcross the Austrian Pavilion 
during the time of the biennale and might even break through the wall
of the Pavilion.

You are invited to become part of T.S.4 by:

  o  visiting its www homepage:
     http://iis.joanneum.ac.at/kriesche/biennale95.html;

  o  discussion about T.S.4 on Usenet news;

  o  sending e-mail to T.S.4 (mailto:ts4@iis.joanneum.ac.at).

Your participation will slow down the movement of T.S.4 and prevent it
crashing.

Thank you for slowing down the speed of T.S.4.

According to the momentanous and longterm information flow on

Hello,

I am looking for information on setting up some NTI PBX's on a peer to

for ethernet (although it is rumored that the ethernet port on the
Commercial Processor, Option 81, 61C, 51C etc, will give this), I am
more looking at some type of serial protocol converter to allow SDI
input/output to be connected via PTP.  If anyone has tried this, I am
interested in how you did it, and with what type of equipment.


Thanks in advance,

Bill:

I have a lot of experience integrating this kind of system.  I can
build it for you if you wish.

The system configuration will be influenced by the following issues:

1. What is your estimated call volume?  When you install your voice
response unit (VRU), you will need to decide how many concurrent
callers you need to serve.  To do this, you might start with an
estimate of your total daily calls, and the average call duration.
Next, estimate how many total "connect" minutes are expected during
the busiest hour.  Then, specify what service level is necessary (what
percent of the calls should get a busy signal?).  Using Erlang C
formulas, you can then determine how many ports (phone lines,
simultaneous callers) are necessary.  A single fast computer (486 or
pentium) running OS/2 or UNIX can handle up to (approx.) 48
simultaneous callers using modern voice processing hardware.

2. What type of phone number will be used?  The type of phone service
influences the selection of the voice processing hardware.  If you are
using POTS lines, you'll need analog voice processing hardware.  If
you're using DID, you'll need to use specially configured hardware.
If you plan to use "800" type numbers, you might save a lot of money
by using T1 service to the carrier's POP.

3. How will the valid authorization codes be defined?  How often will
they be updated?  This will influence the type of database you'll use.
You'll need to decide whether to use a local database engine running
on the VRU, or if a networked server is best.  Of course, if you try
to use a networked server, performance considerations become critical.
The size of the database is also a consideration.  For many
applications, BTRIEVE is a good, inexpensive choice for OS/2
environments, and Informix should be considered for UNIX environments.

4. Will the VRU be located at a staffed or un-staffed location?  This
will determine the level of remote maintenance capability required by
the system.

5. Will the "merge into database" be performed manually, or automatically?

As I said earlier, you'll probably use a 486/pentium machine, running
OS/2 or UNIX (NT might also be considered, but the available drivers
and tools for the older operating systems tend to be more mature and
stable at this time).  There are some Windows run-time tools
available, but I think Windows is not sufficiently reliable,
especially if you need remote maintenance capability. You will then
need to select what brand/type of voice processing subsystem to use.

Choose from the following list: 

Market leaders:
        Natural Microsystems (508) 650-1300
        Dialogic (201) 993-3030
        Rhetorex (408) 370-0881

Other vendors:
        Linkon (212) 753-2544
        Pica (613) 591-1555
        New Voice (703) 648-0585
        Bicom  (203)268-4484

To program your application, you can choose from the following options:

1. Develop from scratch in "C".

2. Use one of the commercially available applicatoins generators. 
    (your voice processing hardware vendor can recommend)

3. Use one of the commercially available "scripting" languages.  There
are some"extended Basic-like" languages out there, with hooks capable
of interfacingwith your voice processing hardware.  There also a few
Visual Basic programming tools available, but I have already voiced my
opinion of Windows and NT for run-time reliability.

Of course, you can buy all of the above, already integrated (except
for the specific programming of you application)with a service
contract from a VRU manufacturer, e.g. AVT (206)820-6000 or Brite
Voice (316) 652-6500.

Good luck, and let me know if I can be of further assistance!

Subject: Caller-ID With Name From Centrex
Date: Wed, 07 Jun 95 16:45:00 GMT


About a year ago, the Orleans Parish (county) School Board went to a 
'City-Wide Centrex'.

I am an election poll-worker, and the precinct where I work at is at a
neighborhood elementary school.  Prior to the conversion to city
centrex, when I would call someone (locally) with Caller-ID with NAME,
the number of the line I was calling from, plus the name of the actual
school would show up on the box.  Since converting to city centrex,
the name shows up as 'Orleans Parish'.

City Hall's offices are on a centrex within the 'main' SCBell switch.
Calls comming from city council staff offices and other city hall
offices show up as 'City of New Orleans' (I think is is truncated
after so many characters).

Calls from the public (taxpayer supported) hospital's PBX or Centrex
all show up 'Charity Hospital' with a number.  Calls from MOST
hospitals are from a PBX (an outgoing trunk line shows up, with the
name of the hospital).  Calls from hospitals on what I think to be a
Centrex show up with the name of the hospital and the number which
rings right to the room.  Also, those centrex hospitals have no extra
delay when I call in.

*69 WILL quote back the number in all cases, but does NOT necessarily
allow me to *69 'back' to the number - under 'normal' circumstances,
you can 'flash' (dialpulse/rotary '1') or touch (DTMF) '1' and *69
will either ring to that number OR put you in a queue if that number
is 'busy'; *69 also does NOT allow me to ring back to calls
originating via WILTEL or local SCB calls from an SCB Telco payphone,
but in both cases, it does quote the number.

Caller ID does NOT show numbers originating via the 'A' or 'B'
Cellular systems in New Orleans - you get OUT OF AREA. All *69 says
that 'Touchstar' is not available for that number on ANY out-of-area
calls.

A call originating from Baton Rouge LA via Wiltel showed the name with
the number and time on my ID box.

Back to the 'city-wide-centrex' with the Public Schools -- ALL line
numbers were changed when the School Board went to this type of
centrex -- but the numbers were still assigned as part of their
geographic wirecenter switches -- and ALL outgoing calls out of the
Centrex service list had to be prefixed with 9.

Payphones usually show up on caller-ID with the line number and the
name 'PAYPHONE', whether Bell or Private.  In a few cases, if the
payphone is ALSO the directory number of the business it is located
at, the name of the business (sometimes truncated) will show instead
of the word Payphone (again whether Bell or Private).

ALSO, calls from any FED alphabet soup agency locally (Post Office,
FCC, IRS, congressmen offices, etc) show the number of the originating
line (in its geographic wirecenter switch) but the display 'U S
GOVERNMENT' and I think that is truncated at some point.  I don't know
if what agency is calling, but I do have an idea as to where in the
area it is located -- similar to the Public Schools city-wide-centrex
situation.

Date: 7 Jun 1995 22:11:34 GMT

TSPS stood for "Traffic Service Position System".  It replaced an
older system "Traffic Service Position".  To the operators, the
consoles and operation were very similar.  I believe behind the scenes
TSPS was electronic and programmable, while TSP was not.

To customers, when TSP/TSPS came the big change was automated dialed for
0+ calls (collect, credit card, 3rd party, notify, etc) and 1+ calls
from coin.

In other words, before TSP, the only dialable long distance were station
1+ from NON-coin phones.  All other LD calls had to go through the
operator.

With TSP, 1+ (station) calls from coin phones went through fast.  The
operator got a display of the amount due (since the customer already
dialed the number the machine knew what amount to display), and the
operator orally requested and collected the amount.  The machine did
timing, and got an operator back on for overtime.

Likewise for 0+ calls, the operator didn't have to ascertain the calling
data.  For credit card calls, she could merely key the number in

Operator rooms were much more pleasant -- TSP has nice consoles in
carpeted rooms, unlike the cramped noisy cord boards.

However, many veteran operators preferred the manual handling of calls
via cord -- they felt more involved.  Operators enjoyed the
occassional special cord where, despite automation, she had to relay
the call through toll centers the old way.  (Around 1980, I had
trouble placing an LD call, and the operator routed this way -- very
interesting how she called up the various toll centers.  I suppose
this kind of manual handling isn't done any more.)

As time went on, many of these features were further automated -- now 1+
coin calls are handled wholly by machine, as are credit card calls.

In my area (NW Philadelphia), our straight 0 (operator) calls were
handled through a traditional cord board in one location, while our 1+
coin and all 0+ were handled at another.

Are the TSPS consoles still used or have they been replaced with real
computer terminals?  (TSPS had "nixie tubes" displaying just digits.)

Is anyone familiar with _cord_ board toll and assistance switchboards?
I think the Bell System got rid of the last one around 1985.  There
were plenty around in the late 1970s.

In my area, we had TSPS handle our long distance, but basic 0 still went
to a cord board.

I was wondering what kind of jack options, cord keys, and special keys
the operators had -- how much control did they have over routing calls?

For instance, to connect a local call, did the operator have jack strips
for various local exchanges, or merely dial the whole seven digit number?
(I assume they didn't have jacks for every line.)


Thanks.

Hi,

I am designing a least-cost-routing function for a switch. I was
wondering whether I should allow separate routing tables on a
per-tenant basis, or whether a single system-wide routing table would
be sufficient. I am kind of hung in the middle, and would appreciate
any suggestion that would help me choose the way to go.

I think the broadcast industry uses heavy-duty CD changers that will
last an eternity.

But watch out for the lawyers when you're buying CDs for this use.
Most of the recorded entertainment you can buy is explicitly licensed
only for personal entertainment at home and other very limited uses.
Using it for music-on-hold is probably a violation of this license,
and may result in your being charged for royalties by ASCAP, BMI, or
some similar organization.

We normally use a "Walkman" or "Boom Box" type.  I prefer the "Boom
Box" because it gives you both tape and radio back-up to the CD.  The
tape is useful for occasional "advertising on hold" messages, while
the radio is appreciated during crisis periods (ie Desert Storm).
Make sure the tape is the auto-reverse kind.  The first two I
installed were Sony units.  Cutover was in January 1992.  One lasted
about two years of continuous playing, the other is still going
strong.  Not bad for $120 apiece.

The Digital protocol is a Northen Telecom propriatary interface.  The

There are several different ways to look at this.  You may want to
investigate your BARS database LD 90, 87, 86.  This is where you will
need to look to see where your trunked calls are going.

You can also look at the CFN in LD 22, this tells you the hardware
configuration.

Check out the high end computer stores.  I know of a few people that
have them, but I don't know where they got them. 

Hope this helps, I have been working on Meridian 1 PBX's for several
years, and if there is any other info that I can help with let me
know.

Thomas, if your question is "Can I hook up a Fax on Demand (or any
other analog service like modem, voice mail, answering machine, etc)"
to analog ports on my SL-1 Option 61 and have it work?" the answer is
yes.

The digital connectivity of proprietary phones deals with how the PABX
communicates with its telephones (lights lights, paints displays, etc)
as well as carries the phone conversation.  An analog port simply
carries the conversation.  If your concerns go deeper, conact me via

Subject: Re: ANI vs Caller-ID
Date: 7 Jun 1995 20:20:30 GMT
Organization: McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc.
Reply-To: jcr@creator.nwest.mccaw.com


ANI is not CALLER ID. ANI is the billing number; Caller ID is the
Calling Party Number (CPN) delivered by ISUP SS7 signaling.

A cellular call to an 1-800 number is usually delivered on Type 1
trunks to the nearest LEC End Office (EO) using MF trunks without ANI
delivery (FGD is needed for ANI). The EO translates the 800 call and
delivers the call via FGD to a tandem office (TO) which performs a dip
to an SCP to determine the 800 carrier (800 Number portability) and
then routes the call to that carrier who makes another SCP dip to get
the translated number.

The ANI delivered to the carrier is the trunk id of the EO to TO, or
it could be based on the trunk id from the cellular office to the EO.
If the TO uses ISUP SS7 to the 800 carrier, the ANI is passed in the
Calling Party Number. Technically, the ANI is contained in the ISUP
IAM Charging Number when the ANI and the CPN are different. For
example, a call from an ISDN PBX could have a Charging Number of the
PBX and a CPN of the PBX extension number.

1-800 calls can be given from the cellular office to the TO via MF
FGD, in which case the ANI is a dummy for the cellular office. ISUP
SS7 is not available from LEC TOs to cellular carriers for FGD-type
access to long distance carriers. The cellular office indicates
CIC=110 to alert the TO to make the first SCP dip.

AT&T Wireless in Portland, OR has ISUP connections to the LEC TOs.
1-800 calls are routed, per Equal Access Consent Decree, to the LEC's
TOs via MF FGD. In Portland, any CELL ONE subscriber or roamer is able
to deliver their CPN to Portland landlines by prefixing *82 to the
dialed number and then press SEND (or block CPN by default or by
prefixing *67).

So it will be a long time before any cellular caller is able to hear
their ANI from the 1-800-MYANIIS translated number. It will not be a
long time before certain cellular callers are able to deliver their
CPN between carriers (December 1995).

Actually, the difference is even more fundamental than that.  A total
of 50 MHz is available to cellular service providers (25 MHz each for
land and mobile transmitters -- that's how you get full duplex!) in
the 800 MHz band (in North America).  A-band carriers operate at
roughly 824-835 and 869-880 MHz (the details of the channelization
aren't worth bothering with here) and B-band carriers operate at
835-849 and 880-894 MHz.  NOTE: A 1.5 MHz "slice" of spectrum is
reserved for the "A" side toward the end of what I've identified as
belonging to the "B" side).

As Pat pointed out, when the FCC first licensed cellular it assumed
that most -- if not all -- local phone companies would want a
franchise, so the "B" band of frequencies was assigned to them in
those markets where an interest was expressed in operating the
service.  "A" side frequencies were awarded to licensees via a (form
of) lottery, which resulted in some of the Mom & Pop systems still in
operation today.  There were, and are, regulations and restrictions
governing the sale of licenses, but through acquisition many "B" side
carriers also operate "A" side franchises -- such as Southwestern Bell
in Chicago and Boston (outside of its LEC markets, of course), and GTE
in much of the Southeast (through its acquisition of what used to be
Providence-Journal Cellular).  Hope that helps.

The "B" carrier here in central California is GTE known for its
wireline nothing fancy plain old telephone service in the small Town
of Los Gatos.  The GTE cellular system covers Santa Barbara to
Cloverdale, a seven hour drive local call.  Pac*Bell the RBOC in the

a telco from an other town.

Presumably you are referring to Council Directive 87/372/EEC of 25
June 1987 on the frequency bands to be reserved for the coordinated
introduction of public pan-European cellular digital land-based mobile
communications in the Community.

I am not aware of ANY European Union measure calling for the "phasing
out" of older analogue networks. The closest I have seen is the
"whereas" in this Directive which says "whereas on the basis of
present technological and market trends (*back in 1987 I remind you*)
it would appear realistic to envisage the exclusive occupation of the
890-915 and 935-960 MHz frequency bands by the pan-European system
within 10 years of 1 January 1991." Please tell me where you found the
"phasing out" statement.

For information: there is also a Council Recommendation 97/371/EEC of
25 June 1987 and a Council Resolution 90/C 166/02 of 28 June 1990
which relate to GSM frequencies.

*Sam's Comments on Sweden - very interesting*

> Most probably 1800 will eventually be used just as in Finland, but

I was under the impression that Telestyrelsen (the Swedish regulatory
authority for telecommunications) was preparing to grant up to five
specific DCS 1800 licences (some or all of which might be regional
rather than nation-wide).

> My reflection to all this is will the introduction of DCS make GSM

I am not a market analyst but I would say without much hesitation that
the UK mobile communications market was a fairly cosy duopoly until
the arrival of the two DCS 1800 operators. Mercury One-2-One entered
the market with very innovative tariffing schemes (such as free local
calls after business hours).

As for Germany, tariffs are going down, but I think it's early to attribute 
this very clearly to the arrival of E-Plus. 

The French Bouygues Telecom network is not yet operational. Bouygues 
Telecom has stated in its bid for the DCS 1800 licence that it expects to 
use its network infrastructure to compete with France Telecom for the 
provision of voice telephony (in the long run). 

The use of DCS 1800 frequencies for the provision of public mobile services 
in France is reserved exclusively to Bouygues Telecom for a limited period 
of 4 years but only in the five largest metropolitan areas of France, i.e. 
Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Lille and Nice. During this 4 year period, the two 
GSM operators will be excluded from using the DCS 1800 frequencies in the 
metropolitan areas of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Lille and Nice, except if 
they can demonstrate and justify that, within a specified geographical area 
and within strictly defined technical parameters, the 900 MHz frequency 
band is saturated.

France Telecom and Societe Frangaise du Radiotelephone (SFR), the two GSM 
and analogue cellular operators, have each been granted an authorisation 
for the operation, on an experimental basis, of a DCS 1800 network in and 
around a single regional capital (Toulouse for France Telecom and 
Strasbourg for SFR).

Why not use a distinctive ringing service?


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I think you miss the point. If they could
afford a fax machine, or to have a computer turned on at all times, then
distinctive ringing would be a solution since only those 'distinct' calls
would ever reach the computer they left turned on or the fax machine 
they cannot afford. But not being able to do those things, a third-party

One service that I am evaluating from NetOffice(.com) gives me a fax
number in the Atlanta area and converts the faxes to tiff format. I
then log in with my web browser and view or download the fax.  The
service runs ~$25/month.

I'm sure there are other ways, I just like the ones that use the

The local "A" cellular service (Wilcom Cellular, Youngstown/Warren OH)
offers fax mailboxes.  I don't have the literature in front of me, and
I've never tried it.

I believe you get a dedicated phone number, just like voice mail.  I
don't remember whether you call your own number, or a special "pick up"
number, to get your own faxes based on your mailbox number and a PIN.

You can pick up messages with a fax machine.  If the interface is
designed "right" there should be no difficulties using a fax modem.

We also have CT2 here in Singapore (Callzone) and the product is the
Motorola Silverlink too. The phone itself costs ~S$250 while the
personal base station (for home use as a cordless phone) costs ~S$300.
Calls are 20cents/min (double the cost of public phones but equivalent
to that of cellular phones). I'd like to have one but can't justify it
since you can actually get cell phones for about S$700. (currently
US$1 ~= S$1.5)

For what it's worth, Bell Atlantic has begun offering what amounts to
outgoing voice mail ("T-mail" or telephone mail) in Montgomery County,
Md.  (outside Washington, DC).  You can store up to three lists of 25
recipients and send a recorded message to one or more lists.  Charges
are usage-based, with no monthly charge during the test (I think charges 
are about 15 or 25 cents per message, with the lower charge if you
already have their voice mail service).

What is your definition of low cost?

I have been using a Proteon RBX-200 to handle connectivity to my house
since January.  It has 1 ether (AUI) and two WAN (V.35) ports on it
that can run up to T1 speeds.  You can find them for $1300 complete
with software and cables.  The full DOCs are extra at about $150.  You
can probably do a PPP or Proteon serial config without the DOCs, but
if you have any trouble, you'll need them.  The RBX-200 talks PPP,
Frame Relay, Proteon-custom serial, and a couple of others that I
don't remember right now.  And it also includes all the fancy routing
software.

I went with Proteon because the backorder on Cisco was insane.  It
seems that there are ALOT of telcos and ISPs out there recommending
the 2501.  It is priced in the same ballpark as the RBX-200.  But
Cisco unbundled the thing and its software to the Nth degree. I found 
no reasonable assistance in figuring out what I really needed to
order.  And those that claimed to carry the thing were all out of
stock with a nasty backlog.

*MY* problem has been finding reasonable prices on CSU/DSUs.  But some
telcos require you to use theirs anyway, so you might not need to buy
your own.

If you are REALLY into it, you can poke around a mailing list that I
am on looking for John Paul Morrison. He posted a note on 95-04-30
that included the following snipit:

John Paul Morrison's email address is jmorriso@bogomips.ee.ubc.ca.
The list I am on is crossgcc@prosun.first.gmd.de.  It is a forum of

Sure -- just get a low-end workstation and add a V.35 serial interface.

This is doable at 56K, but if you go much beyond that, don't expect
the box to be usable for much of anything else. Plus, if the workstation 
goes down, so does your network connection.

conveniently overlooking the companies brought to ground by similar
transactions, not to mention the social costs of those disasters.  He
also seems to feel that, left to themselves, the various banks and

money.  If he's so smart, where was he when it was happening?  I don't

I watched part of a press conference held by (I think) the Progress
and Freedom Foundation people on C-SPAN over the weekend.  Apparently,
once you buy, lease, or obtain the rights to a frequency or band, and
there is interference to you by someone else (as in CATV leaking over
into the aircraft band), you would have the right to prosecute the
offending party for tresspass.  Seems to me it would give the owners
of today's stations in the East U.S. to sue the owners of stations in
the Midwest or the West U.S. in the event of a band opening, or maybe
in the case of tropo ducting of some signals.  Did anyone else watch
any of this and get the same impression?


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: People who talk like that display a
woeful ignorance of how radio waves and radios in general operate. I
recall when the late Ayn Rand used to talk about how there should be
no governmental control of the airwaves and that everyone should be
allowed to do their own thing and 'let the most powerful transmitter
be the one that is heard ...'. She was ignorant about radios also. 
I don't care if you are pushing 50,000 watts; if I get up next to some
receiver with a hundred milliwatt transmitter I am going to jam your 
signal. I can right now, in the privacy of my home with the limited
stuff I have here prevent the neighbors on either side of me from watching 
Channel 2 on television ... or make it pretty miserable for them. So if
your signal comes into my home and I block it out am I 'trespassing' on
your property? All you people who favor private ownership of the airwaves
via auction or selling them to one another, etc, what I want you to do
is get *your property* out of my house. I am going to start charging you
a fee for allowing your property to remain in my house. 

While I certainly have complaints of my own with the FCC because of
some aspects of their operation -- their field investigators who used
to drive up and down the streets triangulating on CB'ers they did not
like years ago provided the example of 'jackboot thugs' all other federal
agencies including BATF could only hope to someday emulate -- I still
feel some technical regulation of the airwaves is essential. I don't 
think they have much business regulating content, but I think they have
done quite well with technical standards over the years.   PAT]

Jerry,

I don't know how a CD or regular tape player will do if it's left on all
the time.  You may run into more repair problems than it's worth.  

You might do better to get a digital music-on-hold player.  You play
the music you want from a cassette tape once and the player loads it
into its memory.  When you hear the music-on-hold it's being play from
the memory of the player, not a tape that's running all the time.  If
you want different music, you can load a different tape.  I think you
can find these players for around $500 or so.  I think Hello Direct
sells one as well as other catalogs.

Also, you might want to remember that legally you are supposed to pay a
music licensing fee to play CDs or tapes as your music-on-hold.  You might
want to contact BMI or ASCAP and get more information.  When you buy a
digital player, it usually comes with some generic licensed music.

If you want more information, you can E-Mail me directly.  I know more
about music-on-hold than I would like to.

3M is a big player in the (telco) outside plant business.  At one time
they almost owned the market for wire splices (Scotchloks), at least
for those not still clinging to the B wire connectors.  They still
make a lot of copper wire splices, splice enclosures, ecapsulants,
mechanical fiber optic splices, and electrical tape.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I guess it does not matter after so many
years and with their 'Scotch' trademark as well-known as it is, but I
was told that the slection of the term 'scotch' for their products long-
ago (when it was basically Scotch-Tape and a few similar items) was sort
of degrogatory. An old ethnic myth says that Scottish people are tight-
fisted and stingy with their money. The theory was that 3-M's tape was
inexpensive and very little of it would last a long time. i.e. a roll of
their tape would last you almost forever, and just cost a few cents to
purchase (in those days). Therefore you could be 'scottish' about spending
your money and 'scottish' in the amount of tape needed to put together
or repair whatever it was you were working on. If they wished to be
politically correct at all times -- like myself -- they would probably
rename their products. Imagine how awful it would sound for example if
they called it 'Jewish Tape' or something like that.   PAT]

I recently got the chance to visit the 911 Center for Monroe County,
New York.  (Monroe County includes Rochester, NY, home of Kodak,
Bausch and Lomb, and Paychex, among others.)  The county's new 911
center is certainly something to behold!  Among the details I remember, 
it is constructed with bulletproof glass and Kevlar-composite wall
panels, as well as being earthquake- and flood-proof and having its
own power supplies and redundant communications links.  The impression
that I got was that if there were ever an earthquake that flooded
town, cut off power, and caused people to start emptying their illegal
assault rifles into the comm center, 911 would be able to ignore it
and go on taking calls. :)

They also have specially-designed acoustic walls.  They deaden the sound
from the calltaker's workstations, so it's not noisy; but the supervisors
in the center of the room can still be heard clearly at each station,
and a standing operator can easily be heard by the supervisor.  The
acoustic properties of the room were amazing!

Anyhow, in Monroe County -all- 911 calls are routed to this center, unless
an outlying community fields its own landline 911 calls at its police
station.  This includes all cellular 911 calls made to towers within
Monroe County.  The one center has call takers and dispatchers for
police, fire, and ambulance, for local, county, and state forces.  They
also handle the occasional odd cellular traffic, like boaters on Lake
Ontario, and the soon to be documented on "Rescue 911" case of a small
plane pilot whose radio went out while on approach, who called 911 on
his cellphone from the plane to talk to the tower ...

The call-takers and dispatchers use a special call system running on
Digital PCs with touchscreens.  Besides the usual enhanced-911 capabilities,
they can easily hand off calls to local and state agencies with a quick
touch of one of their three video screens.  They can call up detailed
life-saving information on another screen to assist a caller.

The tour guide did mention the bane of their existance: the cellular phone.
The problem is that cellphones don't pass Caller-ID or ANI here in Monroe
County.  Therefore, the staff can't even determine your name and phone
number, never mind your location.

The things that the 911 tour guide mentioned regarding cell phones were:

* BEFORE you place the call to 911,
        - find out what road you're on.
        - find out what the nearest cross street, exit, or mile marker is.
        - PULL OFF THE ROAD! and don't make matters worse by juggling the
          handset.  (NY does not yet have a law requiring the use of a 
          handsfree microphone while the vehicle is in motion, but one
          is expected to pass and take effect real soon now.)
        - if you are calling because of an accident or an injury to
          another party, investigate the situation and assess the status
          of everyone else involved before calling.  If anyone is in
          immediate danger, help them before calling.
        - if the emergency involves a car anywhere near traffic, set out
          flares or triangles to warn oncoming traffic.  (You do have 
          flares in your car, right? :)

* When you call 911,
        - try to remember the calltaker's name in case you are cut off.
        - remember that they have no idea where you are or who you are.
        - give your name and your cellular telephone number.
        - state the nature of the emergency:
                - what happened?
                - is anyone injured?
                - is a crime in progress?
                - is a gun involved?  etc.
        - DO NOT hang up until you are told to do so.

If you're like me, you're probably thinking that most of this seems
pretty common-sense.  However, it was made excruciatingly clear during
the tour that most cellular 911 callers screw up most of this.  The
guide had a lot of contempt for people who call in and say "I just
passed a broken down car."

911:    Where are you?
Caller: On the highway.
911:    Which highway?
Caller: I don't know, I'm not from around here, the big highway.
911:    Do you know the mile marker or the nearest exit?
Caller: Geez, I wasn't paying attention, can't you send someone?
911:    Well, what kind of car was it?
Caller: It was a white car, I don't know what kind, it went by fast.
911:    Was anyone hurt?
Caller: I couldn't tell, I didn't stop...
911:    Do you know the license plate number of the car?
Caller: I told you, I didn't see!
[etc.]

That's something I made up, but it's the kind of thing the tour guide
described as being a fairly typical cellular 911 call, and the reason why
911 hates cellular. :)

I'd say, if you're trying to educate cellular users, the absolute best
thing you can do is write a short, simple, and to the point guide about
what to do in a cellular emergency.  It'd be good if it were small enough
to fold into a door pocket, the pocket of a bag phone, or even a wallet.

Basically, most cellular systems will allow "Follow-Me Roaming" when
out of area.  You dial *18 when you reach a new system (not a new cell
 -- a new system) and that tells the cellular network "I'm here!".
Then, they can route calls to you.

If you're driving, this generally translates into dialing *18 every 50
miles or so.  If your carrier covers a large area, or has agreements,
this may not even be necessary.  Bell Atlantic has a deal where
Automatic Call Delivery (no extra code required) works for Philly
customers all the way from NYC to Washington DC.

You also have to activate Follow-Me Roaming once per day, as it
automatically deactivates at midnight.  If you want to deactivate it
on your own, dial *19.

I've used it, and it works when I remember to activate it.

My thoughts exactly.

Few if any of the concerns addressed in this thread are addressed in
the "comprehensive plan" I summarized. Enforcement issues, treatment
of noncommercial licensees, unlicensed devices, and many other issues
are ignored, trivialized or dismissed.

Most of the plan deals with general and non-wireless issues and
historical review (or revision). I tried to pick out only the most
concrete proposals affecting radio communications and to paraphrase
them briefly. Anyone is welcome to ask pff@aol.com for a copy of the
plan, titled "The Telecom Revolution -- An American Opportunity."

I would urge anyone reading it to take it with a grain of salt.
Readers unfamiliar with the FCC proceedings described might be tempted
to believe the accounts as presented.

The downsized Executive Branch agency that would remain after the FCC
is eliminated would retain some duties, many of these for a limited
time.  International coordination of allocations and orbit assignments
and representing the U.S. in international fora, for example, would be
retained for three years and then subject to review.

Such functions, however, as technical standards for equipment and
services, authority to assign bands of frequencies to various
stations, and many other fundamental functions would be repealed,
period.

I work for a company which manufacturers the equipment for setting up
fax mailboxes.  In general, our equipment is used by service providers
to offer general store and forward fax service.

Our equipment allows people to sign up for something we call Direct
Access to Mailbox.  Under this arrangement, you are given a special
phone number which your correspondents use to send faxes to you.
These faxes are received and stored on a fax mailbox on one of our
machines.  At anytime you want, you call up your subscriber service
number and request that your faxes be sent to you.  You hang up the
phone and pretty soon all of the stored faxes are faxed to you.  It
doesn't matter whether you have a PC or fax machine.  There are may
different ways of using the service depending upon the facilities
offered by your phone company.  Our equipment allows you to forward
any stored faxes to any destination you desire.  This is especially
handy if you travel a lot and want to be able to retrieve your faxes
no matter where you are.

For example, you can give your correspondents your normal fax number.
If the the line is available when they call, their faxes will end up
at your site.  However, you can forward your phone to the service
number if your line on busy or if you feel like turning off your PC.
Another option is to give your correspondents the service number but
put the mailbox in autoforward mode.  Any faxes coming into the
mailbox, will automatically be forwarded to your normal fax number.
If it is unavailable, they will be left in the mailbox for later
manual retrieval.

I am sure that AT&T, the Baby Bells etc. offer these kinds of
services.  Unfortunately they do not use our equipment.  Our equipment
is used throughout the world by other countries such as Korea,
England, Denmark, etc.  Somethimes, you may find service providers
with fax mailbox offerings who cater to high volume corporate
accounts.

I hope that this helps.  I'm sorry I can't be more specific about
seeking service providers.  If you lived in Denmark, I could give you
a number and user's manual.

Call Delrina at 1-800-268-6082.

They have exactly such a service which gives you fax mailboxes on a
1-800 telephone number.  About $9.95/mo gives you a fixed number of
pages of fax and so many cents per page after that.

Paging notification and voicemail are also options.

Subject: History of TSPS/TOPS/OSPS
Date: Thu, 08 Jun 95 09:24:00 GMT


When 1984 (so appropo' considering Orwell's year) came around, TSPS
operators who had previously been employees of the local Bell Op.Co's
were then employees of the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. (AT&T
Long Lines became AT&T Communications, too).

I'm not quite sure about the larger Indeps (GTE, etc) who had their
OWN toll switches and operator centers.  Some Indeps had TSPS (a
Western Electric standard) but the Indeps had GTE-Automatic Electric
manufacture TSPS.

Canada was PRIMARLIY TOPS (Traffic Operator Positions Systems), which
Northern Electric (Telecom) developed in the 1970's.  This was MORE
DIGITAL than TSPS and usually homed on a DMS switch.  Many Indie's in
the US also used TOPS.  The terminals were just like a computer
terminal and NOT designed like a TSPS board.  There is a video monitor
and a keyboard (alphanumeric).  However, the OPERATOR FUNCTIONS (KP,
KP card, KP back, POS-REL, T&C, INTL, etc.etc.etc.) were ALSO labelled
on the alphanumeric keys (along with the regular letters & numbers).

Sometime around 1986, AT&T here in Louisiana began adding video
monitors and keyboards to their TSPS positions.  This were a SEPARATE
operation, to search a database for NamePlace (NPA-NXX), Rate & Route,
Rates, Operator Codes, Numberings, etc.  They were NOT directly tied
in with the traditional TSPS.  Around Christmas 1986, local TV showed
how AT&T's operators were busy handling Holiday calling volume, and
you saw the traditional TSPS board along with the video monitor
suspended on a pole from the ceiling and the keyboard sitting on top
of the flat shelf directly in front of the operator.

One of the MFJ stipulations was that the local BOC's were going to
'take-back' operator services for local/inTRA-LATA calls.  The CBS
Evening News one nite in 1985 showed Seattle (Pac.NW Bell/USWest) with
the differences between 0 (InTRA-Lata Bell) and 00 (InTER-Lata via
AT&T or whatever carrier).  AT&T was still using TSPS while the local
Bells were unanimously going to NT's TOPS equipment.  Louisiana had
Bell taking back the '0' (for InTRA-Lata) in the Spring of 1986.  The
SCBell Operator could always transfer you over to AT&T, but AT&T
cannot transfer you back to Bell.  (Today, SCBell can also try to
transfer you over to MCI and Sprint and probably others, at the
customer's request).  From 1986 to 1989, AT&T could ALSO complete
calls within the LATA at the Bell Tarriffed rates, and Bell got all of
the revenue.

Around 1989/90, AT&T began to introduce OSPS (Operator Service
Positions Systems), a Western Electric manufacture, DIGITAL,
associated with #5ESS.  AT&T operators would NOT assist on InTRA-LATA
calls (unless tarriffed by the local body to do so).  You could NOT
place a 'sequence call' on your calling card within the LATA if the
original call was InTER-Lata via AT&T.  OSPS 'boards' look very much
like TOPS- a monitor and keyboard.

In September, 1991, the Louisiana PSC 'permitted' InTRA-LATA
competition.  Why I put this in quotes is that MCI, Sprint, etc.
ALWAYS completed InTRA-LATA calls when placed with fg.A or B access
using 950-XXXX or 1-800- numbers.  AT&T had ALWAYS respected Bell's
revenue/territory and since AT&T did not get any revenue on InTRA-LATA
calls but their operators were doing work, they discontinued
InTRA-LATA when they implemented OSPS. When InTRA-LATA competion was
then allowed, AT&T started completing calls again, and here in
Louisiana, their per-minute toll rates ARE NOTICEABLY LESS than Bell
(except on weekends/nites, where Bell is a penny cheaper per minute
than AT&T).

SHORTER DISTANCE Intralata (toll) points are OPTIONALLY available as an 
extended monthly package plan - similar to measured/metered rate and even 
some of these points are 'capped' as if it were monthly flat rate.  AT&T 
handled (such as calling card) calls which are in the TRADITIONAL LOCAL 
CALLING AREA are timed rate - Bell's card and opr.asstd.local rates are FLAT 
here in Louisiana - approx.88cents (63cent opr.assistance surcharge even 
tho' it can be fully automated, plus the quarter you WOULD have dropped in 
the payphone).  If you have several calls, mixed inTER-Lata, InTRA-LATA 
TOLL, and LOCAL to all be billed on a calling card, you should try to 
determine the rates BEFOREHAND, and probably NOT want to do a simple string 
of 'Sequence Calls'.

I'm NOT getting into private payphone situations in the above - we
know that they do NOT conform to traditional Bell System standards.

A FEW MORE POINTS - when you were connected to a TSPS operator, both
the caller AND the operator heard a 'zip' tone beep for a split second
- you do NOT hear that when the OSPS or TOPS operator answers - AND -
AT&T has been doing MAJOR consolidation of their Operator centers (the
Bells have done some too) - When I dial 00 from New Orleans, I started
to get TSPS or OSPS operators in Jackson MS or Memphis TN in 1989/90.
TODAY, I get AT&T operators in Atlanta, Florida, the Carolinas, and
Virginia (yes, I ask them where they are located), a different time
zone than mine, and if the OSPS opr.doesn't check our times, she HAS
quoted me the wrong rates such as when I have 7am and she has 8am - of
course, I know what the rates are approximatly and I usually say
'check-again ... I'm in the CENTRAL time zone'.

ALSO, when one dials (10(10)288)+00 (or AT&T's 800 access) today, you
first get the jingle and logo, followed by a recorded 'If you'd like
to place a call, please enter the Area Code and number now - If you
need Operator assistance, please say OPERATOR now' to which you can
also touch(DTMF) 0 or 0# or 00, to which you hear 'Please hold for an
operator'.  AS THE OPERATOR COMES ON THE LINE, most of the time, a
standard recording (usually female) states 'AT&T-How may I help you?'.
They do have a standard MALE recording, but sometimes the female voice
recording states the above, with a MALE operator on the line.
Sometimes the recording does NOT come in and the operator answers
LIVE.  I HATE THAT RECORDING and the waits and prompts - When I dial
00, I want to talk to a LIVE OPERATOR.  If I am making an automated
tupe of billed call, I will dial (10288)+0+ (and other code strings)

Does anyone know if the earliest issues (before May, 1981) of the
HumanNets Mailing list have been archived and are available anywhere?

I have come across posts or digests from the 1981 - 1983 period, but
wondered if the earlier posts have been saved.

It seemed to be an important and popular Mailing List on the ARPANET
and also was of great interest to Usenet pioneers when they were able
to have a gateway to the ARPANET Mailing Lists like HumanNets and
Scifi lovers.

Also, I am interested in knowing more about how it started and 
how it came to be called HumanNets.

The early posts I have read indicate that folks on it were interested
in exploring what Human Nets connected by computers would make possible.

I wondered if anyone had any of the early posts that described the
vision of a WorldNet that folks discussed in the early 1980's.

I am working on a draft article about early Usenet and it would be
helpful to have more background on both the vision of WorldNet and 
how Usenet fit into that.

this Digest, with a few exceptions, have been archived for interested
parties, but I don't know about anything from the late 1970's or 1980.

If anyone knows the answer to this, it might be some of the charter
subscribers to this Digest. Yes, there are a half-dozen or so of the
people who were on the list in 1981 who are still on it today. Perhaps
they know something about it. 

Just as this Digest came from Human Nets, other e-zines have had their
origin here in telecom. The Computer Privacy Digest was started by
Dennis Rears as a result of a large volume of messages on Caller-ID 
that I did not want to handle here. He has since passed the Digest on
to the professor in Milwaukee. Then Computer Underground Digest, or CuD
was 'born' here under much the same circumstances: a net scandal several
years ago involving a couple of (at the time) well-known net people
which resulted in prison sentences also resulted in a massive overflow
of mail and a great deal of controversy in this Digest and elsewhere on
the net. CuD started as a result, to continue that discussion. Bill
Pfieffer began his Airwaves Radio Journal with my assistance, although
not as a direct offspring from telecom.   PAT]

I certainly hope not.  The last thing I want to see in this newsgroup

Subject: Johnny Mnemonic - Waste of Time, Money


As I mentioned here Thursday afternoon, I went to see the movie Johnny
Mnemonic at the Old Orchard Theatre. I had to rush over there in time
for the 5:30 pm show, stopping at the cash station to get money for a
ticket, my popcorn, etc. The popcorn and soft drink cost almost as much
as the ticket. ($7 for ticket; $6.25 for huge box of popcorn and large
Coke, and that was with a one dollar off coupon for refreshments they
gave me when I went in.)

Well, such a waste of my time and money. The movie lasted about ninety
minutes and by 7:30 pm I was back home again. 

I *thought* it was going to have something more to do with the 'net'
in a realistic way, but this movie was nothing but violence and sheer
fantasy, taking place in the year 2050, or somewhere around that time.
Throughout the whole movie there are people fighting, killing each 
other, chopping off each other's arms and heads, etc. They start fires,
set off bombs, etc. For quite a few of the characters in the movie their
vocabulary is limited to mostly four letter words.

This fellow Johnny is engaged as a courier between people on one side
and people on the other.  He travels between Bejing and a place known
as 'Free Newark'. He has chips implanted in his head which hold 'data'
to be conveyed from one side to the other. He goes to the one side where
a massive amount of 'data' is uploaded into his brain and then goes to
the other side to have it downloaded. He literally plugs some wire in
the back of his head at one end where they upload to him, then the
same thing is supposed to happen in reverse on the other end.

Well, it turns out the people on both sides are pretty nasty. After
the people on one side upload to him he barely escapes with his life
to get to the other side. Naturally he has to kill or maim at least
a dozen people by that point. When he gets back, the people on the
other side renege on their deal to pay him and restore his brain to
its normal operation. To make matters worse, no one can seem to find
the password needed to commence the download, so a decision is reached
that it will be necessary to chop off his head, then use brute force
to extract his brain from his severed head and pick the data out 
byte by byte. 

Well Johnny does not like that idea at all, and a few dozen more 
people wind up either dead or set on fire. Johnny does all this
singlehandedly of course except for when his obligatory girl friend
assists him with dispatching a couple of the bad guys. You always
have to have a girl friend in these movies, someone with enough
intelligence to think of some last minute rescue tactics. She gets
Johnny hustled off to this place where the good guys are going to
let him 'hook into the net' so the download can take place. By now
Johnny is getting some awful headaches from the information overload
he has been carrying around for a couple days and we are told he will
die unless the data can be downloaded to the 'net' immediatly.

Trouble is, they still cannot remember the password needed so a hacker
in the form of a fish in a large aquarium tank (yes, that's what I
said; it is unclear to me how exactly the hacker got that way) is
called upon to find the password using brute force if needed. Even
the hacker fails at his task. Now everyone feels certain the only
thing left to do is chop off Johnny's head so the data can be saved.
In fact, complain the good guys, because of the information overload
in his head, there has already been some 'leakage' and most likely
the data is corrupted.  They convince Johnny that since he 'is going
to die anyway' if they don't manage to download the data very soon,
he might as well go along with their plan to try a lobotomy first in
the hopes the data can be saved without killing Johnny completely in
the process.

Well wouldn't you know it, at the very last minute, someone comes up
with a scrap of paper where the password had been written down and
all turns out well. Johnny gets plugged into the 'net' through this
connection on the back of his head, and the good guys announce that
the download will commence. He doesn't have to have a hole drilled
in his head -- or worse yet, his head cut off -- and of course there
is the obligatory scene with his girl friend at the end where they
are kissing, smiling and happy.

I think over the course of this ninety minute talking/motion picture,
there were about sixty different people who were killed or seriously
wounded either by being shot, stabbed, chopped up, set on fire or
by being in a place that was bombed or set on fire, etc. We got to
see how a 'sound cannon' works, and how if a person cannot get away
in time it causes blood to squirt out of their eyes, nose and ears,
a lot like the desease Ebola. 

Before this spectacle started, we were treated to a preview of coming
attractions, and another major motion picture of this same genre 
called 'Internet - 2051', which will soon be Coming to a Theatre
Near You. It appeared to be just as trashy and crude as Johnny Mnemonic,
although it might be worse since for the preview of coming attractions
they have to cut out all the sex and profanity.

So now, not only do we have an endless supply of newspaper editors and
reporters who make up *lies* about the internet, it looks like Hollywood 
has discovered us also.

The popcorn wasn't that good either.

Subject: Now Four Local Players in Chicago
Date: Fri, 09 Jun 1995 08:00:00 CDT


LCI International, the nation's sixth largest long distance company has
filed an application with the Illinois Commerce Commission to offer local
phone service in Chicago. 

Based in McLean, Virginia, LCI now joins AT&T and MCI Metro (a division of
MCI Telecommunications) in competing with Ameritech for customers in the
Chicago area.

What makes this particularly interesting is that LCI is specifically 
aiming for the residential market. In the past, competitors to the 'phone
company' seemed to always be interested in the business market, and in
particular the largest of the business customers. 

LCI has promised to make a vigorous attack on Ameritech's residential
customer base with flat long distance rates and six second billing. Their
application is under review now by the Illinois Commerce Commission and
some decision is expected later this summer.

Does any other community have four companies interested in local service?
Does any other community have a long distance telco with a specific interest
in agressively signing up the residential customers?

They'll be doing it, they say, by purchasing space and resources in bulk
through Ameritech for resale.  It should be an interesting summer.

It would appear that by drawing loop current from one side of each
line circuit, you placed two simultaneous calls, and therefore got two
responses.  The type of equipment providing the local service
certainly has an affect on whether or not such a situation would
result in two calls (or even one), but how the calls are routed
through the network after the local switch should be immaterial.

Hope this helps.

I got a business tonight and got stuck in "phone mail jail".  I wanted
to leave a message, but the option didn't work and I kept looping.
There was no way to reach a human.

Also frustrating are automated PBX systems.  Suppose I know neither a
person nor extension number?  I need an operator to connect me to the
accounting department.  In the old days, a company's switchboard
operator was trained in the company, and knew whether to connect to
general accounting, accounts-payable, accounts receiving, payroll,
etc., as set up by that company.  This was known as good business, and
strongly encouraged in PBX training by the Bell System.

I wish that phone mail system manufacturers would help their customers
design decent, standardized, easy-to-use, and fail-safe systems.  The
stuff out now stinks.

First, a lot of customers still have rotary dials.  Given voice
recognition technology, it should be a no-brainer to pick up dial
pulses (if they can decipher voice, they can decipher precisely timed
clicks).

Second, there should be ALWAYS an exit to a human operator, and without
waiting six hours for one.  Pressing 0 should instantly switch to a human.
If the company is closed, there should be a recording option.

Third, systems should try to use standardized key functions.  * and #
should do the same thing.  If you have recording or transfer options,
the keys should be uniform across systems.  It would save so much time.

Lastly, systems should be carefully designed so that no customer ends up
in an infinite loop, or phone mail jail.

BTW, Ted Koppel did a story on this on ABC's Nightline.  Not a good item
for the Telecommunications product industry.

Subject: Information Wanted About Smart Cards
From: DPAYNE@vichosp.london.on.ca (DAVID PAYNE)
Date: 08 Jun 95 22:50:55 EDT


Pat,

Does anyone know of some resources that are available on smart card
technology?  I work for a hospital in London, Ontario that is looking
into different multi functional smart card applications.  Are there
any hospitals in North America or Europe that are using this technology?  
Does anyone know of some people I could talk to or articles I could
read?  What about books?

The hospital would like to explore implementing a multifunctional smart 
card for the hospital staff.  The application that is being explored is 
to provide one card that serves as a parking card, staff ID card, a long 
distance debit/calling card, and a debit card for cafeteria food.  Is 
this possible and affordable today?  Ideally, we would like the card to 
access payroll or the hospital credit union's bank accounts.

We understand that debit technology will often increase sales for a 
vendor by as much as 20%.  Has anyone ever heard this and if so does 
anyone know of any research that has been published on the benefits of 
this technology?

I will share my results with this group!

Thanks again!

Northwestern University. They have something called the 'Wild Card' which
can be used in all the vending machines, copy machines and such around
the campus. You purchase it in the book store there, and when it runs out
you can load it up again at machines where you insert the card, then put
in money -- up to twenty dollars I think -- and retrieve your card with 
the new value stored on it. You might ask Northwestern about it.  PAT]

Subject: Merging Phone Company Test Boards


I am interested in hearing some stories or experiences from those who 
worked in the residential repair (particularily test board) for phone 
companies that merged various test centres together to create a 'super 
test centre'.

Our test centre started on the old #14 test boards and about ten years
ago migrated up to CALRS.

The test centre originally looked after just one city, then took over
a few others and eventually the entire areacode.  Now, it is proposed
that it be merged with four other test centres to create a large
centre that covers several reasonably large areacodes.

I was told New England Tel did this as did some others, and we are
curious to hear your comments on how well it went ... did customer
service benefit or suffer?  How well were you able to handle all the
different (and large number of) switches and all the new various types
of customers and environments they were in (IE Big cities, to small
four party service).  It could mean several people have to move to a
new city to continue their current job.

Any thoughts you have to offer on this topic are appreciated.

I have a pretty basic question. When you place a call from a cellular phone 
does the cellular company record which cell(s) actually handled the call? I 
know they could if they wanted to, but do they?

In something like the Simpson case it might be interesting if it turned out 
that his ex-wife's house was in a different cell from his house.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: That Simpson trial is the biggest travesty
of justice I have ever seen. Who wants to bet with me that it will last
at least until the end of this year, and probably well into 1996?  Who
agrees with me that there will probably be a mistrial as a result of all
the jury commotions and it will have to be started over from the beginning
and last another year after that?  To answer your question, yes I think
sometimes they do keep a record of the cells involved in a call when they
have reason to need or want that information.   PAT]

Thanks for the interesting story about TSPS.
 
Actually, TSPS stands for Traffic Service Position System.  According
to the glossary in ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS IN THE BELL SYSTEM (my
copy is the 1982 Seventh Printing, copyright 1977 by Bell Labs) TSPS
means:
 
"That type of Traffic Service System, having stored program control,
that provides for the processing and recording of special toll calls,
coin station toll calls, and other types of calls requiring operator
assistance.  It includes traffic service positions arranged in groups
called traffic offices where operators are automatically connected in
on calls to perform functions necessary to process and record calls
correctly."

Hi Pat,

I say this waste of money a couple weeks back.  I could have told you to
save your money. :-)

You're right that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Internet.  The
Internet is still nebulous and unknown enough that movie makers can do
whatever they want to with it.  Heck, witness Seaquest's "Innernet," which
is a direct rip-off of what sci-fi authors would like the Internet to be.

Some remarks about Johnny M ...

-- It was obvious to me from the start that Johnny's data had to connected
with the plague.  Why else would it exist?

-- I was disappointed that the cause of the sickness was never really given
other than "all this technology."  Yeah, right, what in the world does that
mean?  We should all go back and live in caves?

-- The plan is to disseminate Johnny's information as widely as possible,
right?  So why not just duplicate the cute little disc that's uploaded to
Johnny's brain a thousand times and send it to all the newspapers?  Oh,
because we wouldn't have a story then.  Oops.

-- How does Johnny ever get his childhood memories back (wasn't than an
ironic twist...)?  The company has them -- not the dolphin!  Heck, I'd
demand a copy of my memories on disc before I even became a courier. :-)

$7 for a 5:30 show!?  I hate to think what they charge for the non-matinee
shows!

Yes, it was excessive, but is it any worse than, e.g., True Lies or Rambo?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: No, it was no worse that those other two 
farces you named, but I did not like those and did not go to see them
in the first place. I was not tricked into thinking that they had something
to do with the internet. I got there thirty minutes too late for the price
change from matinee to evening. They have a very low price -- about two
dollars -- from when they first open at 9:00 AM until early afternoon,
then the matinee price, then finally the evening prices. There were quite
a few things left unexplained in the movie. How the hacker-fish came to
have all those childhood memories he reloaded into Johnny's brain was a 
mystery to me also.  PAT]

Why? In the old car hobby a common saying is "steel does not last long
but rust is forever". In general oxides are very stable. Can still
play my reel- reel Scotch tapes made in the 60's, the oxide is fine
but the acetate is becoming quite brittle -- couldn't afford the mylar
often then.

BTW the "Post-It" notes from 3M are also said to have been an
accident. In looking for an adhesive, a researcher came across a
not-very-good adhesive and a whole new industry was born.

Also, as a Douglas, I do not find the term "Scotch Tape" to be
derrogatory even if they do have red in the tartan. "Scot's Tape"
might have been but "Scotch" refers to whisky and is never out of
order.


Warmly,

Subject: AT&T Reaches Labor Agreement


AT&T REACHES TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT WITH TWO UNIONS

By STEVE GEIMANN
Senior Editor, Communications Daily

   WASHINGTON -- AT&T and its two labor unions, the CWA and IBEW,
reached tentative agreement Friday on a three-year contract with 10.5
percent in pay raises, $3,400 in cash-stock bonuses, incentives to
join a managed health care plan and improved relations in future
organizing.

   The agreement covers 101,000 AT&T workers at the national level,
while local units have one week to wrap up bargaining on local issues
within the next week.  Ratification will begin when local talks end
and will take several weeks.  AT&T employees have been working without
a contract since May 27.

   Both sides said agreement is in best interests of company and union
members.  CWA represents 81,000; IBEW covers 20,000.

   Employees will get $1,000 bonus upon ratification, $800 in AT&T
stock annually through 1998 and wage increases of 3.6 percent
immediately, 3.5 percent next year and 3.4 percent in 1987.  When
compounded, the effect is 10.8 percent.

  "We made substantial improvement in the areas of wages, health care,
pension benefits, employment security and training and education for
our members," said CWA President Morton Bahr.  Retiree health care was
"protected" against out of pocket payments former employees got three
options for coverage.

   IBEW President John Barry said "hard bargaining" led to a "fair
agreement" that provides a "good economic base" for members and sets
foundation for "true cooperative effort between AT&T and the unions to
stop job losses and ensure more opportunities for its existing work
force."

   Company officials held a late night news briefing in Washington to
outline the tentative agreement, agreeing talks were difficult b but
produced satisfactory agreement for the company.

   "Overall, these talks have been the most objective and focused
labor negotiations in our recent history," said William Ketchum, vice
president-labor relations.

  On key issue of health care, agreement includes new managed care
network starting in January that provides coverage without deductibles
or coinsurance costs, but requires flat fees for doctor visits,
prescription drugs and some hospital stays. Coverage would extend to
prenatal and well-baby care, immunizations, routine physical exams and
hospice care, along with costs for preventative care, such as
mammograms, company said.

   Retirees could elect coverage in managed networks, beginning in
1997, by having some costs paid from a fund created for each retiree.
They would have two options: Plan without deductibles and coinsurance
charges and low flat fees, with monthly cost of $5 to $20.  Or, second
option with same coverage, no monthly payment, but higher co-payments
for doctor visits and hospital stays.

   Retirees since March 1990 also have option to remain outside
managed care network, company said.

   AT&T said retirees would receive a company-paid care account of
about $250 annually that would be used to cover monthly payments for
health care and other expenses, such as hearing exams and prescription
drug co-payments.

   On financial issues, the 401(k) saving plan would be expanded to
include additional investment options, more frequent statements and
cash balance updates, and speedier loan processing.  Employees could
but AT&T stock at 15 percent discount by shifting up to 10 percent of
their salaries, with company paying any commissions.

   Employees would get $800 in the first quarters of 1996, '97 and '98
which will be converted into stock at a price pegged to average during
week of Aug. 28, 1995, or the current price, whichever is lower.
Stock payments also were part of the just-expired contract.

  Other key elements:

  --Company would provide $7.5 million to a Family Care Development
Fund to improve the quality of senior and day care options, added to
$15 million contributed in the last three years.  Adoption expense
reimbursement would jump to $3,000 from $2,500.

  -- Employees could take one-third of their five excused work day in
two-hour segments, to handle family emergencies or other business
without taking a full day.

  --College scholarship program would be expanded to 70 awards of
$6,500 for each of a student's four-year college career.  Under the
program begun in 1992, 40 scholarships of $10,000 per year were
provided.

 -- A new "living benefits insurance option" would allow terminally
ill employees and retirees under age 64 to secure up to 50 percent of
their death benefits when they have less than six months to live.

  --Pension will increase 12 percent and for first time minimum
pension benefit was raised, to $400 a month, which will boost benefits
for more than 5,00 longer term pensioners, union said.

 --Employee transfer program was improved to give employees facing
plant shutdown or layoff better access to available jobs.

  -- Expands "Workplace of the Future" concept, which allows parties
to sit down and discuss key issues outside of normal contract
bargaining.  "Both the unions and management believe that success in
the marketplace is the only way to create real job security and help
people have productive and challenging careers," Ketchum said.

    Ketchum said agreement also spells out management and union "code
of conduct" during organizing efforts at three non-union AT&T
businesses: AT&T Universal Card, AT&T Transtech and AT&T Paradyne.
"There will be a more fact-based approach" by management when
unionization efforts are underway, Ketchum said.  Union said company
won't hire union consultants in campaign.

  A union dues deduction progress will be established at Global
Information Solutions union, formerly NCR, the first time such a
check-off system has been extended to unorganized unit within the
company, the unions said.

  Talks bogged down shortly after expiration of last agreement on May
27, with both sides spending more than three days trying to resolve
the health care issue.  Ketchum said company misjudged the complexity
of the health issue before bargaining began.

  "We underestimated how much time it would take to work through the
details and intricacies of reshaping our employee health care plan,"
Ketchum said.  Each detail had to have agreement from 12 people
sitting around bargaining table, he said.

   Talks opened April 3 and continued past expiration, with 10- to
14-hour bargaining sessions daily through last week.  Bahr and Ketchum
held talks earlier this week to move negotiators off certain issues
and move toward settlement.  Earlier Friday, both sides announced
likely tentative agreement had been reached.

Subject: Re: Mike Milken and George Gilder


Milken's critics all imply that they know the facts, when they are
instead parroting all the slanderous fictions prevalent in the media
during the late 1980s, in turn amplifying the innuendos and leaks from
government prosecutors who assumed that anyone making as much money as
Milken must be stealing.  My article showed that the total gains from
the merger and acquisition movement spearheaded by Milken and Drexel's
junk bonds totalled $899 billion.  This is net gains and includes all
the failures (few of which were Milken's).  Very few S&Ls bought any
junk at all (less than one percent of S&L holdings were junk) but the
few that did buy junk were among the most prosperous of all S&Ls.  

If the government did not pass laws forcing them to sell their
holdings into a falling market, they would indeed have made hundreds
of millions on their portfolios.  There were some shysters and crooks
involved in 1980s deals.  But Milken wasn't one of them. He was forced
to settle with the government when they threatened RICO suits against
his younger brother just brought into the company and against his
firm.  The fact that Milken could not resist this full court press
against him, despite his millions, merely illustrates the tremendous
power of prosecutors pursuing political eminence. Milken's nemesis
rode Boesky's lies into the New York City mayoralty, while later
investigations by the courts showed that the total cost of Milken's
violations was some $316K and that at least two of his confessed
offenses involved no criminal activity at all.

I thought Gilder's article was fascinating, and very thought-provoking.  
Dismissing it in a couple of sentences, without research or evidence,
is just not there.

*I* remember quite a *lot* of screaming and hollering, at the time, that 
if the feds would just leave the S&L's alone, they would recover nicely. 
Many heated articles and letters in the financial press ( I mostly read 
"Forbes" at that time) said over and over, that the crisis was created by 
the regulators and the press, not by the institutions. This was drowned 
out in the witch-hunt for somebody to blame the economic crisis on.

This doesn't take a whole lot of thought, you know. Today, Barnes & 
Noble/Bookstop, and MCI, look like the bluest of blue-chip investments. 
Then, they looked like the bleeding-edge of high flyers. Milken did that. 
And a S&L that had a lot invested in their junk-bonds would be a very 
rich S&L today.

Well, MY take on it was that Gilder was illustrating that the 
leverage on the money raised for expansion permitted a whole lot 
of growth without the same tax [and some other] burdens that more
"conventional" [quotes to emphasize my sarcastic slur on the "old"
money that really doesn't like TCI, MCI etc...] utilities and other
bluechips have to endure.  I don't recall reading any endorsement of
S&L fraud.  Listen to the "Holders Of Obsolescent Capital" whine.

World Wide Web, variously abbreviated as Web, WWW or W3, is the name
for the comprehensive and interlocking system of computers, networks,
daemons, languages, browsers, servers, protocols, clients and
documents.  HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the standard for
requests from Web clients (or browsers) and data from Web servers (or
sites or daemons).  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the formatting
code that specifies the display and functions of Web documents (or
files).  A Web browser is the program that runs (relatively) locally
and which is your interface to the W3.  And a Web site is that
combination of computer hardware, network links, daemon software, and
HTML files which you need in order to provide information to the World
Wide Web.
 
I was going to define client and server, too, but, believe me, W3 is
*not* the example to use if you want to portray a clear understanding
of client/server.  Oh, you think so, eh?  Then, which is the server,
the program that fulfills the data request, or the one that fulfills
the display request?  Or, if you're using SlipKnot, which of httpd,
lynx and SlipKnot is the client and which the server?
 
At any rate, you had better keep the definitions in the first
paragraph clear in your mind if you are going to use this book.  It
does provide an overview of the entire system, but it doesn't provide
an awful lot of information about any one topic.  After reading the
book you may still not, for example, be completely comfortable with
setting up an Internet router or firewall.  You will know basic HTML,
but not all the functions, by any means.  Examples for forms and
applications use Perl scripts, but Perl, itself, is not discussed.
 
The CD included with the book contains a very comprehensive and useful
set of tools, clients, utilities and references.  Programs for Windows
include such sought-after items as WIN32S; Trumpet Winsock; Lynx;
Perl; SlipKnot; HTML editors and assistants; viewers; email, news,
Gopher and IRC clients; and Netmanage's Chameleon.  There are DOS and
UNIX applications, as well as Internet FYI, RFC and STD reference
files.

Subject: Phone Monopolies in Europe
Date: 11 Jun 1995 15:06:20 GMT
Organization: Technical University of Berlin, Germany


After reading about phone monopolies in TELECOM Digest for some time,
it would be interesting to hear what Americans think of the European
way of "monophoning". 

As a Norwegian living in Germany, I beleive and suppose I have both
used and "felt" the two extremes in the world of West-European
monopolies.  Here in Germany, we have the highest phone-rates in
Europe (subjective opinion, which likely is fals :), local calls are
not that expensive, but calling further than 50 kms (about 30 miles)
places your call in the "Weit-Tarif" or "Far-tariffe" if one could
call it that. Daytime, these calls cost 66 pfenning or about 47
cents/minute. Calls to neighbouring countries or countries within the
European Union cost 82 cents/minute, calls to other countries in
Europe cost 92 cents/minute, calls to USA and Canada cost $1.40/minute
and calls to other countries world-wide cost $2.23/minute (all with an
exchange rate 1US$=1.40DEM).  

Calls to cellular-phones are charged 82 cents/minute from a regular
phone. Calls from cellulars to cellulars and cellulars to regular
phone are charged very different tarrifes depending on operator,
day-time and type of agreement. Now when you all are starting to feel
sorry for me, having to cope with all this, I could continue telling
that it took Deutsche Telekom AG (German ...) ten weeks to install a
phone-line in my appartment, and that after a really nasty letter
where I told them excatly what I meant (not suitable for quoting
here).  At the time of installation (early November 1994) I had
already noted, that they had misspelled my name, and called DT to tell
them that, and ask them to correct it. But, alas, such an important
matter, had to be reported in writing to a completely new adress. So I
did, and my name was for the first time correct on the bill for March
this year (with monthly bills).  

Yesterday I got a new copy of the local phonebook, and as of March
1995, they had managed to misspell my name in the phonebook.  What a
wonderful life. I would welcome all foreign providers to offer
competing services as the monopoly-rights will be withdraw from 1 January,
1998.

Now to Norway. To get my point here right, I guess some facts of
Norway and Germany have to be laid on the table. Germany has about
90 million inhabitants, and an area of 700 000 squarekm, which should
be about 270 000 square miles, if it's normal to meassure land in
such units. Norway has 4 million inhabitants and an area of 350 000
squarekms/140 000 square miles. With some dividing and multiplication,
I find out that the population-density in Germany is about ten times
higher than in Norway, and with some more reasonable thinking, I
would assume, that running a telecom in Germany would be much cheaper
for the customers than in Norway. 

But, I'm wrong. Norwegian Telecom provides one of the cheapest
services in Europe, although it has perhaps the most "difficult"
market to serve. Long distance calls cost in Norway (again more than
30 miles) 11 cents/minute, calls to neighbouring countries cost 35
cents/minute, calls to Western Europe cost 65 cents/minute and calls
to Eastern Europe, USA, Canada and Australia cost 72 cents/ minute
(with an exchange-rate of 1US$=6.50 NOK). Calls to cellulars cost 55
cents/minute. Now you have probably right if you claim these rates to
be far higher to what you can find in the US, and proving that one
monopoly is cheaper than an other, doesn't make theese clamps right.
Well, might be correct, but services from Telenor (Norwegian Telecom)
are excellent. If a physical line is already present in the appartment
you would like to have a phone, the line is normally conncected and
running within hours, all to wait for is a credit check. After buying
my cellular in Norway, it was up and running before I got home after
registering it, and most (covering 95% of the lines) exchanges are
digital, and connected with each other with digital fiber-links,
providing excellent speach-quality.  

In Germany (also the former West) analogue trunks with dead lines,
switching problems and cross-talk are still the reality for many
phoners, and with lines making even 9600 bps-calls difficult, one
should wonder how the government can keep the monopoly on telecom-
services. But again, back to Norway. Norway has a pop.density of 30
inhabitants/square-inch and most live along the coast in more or less
larger cities. That means, that in the inland, and northern parts, you
can drive a few hours between each small group of houses.  Still these
people can enjoy the same services provided from Telenor to people in
the larger cities like Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen. What would happen
if the Norwegian telecom-monopoly is withdrawn, and other providers
would start competing for the money.  Would they use a lot of money
and time to cover the less populatet areas of Norway, or would they
smash down in the denser areas? And what would happen if Telenor,
which actually is obligated to do so, was left as the only company
serving the areas of Norway where noone or only a few people live, and
they loose a lot of income from the other parts, would Telenor then be
able to provide such cheap services? I don't think so, and I guess a
lot of people agree on this.  The Norwegian parliament (Stortinget) is
at the moment discussing if they shall withdraw the monoply-status of
Telenor from 1. January 1998 like in EU, but have not yet agreeded.
The center and socialistic parties are heavily against the withdrawal,
and with their vast majority, Telenor is likely to keep it's status.

Hope all of this could enlighten some people with the idea that all
what's monopolistic is only greedy and providing lousy services, and
that we one day all may live together in peace.

Ernst keeps insisting that Netscape is a lot easier to install than
Mosaic.  I strongly suspect that this is because the *real* work
involved is getting your SLIP (Serial Link Internet Protocol) account
and socket layer running.  I further suspect that Ernst is writing for
an audience that already has Mosaic, and is planning to upgrade.  In
fact, installation doesn't get a mention until chapter fifteen.  Then,
after a few pages of ftp session in order to download Trumpet Winsock
and Netscape, almost the next thing you read is, "After the Winsock
software is installed and running correctly ..."
 
OK, so we won't get much help with installation.  Other than the
obligatory list of Web sites and history of the Internet, there are
two chapters on the functions of Netscape, itself, and six chapters on
using ftp, Gopher, telnet, Usenet news, email, and search tools via
Netscape.  Most of those chapters deal with the Internet tools rather
than the Netscape interface.

Subject: Modem Function Challenge!  Guru Help Needed
Date: 12 Jun 1995 14:36:42 GMT
Organization: Dataprobe Inc.


I am a manufacturer of wide area communciations products, mostly
automatic and remote switching equipment.  We make a product, the Call
Director which basically works in a similar fashion to home office
voice/fax switches; that is, that it allows a single telephone line to
be shared by multiple devices.  Most of our customers are large
comerical and industrial users who need to access multiple modems.

Reciently, several of our customers have asked for the ability to
access multiple modems during the same telephone call.  Now, our
device will allow calls to be 'transfered' ; holding up the line and
ringing another modem, but several problems remain:

1) Getting the far end modem to hang up.  Our device works on DTMF and
it is not reliable to send DTMF over the modem tones.  We need a way
to force the modem connected to our Call Director to hang up.  We have
looked into 'Long Break Disconnect', but this does not seem to be
universally supported.

2) Local Modem Retraining.  What we have not been able to do at all is
to get a modem to retrain, so to be able to re-establish a link with a
new modem.  The ATO command only returns from Command State to
On-Line, but that is not enough to sync up with the newly answering
modem.

Please give this matter some thought.  If you have any suggestions, I
would be greatful and thank you in advance for your assistance.  If
you would like more information on our Call Director product, please
feel free to get in touch with me.

Subject: Calling MCI Blacklisted Numbers?
Organization: Ripco Internet BBS Chicago
Date: Mon, 12 Jun 1995 15:40:12 GMT


Since the first of May MCI blacklists Telefonenumbers, that means you
can't call a blacklisted number by billing the call to your Calling Card.

Isn't that a shame? Like for me, I only have an MCI Calling Card and
don't want to change my LD company. Is there any legal way to force
MCI to stop that blacklisting?

                         ================

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Let's take it from the top, because I am
not entirely sure of a couple things in your message.  I did not edit the
'word' "Telefonenumbers" in your message because I am not sure if you
meant 'certain telephone numbers' or if there is some type of service
known as 'Telefonenumbers' that MCI is no longer billing for, or what.

All the telcos claim their cards are usable anytime, to call anywhere
using any phone. In fact, all of them have various unofficial, unstated,
unwritten rules they follow blacklisting certain kinds of calls. For
example, AT&T blacklists entire countries when called from 'certain types'
of inner-city neighborhoods at payphones. Nice middle class neighborhoods
are permitted to use calling cards at payphones to call the UK, other
European countries, Australia, New Zealand, etc. On the other hand, if
you are living in the USA as a citizen of Pakistan, Israel, Iraq, most
other middle east countries, India, etc, and live in an ethnic neighborhood
of Chicago, try using a calling card to call *your* country.  <snicker>.

Is it illegal? The telcos claim it is not illegal discrimination in an
extension of credit. Calling cards are technically just 'billing instructions'
rather than an extension of credit, and telco is simply saying they are not
going to honor your billing instructions. A case could be made that they
are engaging in false advertising by claiming their card can be used at
any phone to call anywhere. Quite a few people however claim that when you
permit people to call one country using their calling card but refuse them
the right to call another country, you are in effect discriminating based
on ethnic origin; a big no-no in the USA. AT&T says they do not discriminate
against *selected callers* wishing to bill via calling card to call the
middle east, Israel, India, etc ... they deny *everyone* the right to do
that. The catch is, the people most likely to call those countries on a
regular basis are people who *come from that country*. Since AT&T also
blacklists the payphones of entire neighborhoods with 'certain kinds' of
ethnic people being in residence, it amounts to defacto discrimination.

AT&T refuses to explain their formula for who gets to call where from which
payphones via calling card because they know they are acting illegally, in
the interests of fraud prevention. MCI and Sprint do the same thing. You
want to sue them, go ahead. They get sued all the time; it means nothing.

In addition to denying calling card calls from point A to point B where
they distrust the people in neighborhood A and the people in country B,
some telcos deny calling cards completely -- regardless of destination --
at phones where they have experienced a high degree of fraud. Still other
times, they deny calls to point B regardless of where the call originates
for the same reason: no matter who calls B, they say, no matter where they
call from, it appears B gets mostly fraud calls. I wish the FCC would
address this issue, and force the telcos to improve their calling card
fraud prevention techniques rather than simply inconvenience everyone who
happens to be at the wrong payphone for a call to the wrong place. Yes,
that sort of blanket approach makes it easier for telco, but I believe
it is wrong, and quite possibly illegal in many instances.

Memories: Anyone remember the stink back about 1980-81 when Sprint was
first getting started? They were very high and mighty in those days about
their calling cards and made no attempt to hide their discrimination based
on who calls who from where. At least now-days the telcos are all sneaks
about it; they lie, blame it on the computer, blame it on 'an operator
who was not trained properly', or their old standby, 'the Telecom in 
<country> won't accept our calling card' (big guffaw from your editor at
this point) as if it mattered since we are talking *paid* calls to the
other end.  Anyway, back in 1980-81 Sprint was disallowing calling card
calls pretty much as they pleased, with no real uniformity; just whatever
they felt like doing. 

Sixteen year old kid and his buddy from Podunk are allowed to go on a
summer vacation by themselves to the Rotten Apple. Loving and worried
mother gives son a Sprint calling card to be used in case he gets into
trouble or wants to call home. After all, that's what the Sprint customer
service rep told her the cards were for ... silly mother, she took Sprint
at their word ... gets a calling card and gives it to her son when he and
his buddy set out for a little adventure on their own that summer. Well the
first day, the kids land at the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal; they
get an adventure alright. Their luggage gets stolen, they lose all their
money and probably their innocence as well. But dutiful and obedient child
remembers that nice card his mother gave him, and tries to call home to
report this misfortune. Bingo! Sprint would not accept the card from the
Port Authority payphones or anywhere else within about a mile. It turns
out mother was the county prosecutor in Podunk -- or something similar with
a lot of influence and power. *She* sued Sprint alleging false advertising 
and fraud on Sprint's part and they paid her off to get her to shut up.   
I guess you could probably sue on the 'from anywhere to anywhere' claims
telcos make about their calling cards. 

Let me guess -- are the blacklisted numbers you are trying to call numbers
with a lot of phraud traffic such as phreak BBS lines and such? Is Ripco
being blacklisted also on inbound calls using calling cards?  <grin> ...
As I see it, you have two choices: the subscriber whose connection is 
being refused AND the subscriber whose calls are being withheld from 
receipt can sue MCI. MCI knows you are not going to do that; at least the
odds are very much against it. Your other choice?  Shape up and fly right!
Behave yourself!  <grin> ... not much to choose from is it?     PAT]

Good day ALL,

We presently have a minor war brewing here in Alberta. AGT is getting into
the Internet Provider game.

Presently they supply five or six Inet providers with "Centrix" (?)
lines at $ 30.00/month each.

The game plan is to start charging these providers for "business" class
lines at $ 70.00/month each. This will soften up AGT's competition.

All this is with the CRTC's blessing, given their rules that these low
priced Centrix lines are not allowed to have -data- on them in the first
place.

My question is; How does the CRTC justify this - No data on Centrix lines -
rule, given the fact that these lines can handle my 14,400 modem with no
difficulty?

2nd: Is this ruling just a method of sucking up to the Telco's?

IMHO, the resulting higher prices being imposed, will only take
Internet access farther out of reach of the average dude. Exactly the
opposite of the governments intended plan.

Subject: Recycling Telephone Poles in British Columbia


Here is a press release from BC Tel, formerly known as the British
Columbia Telephone Company. I found the press release on the company's
Web site at "http://www.bctel.net". I don't work for BC Tel. (By the
way, the company is about 51% owned by GTE Corporation.)


June 7, 1995

TELEPHONE-POLE RECYCLING PROJECT LAUNCHED

Burnaby, B.C. - Old telephone and hydro poles are getting new life
thanks to a joint venture involving B.C.Hydro, BC TEL and B.C. Wood
Recycling Ltd.

The three companies are partners in a project to recycle thousands of
old poles into marketable lumber. Every year, about 5,000 poles in the
lower mainland are removed. Now, instead of being disposed in landfill
sites, many of the poles are being shipped to a wood-recycling
facility in Surrey.

First, any embedded nails, bolts or other metallic objects are removed
from the poles. The outer part of the pole, which may have been
treated with preservatives, is then stripped away. Finally, the inside
wood -- usually high-quality untreated cedar -- is cut into a variety
of widths and lengths.

"Approximately 70 per cent of each pole is saved and manufactured into
wood products such as 2x4s, 4x4s, siding, fencing and lumber for
landscaping, said Ray Miller, president of B.C.  Wood Recycling.
"Our sawmill operation employs five people now and we may be expanding
soon to keep up with the demand."

Custom orders can also be arranged. The lumber is available for about
25 per cent less than prices at a retail lumber yard.

"This project is a good example of BC TEL's commitment to reducing and
recycling waste," said Greg Rideout, BC TEL's director of environment.
"In 1994, our company diverted approximately 32 million pounds from
the waste stream through recycling and reusing materials."

B.C.Hydro's manager, safety and environment, Roy Staveley said, "In
addition to maximizing environmental benefits and reducing costs to
both B.C.Hydro and BC TEL, the wood-recycling operation has created
an employment opportunity that supports Hydro's leadership role in the
economic and social development of the province."

B.C. Wood Recycling may be reached at (604) 596-1906.

June 5 - 9 is Environment Week in Canada. For more information, please

Subject: More TSPS Stories


In case anyone was wondering, the rather amatuer sketch below sorta
represents what an AT&T TSPS operator console looked like in the early
80's:

KEY:
BLV - Busy Line Verification
BY - Position Busy (Do not accept calls)
EMER - Emergency Interrupt Key
PR - Position Release (ie HANGUP)
RB - Ring Back (Calling) Party
RF - Ring Forward (Called) Party

Next to each of the CALL Keysets were slots in the console to store
keypunch cards when manually "timing" a call. The "Rate Selection"
keys were more commonly called "timing" keys, since they determined at
what rate the system was to time and bill the call (Operator Assist,
Pers to Pers, Collect, DDD).

There were quite a few more keys, some of which have faded into
memory. But the above is a fairly good representation of what the AT&T
TSPS console looked like. Their locations may also be slightly off,
but you get the picture.

The dial pad, in addition to accepting a valid dialable number, could
accept other numbers and codes not dialable from normal telephone
lines, such as "121" for example to reach the 201 inward operator (to
assist on in-area-code calls), and trouble codes that were supposed to
alert traffic control personnel about possible trouble (such as
repeated reorders, echo, no ring, etc).

There were two sets of headset plugs on the left edge of the console,
one for the operator, and one for a supervisor or trainee. In addition, 
supervisors could sit at actual terminals and log onto TSPS in such a
way as to have their console mimmick every lamp lit and every key
pressed from any console while listening to your call, to act as a
monitoring and evaluation tool. The catch was that this terminal was
in the same room, and all you had to do was watch that terminal
briefly to see if the lamps went on and off in sync with yours.

By the way, AT&T had a strict policy to complete every call in an
average of 30 seconds. Trying to bring your average call time down
after a three minute person-to-person coin-sent-paid call overseas was 
no small feat! We found a trick -- since we worked the night shift
most of the time, we would go into the lounge, where there was a
payphone, and dial 0, wait for one of our associates to answer, then
hang up. We would do this for about five or ten minutes, and the
averages would come back into sync. Kinda sneaky, but it worked.

Finally, there was the dreaded "RED LIGHT OF DOOM" as we liked to call
it. It was a blaring red lamp on the wall that lit when there where
more than five callers waiting in the queue to be answered. When that
light lit, it meant you better hustle and get those calls handled. On
Mother's Day, the lamp almost never went out.

Subject: Will Cable Companies Dominate Internet Access Market?
Date: 13 Jun 1995 10:58:51 +0100
Organization: Demon Internet News Service


Given the large number of cable companies who are reported to be
trialling cable modem technology, I wondered whether other Internet
Service Providers can be viable in the long term. These modems are
reported to offer speeds of between 500kbps to 10Mbps, which is
clearly well beyond that avaiable down an ordinary copper wire, and
would enable all sorts of high bandwidth video applications.

My question is this. The current Internet service providers' business
is based on having open access to the telephone infrastructure --
anybody can dial in to their points of presence via the telephone
network for the cost of a local or national call.  The cable
companies, however, will have little incentive to open up their
networks to allow third party access, unless they are forced to do so by
regulation -- and can furthermore offer a superior service.  So what
happens to the internet service providers once cable modems take off --
and customers start migrating to the cable companies?

I would be very interested in any views on this topic -- particularly if
you believe another outcome is possible.

Subject: Help With Accessing X.25 Network to UK
Date: Tue, 13 Jun 1995 06:36:01 EDT


After a somewhat extended absence from the Digest, I return with a 
question:

We are trying to connect with a number of paging systems in the UK via
X.25. Currently, we page our customers in the UK (as well as elsewhere
around the world) by placing an actual phone call to their paging
system, and relaying alpha/numeric data that way.

While we have a number of very competitive long distance providers 
(compared to AT&T, MCI, et. al.), we still have to charge UK customers 
something on the order of 20 - 25 cents per page in order to access the 
various paging systems there.

However, a number of paging and SMS companies in the UK have indicated 
that they would be willing to allow us to access their paging terminals 
(the equipment that they use to send out pages to their customers) if we 
could connect to them via X.25 and send out our paging information that 
way. 

With that in mind, I made a number of inquiries with local telephone
companies, LD companies, and even British Telecom (whose US office did
not return any of my phone calls, BTW :( ). All of them were met with
"You want to do what?!", or "No one uses X.25, we're phasing that out"
(quote from NYTel...). Rather than waste my time with this nonsense
(and so that I can begin to catch up on some more work so I can start
posting about cellular service again on the Digest! :) ), I figured
I'd inquire here.

Basically, what we need is a means to send X.25 messages to the UK on
a rather sporadic basis. Although we have a number of customers there,
we do not by any means have a steady, 24-hour flow of traffic which
would justify a dedicated line.

Ideally, I'd like Interpage to be able to pick up a phone, dial out to 
some "X.25 port", enter an access code, etc., and then transmit a 
message to a paging company in the UK, or elsewhere. After the message is 
transmitted, we hang up, and do not connect again until we need to send 
out another page. 

After looking over BT's literature, it seems like they offer such a
service, and yet they were the ones who never phoned back. Additionally,
although we may know a thing or two about the Internet (maybe :) ), we
don't really know too much about X.25. So we are sort of in the dark on 
this one, and could use some help.

Thus, first off, is there any good, brief, non-technical explanation 
of the X.25 protocol, what X.25 networks exist, how X.25 networks are 
interconnected, and how one would access a given network or set of networks?

Secondly, is our idea a workable/practical solution to these high 
per-page costs? That is, could we transmit alpha pages of 240 characters 
(or numeric pages if the distant terminal permits) via X.25 at less than 
20 cents per page, with a reasonable monthly access rate?

We would also be willing to explore giving free access to our system to 
a firm which will allow us to connect to their X.25 network providing 
(and perhaps I don't understand this correctly) that we can use their 
X.25 connection to send pages to the UK and elsewhere.

Again, sorry for my lack of knowledge regarding both the form, 
organization, and structure of X.25 networking and it's current 
implementations. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

P.S. It's been too long ... I just can't resist! :)

- Cell One/Boston's cutover to AT&T's Autoplex switches is STILL not
complete, despite having one month now after the conversion to correct
all the bugs.  Some bugs aren't small: CO/NY customers roaming in
Boston can *forward* their calls, but are unable to unforward them.
Different CO/Boston accounts (ie, 617/508, etc.) have different
feature codes which do not work properly.  Call delivery at night
continues to be spotty at times.

- Cell One/VT customers again have lost the use of their *28/*29
feature codes. They can not reliably turn on and off automatic call
delivery. Two weeks ago, CO/VT customers could not use feature codes
in the Boston 00007 system, but the could in CO/Boston's NH 01485
system, the only remaining portion of CO/Boston's service area
operating directly under a Motorola EMX.

- Metro Mobile/CT (BAMS) 00119 customers as a result of the above can
not force calls back to voicemail anywhere in the CO/VT 00313 system,
including Franklin County, which used to be part of the Metro Mobile
system. (A good way to get out of your MM service contracts!)

- SNET/CT has almost completed through-service along US-7 in Western
CT.  US-7 extends from Norwalk, CT on Long Island Sound due North to
Mass, VT, and the Canadian border. It is almost totally covered in VT
by CO/VT, and in Mass by both the A (Metro Mobile) and B (SNET and
NYNEX, soon to be SNET only) carriers. CT's portion of northern US-7,
however had no coverage until recently. SNET now covers most of US-7,
to about 10 miles south of the Mass border. On southern sections of
US-7, covered by Metro Mobile and SNET, coverage is adequate, but the
McCaw-owned Cell One/Litchfield County has no service whatsoever along
US-7 (or most anywhere else for that matter) in Litchfield County.
SNET's progress in that area has totally eclipsed the service
offerings that the "A" side currently provides, as they continue to
take advantage of being the only carrier in CT to cover all of the
state. IMHO, Cell One/Litchfield should be acquired by Metro Mobile to
create a statewide, unified A-side to compete with the "B".

Anyhow, got that out of my system ...! :) More on these topics and others 
later, when I get a minute.

There is a rumour floating around London today that BT will launch a bid

The major monopoly issue that would arise -- BT would now own the main
competition, Mercury -- would be averted by BT immediately selling Mercury.

C&W shares have risen 12 points this morning on the news.

Subject: What Does Mike Harris Election in Ontario Mean For Telecom?


On June 8, Ontario voters elected the Conservative party, headed by
Mike Harris. (Harris has not yet been sworn in as premier, but that
will happen in a few days.)

Telecommunications policy is primarily a federal responsibility in
Canada, but the new government's plans to reduce welfare payments
may lead to a lot of welfare recipients having their phone service
disconnected because they are unable to pay their phone bills.

Bell Canada does not currently have means-tested "lifeline" local
service for low-income subscribers, although two-party service is
available at lower rates than conventional service. But I suspect the
combination of cutbacks by the provincial government in social
assistance payments (and by the federal government in unemployment
insurance benefits) and increases in monthly local service rates and
installation charges will make some kind of lifeline telephone service
necessary in Canada.

A less visible consequence of the new Ontario government's cutbacks
policy may be the layoff of some or all of the telecommunications
policy experts within the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.
Computer and telecommunications operations personnel within the
Management Board of Cabinet may also see their jobs vanish if they
work they do is turned over to an outside contractor.

All in all, it's not a good time to be poor or a government employee
in Ontario.

  There has been alot of talk lately about Video on Demand and High
Bandwidth Internet access via the telephone system. There are
technologies developed/ing such as fibre-to-the-home and ADSL (via
copper pairs) which can provide tele- phony links capable of
transferring 2Mb/s.

  I would be grateful for any information concerning the use of
Broadband Radio to provide the last drop to the home (thus avoiding
the expensive installation costs and the limited bandwidth of the
copper pair.)

  So far I have come across the following systems which could be used;
Cellular Vision, Liberty Communications (Milicom), Time Space Radio
and a couple of BT systems.

  There are also quite a few systems for Radio in the Local Loop which
are capable of providing a basic ISDN line (or less) such as Ionica,
CT2, DECT and the many mobile technologies such as IS-54/95, GSM,
AMPS. I am interested to know if any of these systems could be
altered, say by using the technologies at a microwave frequency to
provide a high bandwidth and smaller cell size for re-use.

  I would like to know about systems for the UK/Europe and about other
systems from countries such as USA (even though the frequencies used
may be unavaliable here.)

  Any information, discussions on the above, or pointers to systems
which I have not come across would be most welcome.

Subject: "Transfer" to Voice Mail With POTS
Date: Tue, 13 Jun 1995 11:50:18 EDT


I am looking for a way (either a PC voice card and software or answering
machine) to send an already answered call to "voice mail".  

The way I'd like it to work is this:

  1) Answer the call and determine it's not for me (ie for roommate).

  2) Press keypad digit (or a button on an answering machine) to 
take over the call and take the message.  I should be able to hangup the
extension at this point.

Ideally it would work from any phone in the house but if it worked
only from the machine it would be ok.  Also multiple (3+) mail boxes
would be great.  Does anyone know of an existing machine that can do
this?  Alternatively is there a voice card that could be programed to
do the same?  I could probably handle the programming myself if I had
documentation.

If I go the voice card route I'd like a card that can detect when
another extension on the same line is off hook.  That would enable me
to know when the voice card should be "listening".  Alternatively it
could probably be done with timers and such but not as cleanly.

Any ideas?

Subject: Question: Two Phone Lines on Three Wires; is it Possible?


I was looking in to adding a second line to a house build in the early
1960's in GTE-land in NC.  The house is wired throughout with three-wire
(not three-pair) cable, i. e. red-green-yellow.  Line number one uses red
and green.

My question is, is it possible to get GTE to run a second line down
the yellow, using one of the previous wires as a common return?  Is
there something special I need to do to get them to do this?  How does
one determine which is the common return?  I spoke to their customer
service reps about this, but it seems that GTE is sitll hiring people
who cannot even effectively put people on hold while they ask up the
chain of command something they don't know (I was cut off), so I tend
to a priori distrust the answer I might get from them.

Add to that that they're trying to aggressively sell inside wiring
service, whereby they run the wire from the demark point to "a new
jack".  I wouldn't mind paying the extra money so much, it's just that
the quality of the wiring I tend to get from them is ugly and bad -
wires in plain site, poorly tied down, exposed to elements, and/or
fatigue failure through repeated motion, ignoring previous conduit and
wire passageway infrastructure, etc.

The second line would be used for data transmission, so this may mean
that FDM multiplexing is not an option.  The equipment for that is not
usually readily available for customer-side wiring, anyway.  Please
reply also by e-mail, if you would.

Thanks for any information you may have.

Date: 13 Jun 1995 18:22:58 GMT

Reply-To: dave@tricon.net


I am having an argument with my local telco regarding centrex lines.
We operate an ISP that requires dozens of incoming telco lines which
allow our users to dial a local number and connect to our analog
modems on a free local call basis.  In examining our tariff, we found
that Centrex lines with no features were very inexpensive.  The tariff
says you only need a NAR for outgoing calls.  Obviously since all
calls on these lines are incoming only, no long distance is involved,
and we would only need the minimum of one NAR as per the tariff.

The tariff does state that we would be required to have one NAR
per line if the line will be connected to terminal equipment
capable of "extending" the call (ie an electronic key or PBX system).
The local telco has now told us that they interpret our connecting
modems to these lines as "extending" the calls, and therefore
the requirement of one NAR per line (which makes the centrex lines
even more expensive than a regular line) applies.

In my humble opinion, the "call" terminates in our modem.

Do any of you telecom experts know of a test case where this concept
has been judged to be either valid or invalid?

They seem to think that because a user has access via our host to
the Internet via the modem, the call is being "extended".

The cost difference between a regular line, and a centrex line with no
features and no NAR is substantial.  At one point a telco manager
said "Well, the tariff may say you can get this, but we can't make
any money selling it to you, so we won't."

I won't mention any names here, but please email me if you can help!

[TELECOM Digest Pervert Editor's Note: Ah, but be careful fellow perverts!
It is one of those thirty dollars for the first minute lines, with *very 
little* mention that the charge will given to the caller who presses
certain buttons on the phone. They do not ask for any credit card
number, nor do they refer you to a 900 number, etc. They just start
breathing heavily and telling you about the kinds of things they're
going to do to you and would like you to do to them. If you press a
couple buttons on your phone once they answer apparently the charges
commence at that point. Best use a payphone to call this number rather
than risk having the charges come through to you, or else call it from
your office or a hotel switchboard, etc. And remember, where 800
numbers are concerned, the use of *67 means nothing, so take care
these ladies don't get their hands in your wallet or purse without you
realizing it. No true pervert ever wants to have to pay for it. Let's 
check and see if they were smart enough to block payphones and COCOTS
from reaching them.  Reports experiences back here please.  PAT]

The FCC is probably in dire need of "process re-engineering".  But the
idea of eliminating an agency that keep telecommunications in order is
nuts.
 
The "Progress and Freedom Foundation" plan to abolish the FCC seems to
have been created by a group of people that do not understand the
first thing about radio based (wireless) communications.  There is an
entire list of people involved with the proposal whose titles give no
indication they are qualified to propose ideas that have any impact on
"technology".  These people seem to primarily be lawyers and
economists.
 
While they make some good point abouts technology being slowed by
regulation and the cost of compliance, their proposal would be a
technical nightmare.
 
The PFF has a web site.  http://www.pff.org 
The "Plan to Abolish the FCC" is in a document titled "The Telecom   
Revolution - - An American Opportunity". 
http://www.pff.org/telecom_revolution.html 
 
Happy reading.

go get the document in question.   PAT]

It also doesn't seem to (based on published reports, I haven't read
the original document) deal with ITU-T regulations which establish
permitted uses for virtually the entire spectrum.  Those regulations
have the force of law under international treaties that the U.S. has
ratified.  The PFF proposal apparently would turn the U.S. into an
international outlaw by allowing uses of the spectrum that are
inconsistent with the ITU-T rules.

The idea is that DOJ will handle complaints or enforcement issues as
you describe -- kind of hard to believe that an interferrence issue
would be resolved through them -- in the courts?? Even Newt couldn't
dream up something like this. It boggles my mind. They see the 150+
people in the FCC's licensing division and see this as a great
reduction in cost. I am amazed.

I didn't see this program, but am reasonably familiar with the problems 
and how FCC handles them.

Occasionally there will be band openings on VHF and UHF bands.
Fortunately, these are rare.  When this happens, the stations simply
must accept the interference, as I'm certain a perusal of the FCC
regulations will show.  They don't "own" the frequency -- they're given
the use of it IN A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA.  If through no fault of
their own Mother Nature decides to "change the rules" for a while,
they just have to tolerate it.

Broadcast stations are under very strict rules regarding antenna radiation
patterns and such.  Also, in areas frequently subject to propagation (i.e.
Los Angeles and San Diego, 120 miles apart), TV stations are made on
adjacent channels (LA has 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13; San Diego has 8 and 10,
and maybe others??  I live in LA), which minimizes interference potential.

Along these lines, I've heard that an old CBer "trick" to shut up
"channel hogs" was to get a cheap CB walkie-talkie, move the transmit
crystal to receive (placing maybe a few hundred microwatts on the
selected channel), tie it to a piece of twine, put a two ounce sinker on
the other end, and toss it "bolero style" into the offending antenna,
with the result that the affected station heard nothing but a loud
heterodyne on that channel until the battery ran down.  By using 6
penlight cells, this could be weeks.

While I certainly don't like "gestapo" type operations, I don't see the
FCC's enforcement of CB violations in this light.

Illegal CB operation is a serious problem.  CB requires no electronic
knowledge (and most CBers do their darndest to meet this requirement
 :-), and is therefore restricted to four watts and 40 channels.  When
CBers use 100 or 1000 watt amplifiers that they don't know how to
properly tune for minimum interference to other services, and
overmodulate their CBs with so-called "power mikes" (actually simple
preamplified microphones that drive the AM modulation amplifier to
more than 100% of the RF amplifier power, thereby causing splatter
into other channels -- not unlike splashing water out of the bathtub by
moving it too hard), it generates RF outside the CB frequencies.

Because of this illegal operation, much trouble has been caused for
others.  The most obvious are users of other services, i.e.
telephones, broadcast radio and TV, and even home audio equipment.

But IMO the most serious is the "guilt by association" that has
affected the Amateur Radio Service (HAM radio).  For example, many
housing owners associations and such now have restrictions against ANY
type of antennae because of illegal CB activities.  While there are
exceptions, most amateur radio (HAM) operators are good neighbors.
Hams are important to their communities, as they provide emergency
communications when everything else is down -- but they can't do it
without decent antennas.  We have entire communities where outside
(inside antennas are pretty well worthless for serious reliable long
distance communications) antennas are prohibited.  And when "the big
one" hits (whichever "big one" your area might be prone to), it's
likely that people will pay with their lives because of this
misunderstanding regarding CBers and hams.

The FCC has cut back on enforcement of illegal CB operation.  There
was a recent story on TV about a CBer running illegal power who
rendered a home-operated business phone unusable for most of the day.
It's hard for me to view the FCC as some kind of "Gestapo" operation
if this is the kind of thing they're enforcing.

As far as I'm aware, the FCC has never just "gone out looking for
CBers".  They would usually respond to specific complaints, and only
after sending written notice to the concerned parties.

My experience has been that, the more I know about the FCC and its
actions, viewed in the light of understanding, the more they tend to
make sense.  Yes, some of the things they do are wrong, out of date,
not in keeping with modern day technology, etc., but these tend to be
in the minority.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Anymore -- since around 1985 or so? --
the FCC apparently couldn't care less what the CB'ers do. Please note
that licensing isn't even required any longer; it is voluntary. I guess
they finally gave up on it. Not so in the 1970's though; you are correct
it was mostly in response to complaints from others that the FCC police
would go out looking for people in ernest. There were a few pretty well
publicized raids where they kicked the door in, went in and started
pulling out wires, seizing the radios, etc. It was not much different
than what we have seen with Secret Service/FBI raids on errant computer
sites during the past decade.  PAT]

For those interested in the ongoing restructuring of the spectrum
under 512 MHz, Part 90 replaced by Part 88, aka "Refarming," it has
finally made it to the June 15 public meeting agenda. The Commission
will implement the rulemaking order and initiate yet another NPRM
regarding migration to the new offset channels. Summarized, Refarming
splits the channels in to thirds eventually, requiring existing 25KHz
channels to go to 12.5, and eventually 6.25 KHz. The order will
require all equipment sold as of 1-1-96 to be 25/12.5 compatible, for
starters. If you are a private land mobile user under 512 this will
effect you. It also does away with 1/4" of pages containing outdated
administrative regulations.

It seems to me that this *idea* that the Federal Government is going
to balance the budget by selling off radio spectrum is one of the most
ridiculous ones to come down the pike in some time. The recent sell
off of 120 MHz of Private Microwave spectrum (about 20 TV channels
worth?)  generated something like $7 billion. That is a lot of money,
until you start dealing with the Federal Government. I do not have all
the figures, such as what this years deficit is, but I beleive the
best comparison is that this is much like someone giving me enough
money to pay one month's house payment. I will gladly take it but six
months from now it will have made no difference at all. The government
is going to have to stop spending so much money. Even if they do
manage to balance the budget one year, which is doubtful, what about
all of the years after?

From: David G. Cantor <dgc@ccrwest.org>


While recent proposals to abolish the FCC may seem extreme, they do
suggest that the purpose and function of the FCC should be re-evaluated 
and revised.  The FCC has numerous functions including:

1. Assigning spectrum, historically at no charge, but recently, at
auctions.

2. Setting standards.

3. Establishing and enforcing regulations.

4.  Setting, in large part, US Government communications policy

How successful has the FCC been in these and other areas?  For
example, is its assignment of spectrum rational?  Is it fair?  Is
spectrum used efficiently?  Does the assignment serve the best
interests of the US public?

Are the standards set by the FCC reasonable?  How do they compare
with private standards?  The latter include, for example, standards
for VCRs, CDs, PCs, etc. Are the standards consistent with modern
technology?

Are the regulations enforced adequately and fairly?

Is US policy clear?  Is it appropriate?  Is it adequate?

My personal belief is that the FCC is deficient in all of the above,
areas but I believe that these and numerous other questions should be
examined.  What do other telecom readers think?

        I'm not really defending the movie, I haven't even seen it
yet ... (Though I know I'll definitely see it, at least as a rental.
I see most "mainstream" movies eventually. The most recent movie I
saw I recommend very strongly -- "Forget Paris".  Shmaltzy romantic
movie(*), but absolutely hilarious also.)

        I presume you are aware that this is based on William Gibson's
short story, and he wrote the script (possibly with other people doing
some revisions).  It's not like I like lies about _anything_, though
it's just a movie!  Do people really believe that Forrest Gump was
involved in Watergate?  Hopefully not, but it was a hilarious gag.
(As well as him investing in Apple -- "some fruit company or
something".)

        Plus, the idea of the moderator of a newsgroup totally bashing
a movie seems odd.  It seems that usually you don't take sides for/against 
other people's stuff as much.
 
(*) That's not really an insult.  I really liked "When Harry Met Sally" and
"While You Were Sleeping..." too.  But they are generally considered sappy 
sweet movies and "women's" movies.

  Both of you failed to follow the first rule of consumption: caveat
emptor; let the buyer beware.

  I read this story when it appeared in Omni magazine back ten years
ago, and I tried reading it two or three times, but could never get
into it, and didn't understand all the hype associated with it.  That
Omni is probably collecting dust back at Mom's house.  Maybe I can
sell it now.  =)

  William Gibson is a non-tech person who writes about technology in a
philosophical way that seems literarily or poetically palatable.
Translation: he knows nothing, and makes it all up to be dramatic,
like those Gothic, overdramatic Victorians did (e.g., Frankenstein, &c.).

  He did not, by his own admission, even know what a disk drive was
until a few years ago, *after* writing the works that made him famous.

  This is a view of technology from a non-technologist, written for
non-technologists.  His fans don't read Dilbert, and we don't read his
books.  =)  And there ain't nothing wrong with that.

  You know something is skewed in the universe when Rogert Ebert looks
at Gene Siskel on their weekly review show and yells something like,
"why the hell didn't they just use some satellite transmission with a
sophisticated encryption scheme, something which you can do today,
deliver this data, and end the movie in about two seconds?"

From: Mark Cuccia <mcuccia@law.tulane.edu>
Subject: AT&T 'True(?) Messages'
Date: Tue, 13 Jun 95 10:26:00 GMT


Due to my call-forwarding situation (my home phone forwards on
no-answer (three-rings) and busy to my cellular, and my cellular
forwards to Bell South Mobility's Mobile Memo voicemail after about
five-rings), many friends and relatives calling via AT&T from out of
the local calling area were telling me that they were 'cut-off' after
about three to four rings.  I told them that they really weren't being
cut-off that soon and to just stay on the line and wait anyway for my
voicemail to pick-up - IGNORE that DAMN recording from AT&T stating
that they could 'forward' a message (for an extra CHARGE) by entering
#123.  They did not realize that my cellphone or mailbox was still
ringing in the connection (but not indicated to them, the caller)
while the AT&T recording was playing.

I have NEVER used #123 to leave a 'forwarding message'.  If the
message did not get through, does AT&T still charge the caller?  And
what about answering machines & voicemail on the receiving end - The
AT&T automated message forwarding would already start playing the
caller's prerecorded message while the called party's voicemail/answering-
machine was playing out ITS outgoing message and not yet in the record
mode for incomming calls. Machine-to-Machine does NOT always work as well 
as Machine-to-Human or vice-versa, or Human-to-Human.

I also find it INSULTING when, after I hear the standard busy I have heard 
all my life, the AT&T True Message prompts you with 'The Line is Busy- to 
leave a message...'; I KNOW ITS BUSY - I JUST HEARD A BUSY SIGNAL!!!!

When I press # on an unanswered or busy AT&T calling card call, I am NOT 
going to enter 123 -- I will enter the next sequence call.

I called AT&T this morning and demanded a supervisor- I was connected
with a pleasant lady who told me that she has worked for 'The Telephone 
Company' since 1964. (It's always nice to speak with someone from the
old Bell System days). She told me that they would program the system
so that anyone using AT&T to call me at my home phone number would NOT
get the 'True Messages' prompts. It will work the way I want it within
four days. (of course, they could 'time-out' to a disconnect due to an
unanswered call, but in my situation described above, if someone calls
even my home number first and lets it roll over to the cellular and
continues to let it roll over to voicemail, it is within the
threshold.

I also requested that my calling card numbers be flagged so that when
*I* place an outgoing AT&T call charged to these valid AT&T accepted
telecommunications cards (I also keep my South Central Bell card), *I*
would not be insulted with 'True Messages'.  She told me that they do
not offer this feature but would take my comments and forward them to
'Headquarters'.

I also thanked her but told her that I would post this on Internet and also 
sent a comment about this to the Common Carrier Bureau of the FCC.  If AT&T 
(and local telcos) can flag a line as 3d-pty-bill-back RESTRICT or collect 
RESTRICT, or if they can flag a calling card account-number Plus PIN as 
restricted to calling specific numbers, then why couldn't they flag MY card 
numbers in their Database as 'NO True Messages'.

I also informed her about my dislike of the way AT&T operators are presently 
connected to the line and the different time-zone situation (see my article 
in TD v.15#278, 'History of TSPS/TOPS/OSPS').  She also politely said that 
my complaints/suggestions in THIS matter would also be forwarded to 
'Headquarters'.

Of course, 'no-true-messages' on calls comming TO my home phone number will 
only work on calls via AT&T- I don't know if any other carriers or local 
telcos also offer this ANNOYANCE 'feature'.  I DO remember several posts to 
this Forum back in April on 'Annoying Feature on Payphones'.  While Bell 
doesn't semm to offer that on its payphones DURING the connection, Bell HAS 
posted a 'messaging forwarding' 800 service on the instruction cards on its 
payphones (but I haven't seen that for the past six years). 

Scum-of-the-Earth-Private-Payphones are another matter, of course.

   Subject: June COOK Report Announcement

Gordon Jacobson says that he believes I forgot to post my announcement
of the June issue to inet access.  He is the author of a critique of
the NYNEX position and wants to make reference to that if I understand
him correctly.

so ...

The June COOK Report on Internet -> NREN is published today.  At
NYNEX's request we have embargoed this issue since we completed it on
May 18.  We present a lengthly exclusive intreview with NYNEX on its
Internet plans, a lengthy critique of same, and a review of ANCS as
AT&T's Internet strategy.

NYNEX Internet Plans  pp. 1-9

We interview Carl Ford, Staff Director Product Development, NYNEX
Business Markets.  Carl has been responsible for the development of
NYNEX's Internet strategy which is expected to have a formal launch in
the autumn.  NYNEX is planning an IP dial tone.

To ISPs in its service area it will say let us provide your modem
pools and terminal servers.  It suggests that this will save new ISPs
some of their capital start up costs and benefit NYNEX by avoiding it
having to install 50 and 100 pair cables into homes and residential
neighborhoods.  At the same time such a dial tone will also enable
NYNEX to be a player in connecting telecommuters to corporate
networks.  This could be done by AT&T's Netware Connect Services
(ANCS) or "by other means" which is how he phrased his response when
we asked him if ANCS was in the picture.

He talks about solving the inter LATA MFJ restrictions by creating an
Internet hub within each LATA and inviting entities like NEARnet and
NYSERnet to connect to each of them. He indicates that NYNEX is
plainly interested in moving into network management services for
ISPs.  Levels 3 through 5 will provide NYNEX with financial
oppportunities that basic transport does not.

Yet he says it is not NYNEX's intention to try to move into areas
where existing ISPs are comfortable in providing their own services.
Rather he wants to provide services to enable new and less experienced
ISPs to test the marketplace.

NYNEX services will be provided through frame relay PVCs.  Basic
services with be provided through what NYNEX is calling Open Net.
Safe Net would add commercial web servers and strong network security
of the type that would interest large commercial clients.  NYNEX Net
would be a full blown NYNEX internet service.

Ford considers NYNEX Net unlikely in the near term.  He paints NYNEX's
philosophy as Jeffersonian and decentralized in contrast to a head end
strategy that says we know best what the whole world needs.


NYNEX Critique  

pp. 10 - 16

Gordon Jacobson is a New York City based telecommunications consultant
who has been studying the ISP marketplace very closely.  We asked him
to read and comment on our interview with NYNEX.  He did so
extensively providing an overview and annotated commentary that is
only about 20% shorter than the original interview.

Basically Gordon finds NYNEX's strategy to be one of setting itself up
in businessto become a giant ISP in a couple of year's time.  He
asserts that the cost savings to an IP startup of not having to
provide its own modem pool and terminal server are not that great.  He
warns that ISPs who buy the NYNEX service are in effect placing their
customers in NYNEX hands - ripe for the taking when and if NYNEX
introduces a full blown NYNEX Net.

He states: "While it may be true that NYNEX's offer may allow all of
the Tom, Dick and Harrys to become ISPs, that possibility begs the
question: "Should the marketplace become so fractionalized by little
providers servicing ten and twenty customers that there are not enough
substantive providers around to stand up to the majors if and when
they try to "corner the market?"

He vigorously disagrees with Ford's discussion of regulatory and
technical issues that will influence the pricing of NYNEX servcices.
He paints the strategy as that of the wolf in sheep's clothing and
despite Ford's protestations of being a Jeffersonian finds his model
to be one of top down design.  He takes Ford's assertions about
backbone bandwidth weaknesses and an inherent need for settlements and
shows why he believes them to be technically inaccurate.

He is not impressed by Ford's assertion that while NYNEX would not
charge users for megabytes sent and received, it likely would place a
hourly charge on port usage beyond some to be defined limit.  He does
find NYNEX's designs for a Safe Net to be a desirable business market
place niche for it to fulfill.  Overall he feels that Ford may have
floated some trial balloons with us and suggests that NYNEX needs to
do a much more thorough job of researching what subscribers and ISPs
are asking for, what they actually need and what the time frames are
in which their needs realistically must be met.
  

AT&T's Internet Strategy pp.1, 17 - 20 

We present a literature review of AT&T's partnership with Novell in
the development of AT&T NetWare Connect Services (ANCS) now in beta
test with Ziff Davis, Hallmark Cards, and Millard Refigeration.

By moving TCP/IP into the Netware kernel, ANCS promises to offer
corporate, university and governmental LAN managers a seemless and
easy way to connect their LANs into a wide area network, one which,
because it can be run across AT&T's huge global network, offers the
prospect of a private Internet with better security services than the
publicly available global Internet. A niche market for AT&T.  But a
huge and lucrative one.

AT&T also has a WAN version of Lotus Notes called Network Notes.
According to one of the trade journals AT&T is positioning it to
compete with the Microsoft Network.

Why is ANCS important?  As explained in the March 27 Computer Reseller
News, TCP/IP has been given "equal footing with IPX in NetWare
environments by unbundling IPX from the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) so
that IP can be tightly coupled with NCP ... "

We were surprised by the general lack of awareness of ANCS among
technical Internet sources whom we querried. Connecting NetWare LANs
to the Internet is done all the time.  However under the IPX version
of NetWare, the process is kludgy and time consuming.  If ANCS works
as advertised, and if AT&T prices it attractively, it should create a
potentially major market, they all agreed.  Another unknown is the
kind and extent of linkage to the global Internet that ANCS will offer
its customers. There will surely be some linkage.  However, the ANCS
developments represent yet another fragmentation of the Internet into
private value added services.  We wonder if a time may be reached when
the public internet becomes a less valuable commodity because of this
fragmentation?

We have also heard rumors that AT&T is going to launch a major dial up
gateway to the Internet and other AT&T network services before the end
of the summer.  Tom Evslin VP of Network Services and Marni Ehrlich,
ANCS Marketing Director were frequently mentined in the trade
literature on ANCS.  Erik Grimmelmann the PI on AT&T's portion of the
InterNic and the AT&T insider we have known as responsible for AT&T's
Internet strategy since February of 1992 was never mentioned. Yet when
we called into AT&T we found that Ehrlich reports to Grimmelmann who
in turn reports to Evslin.  This confirmed our belief that AT&T at
last does have an internet strategy worth noticing and that it is
ANCS.

ALPHANUMERIC PAGING SOFTWARE NOW SHIPPING

Fremont, Calif., June 13, 1995 -- PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY TOOLS, Inc
today announced the availability of version 2.2 of the ETHERPAGE(TM)
alphanumeric paging solution for Unix workstations. ETHERPAGE is the
first commercial product to provide an enterprise-wide alphanumeric
paging capability for unix workstation networks.  Targeted at
organizations that require a client-server solution, EtherPage
provides exceptional robustness to insure that messages are delivered
efficiently and without fail. Priced from $595 to $2195, the product
is shipping now for SunOS 4.1.X, Solaris 2.x and HP-UX.

INTEGRATION

EtherPage supports automatic generation of pages from email, from user
written scripts, and user written programs. A C application
programming interface makes it possible for users to add a robust
paging capability to their applications. EtherPage can be integrated
tightly into numerous network monitoring environments including SunNet
Manager, HP Openview, Tivoli, Boole & Babbage, and numerous others.

FEATURES

The following summarizes key features of the product:
    Command line interface, suitable for user written scripts
    GUI interface, available for Openlook and Motif
    Pager aliases which allow messages to be sent to multiple pagers
    Extremely powerful filtering capabilities which allow messages to
      be sent to different pagers based on time of day, day of
      week, recipient, sender, message content, etc
    Automatic insertion of sender identification into messages
    Automatic suppression of duplicate messages
    Automatic splitting of long messages into multiple pages
    Automatic forwarding of messages between multiple servers
    Support for multiple concurrent modems
    User definable per paging service message size limits
    Automatic email confirmation
    Automatic truncation of messages
    Job logging and accounting
    User definable shell scripts with macro expansion for handling
      successful/failed delivery of messages
    User definable retry limits
    Robust handling of modem errors
    Robust handling of phone line problems including busy, no answer
    Robust handling of paging service errors such as invalid pager id
    Error recovery including automatic email of problem report
    Job batching for rapid delivery of jobs in a single phone call
    Client-server architecture for centralized management
    UUCP style tty locking for shared tty/modem usage
    User definable modem configuration
    Symbolic configuration files for easy maintenance
    Support for IXO, TAP, PET protocols
    Support for SNPP (RFC 1645) protocol
    Support for touch-tone message delivery

ROBUST, EFFICIENT, DEPENDABLE

EtherPage provices extremely robust delivery of messages. A message
queuing system insures that messages are always delivered.  Messages
are batched for efficient delivery to the paging service.
Sophisticated error recovery insures that messages are delivered
reliably. EtherPage will work with most Hayes compatable modems, and
utilizes industry standard protocols used by virtually all paging
services.

EASE OF USE

A graphical user interface makes sending messages easy. A real-time
graphical display of job status gives users feedback on the status of
their jobs. Jobs can be removed from the queue if desired. A command
line interface is available which makes integration with user written
scripts, and programs easy. The product is easily integrated with
email and network monitoring tools for automatic generation of
messages.

Subject: Out of Town Dial Tones
Date: Tue, 13 Jun 95 15:17:06 EDT


Several years ago I worked in New Jersey.  I dialed my company's (a long
distance company no less) 1-800 service number to dispatch a tech to our
Chicago office.  However, since I was dialing from NJ, I got the dispatch
that serviced that particular section of that state.  In order to dispatch
a tech to Chicago, someone would need to place the call from Chicago.  We
temporarily got around it by calling our systems administrator in Chicago
and asking him to forward us to that 1-800 number.  My boss and I wondered
if there was a way to call a particular number to get a Chicago or Atlanta
or Pittsburgh, or what have you dial tone.  We never did get an answer.
However, I'm still curious, is this possible?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: You can install in your Chicago office or
wherever you please a device known as a 'call extender' to do what you
want. Connect an incoming phone line to its front end, and an outgoing line 
to its other side. Now, when you call into the device, it goes off hook and 
gives you the dial tone from the other side. Of course, you get stuck with
paying for two phone calls; one to the device and the one out from the
device.  It might help if you passcode it, to prevent everyone else who
discovers this from abusing it for their own purposes. Generally call
extenders (also known as WATS extenders) are only practical if they are
located in the same local calling area as yourself. That is, do you want
to pay for two phone calls instead of one? When used as WATS extenders,
they used to make sense for people away from the office who wanted to
make long distance calls at the cheaper rate they got in the office via
WATS than the rate they would pay from a payphone. 

If you absolutely must have the dialtone of a distant community for
your call rather than the existing long distance network to get where
you want, something like this would work. If you require only access
to one single number in the distant community, but it is only
reachable via local dialtone, then you can also have a number at that
end permanently left on call forwarding to wherever it is you want.
You can get this from the telco in the distant community or by
arrangement with some associate in the desired place. This of course
restricts your options to just the one number; if you want the
flexibility of calling several places in that community, then use the
call extender described above.

You can also get what telco calls 'foreign exchange service' where dial
tone from the desired community is brought directly to you over leased
wires via your local telco. The cost on this is horrendous; they charge
by the mile for the connection and it is very rare these days that FX
service makes any sense at all with long distance rates as cheap as they
are. FX simply gives you phone service, i.e. dialtone, from the telco
and community of your choice rather than the telco in the community
where you are located. 

This all seems to have come up because a vendor you were dealing with
(in this case, your own employer -- how embarassing!)  had no
provision for serving customers who were not in the right place at the
right time apparently; and that is a shame. It should be the job of
the vendor to notify his other offices of customer needs and requirements 
and not your obligation to dance around like this trying to get phone
calls through in obscure ways at considerable expense to yourself. 800
numbers which are restricted by locality are rather rare these days.
It used to be a big thing to get your 800 IN-WATS number 'banded' for
what areas you wanted to receive calls and did not want them. Now most
800 numbers can be reached from anywhere, and if a vendor chooses to
use time-of-day and/ or location routing on his 800 line, he also
needs to be responsible for getting customers correctly routed who
wind up at the wrong center for whatever reason.  PAT]

Patrick,

Here's an interesting chart for your readers.

10 times 1, 2 or 5. Most of the links are to small images. Suggestions
and contributions are welcomed, especially picture files or pointers

The numbers quoted are approximate. In fact a kilobyte is 1024 bytes
not 1000 bytes but this fact does not keep me awake at night.

The etymology of these words used for very large numbers 
is explained here.

Subject: Telecom Decency Act Passes Senate 84-16 
Date: Thu, 15 Jun 1995 21:10:00 CDT


The widely debated bill to regulate obscenity on the Internet passed 
through the United States Senate Wednesday evening by a vote of 84-16.
This is also known as the 'Exon Bill' after its author, Sentator Exon.

Now it goes to the House of Representatives for debate and vote. I've
an idea that it will also get passed in the House, then go to President
Clinton for signature, and at each step of the way we will be bombarded
with messages asking us to email/phone the appropriate people. Eventually
President Clinton will sign it into law -- after receiving a huge volume
of email in protest -- and then the ACLU and others will file legal
challenges to it with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will sit on
it for awhile, and finally announce that the law is constitutional. And
that, as they say, will be that.

You must know that if this passes the House of Representatives, President
Clinton *won't dare* veto it. He is in enough hot water as it is with
Whitewater, and if he and Hillary have not been indicted by the time the
next election comes around (rumor has it she already has been indicted),
he is going to need to kiss and makeup with all the various Christian
Coalition people, the Contract With America people and the rest of them.
He changes directions the same way the blowing wind changes directions,
and he owes *those people* a lot if he does not want to get put out of
office next year. So once Exon/Decency passes the House, it'll be all 
over except for the signing of the bill (count on it!) and the usual court
challenges, etc. (count on those also!). 

I guess we will learn to live with it.

I believe you are asking the wrong question. What happens when EVERY

revealed that Nynex, Bell Atlantic, and Pacific Telesis are laying
plans to bundle 64Kbps Internet service as part and parcel of ISDN. In
other words, if you have a telco ISDN line, you will be able to
connect to the Internet as easily and cheaply as calling the Time
Lady. This offering is projected to start up within eighteen months.

You may have noticed that the big ISPs: Netcom, PSI, and the like have
stopped providing part-time SL/IP connections. This would be the very
product that would be targeted by the telcos and the cable companies,
and there is no way on Gawd's Green Earth that ANY of them could
compete with a common carrier such as an LEC or a cable TV company.
The smaller companies will probably be hurt big time by this, as most
of them do a large part-time SL/IP business.

There is another issue that has not been addressed. With a part-time
Internet connection, one still needs a mail drop and DNS (if he even
has a static address or addresses). Given the RBOCs marvellous history
of attention to fine detail in non-telecom enhanced services, there
could be a gaping hole in their plans to offer part-time Internet
services.

(Leaving the connection up full-time could be expensive. Pacific Bell
charges for local usage during business hours, even on residential
ISDN.  People needing full-time Internet services will still need an
ISP that provides dedicated access through leased lines.)

Remember, "content is the key". Carriers such as the RBOCs realize
that the most profitability in the future will come from being the
provider of the "program" rather than just the transport agent. ISPs
have demonstrated demand and marketability of the Internet. It would
only be expected to have the RBOCs say, "Thanks, guys. Now if you
would just kindly step out of the way so we can take over your
business, we would be most appreciative." In this case, it would
appear that the cable TV companies have a shot at this market as well.

The days of small ISPs are numbered.

When they talk about running 10Mbps ethernet over regular cable TV, my
first thought is have they looked at the condition of a lot of the
cable in this country. My second thought is how many customers are
going to be sharing each loop. 10Mbps is fast, but not if I'm sharing
it with 1000 people. My third thought is that they're going to need a
lot more technical sophiscation in their local service.

I have to regard having a lot of little ma and pa internet access
providers as a temporary aberration of the market. There will be a lot
of consolidation down the road, but that might be five years or so
away.  Right now a lot of the little guys are offering more value for
the money.  With my local IAP I get unlimited 14.4 PPP for $15 a
month. Also keep in mind that a lot of places you can call up the
phone company and have a 128kb ISDN link put into your home. And you
aren't sharing that with anybody. ISDN is already good enough for a
lot of things and it will get better. Most of the local access will
move to ISDN eventually. There will be a big shakeout and most of the
business will belong to a few big nationwide providers.

If I had to bet, I'd bet that the cable companies are going to
standing around and figuring what to do, while the Direct Broadcast
Satellite, the wireless cable and the phone companies steal their
business out from under them.

This is the most complete work on the World Wide Web that I have seen
to date.  It definitely contains more information than other works on
the topic.  Be aware, however, that the content quality is not
consistent throughout.
 
Parts one and two are the usual introduction both to the Internet, and
to Web browsers.  Coverage of browsers is broader than most (although
not as exhaustive as, say, "The Complete Idiot's Guide to the World
Wide Web" (cf BKCIGWWW.RVW)).  The discussion of different programs
has, though, little analysis.  Mosaic is presented as "not the only"
browser, but its weaknesses in handling email and forms are not
mentioned.
 
Part three gives some very insightful tips on W3 concepts, operation
and use.  Searching techniques and tools are only part of the scope of
what should be required reading for serious Web users.
 
Part four is the obligatory list of Web sites, complete with
page-filling screen shots from each.  The material on education,
science, communications and government brings up a lot of new content.
Part five, on Web design and creation, may be considered overlong for
those wanting to plan a simple W3 server.  The "case study" indicates
that a project of larger scope is envisioned, and, from that
perspective, there is a lot of valuable material here that you will
not find elsewhere.
 
Part six, on future trends, is disappointing.  Two chapters touch on
security and its importance to commercial use of the net.  Neither
addresses the inherent security loopholes of the Web, nor the
difficulty imposed by the fact of two competing encryption technologies.  
(Nor, indeed, the use of technologies in a "World Wide" system where
one country refuses to let secure systems be exported, while others
simply refuse to allow their citizens encryption at all.)
 
Certainly quite comprehensive, and extremely valuable in places, there
are still some holes to be plugged, and repetitive sections that should 
be reduced.

Subject: CO/Boston New Hampshire Billing Errors
Date: Wed, 14 Jun 1995 17:09:26 EDT


After reviewing my most recent CO/Boston bill, I noted an odd problem.

In April, I placed a one-minute call in the SID 01485 system of New
Hampshire.

This system is a "partnership" system between both Cell One/Boston and 
Cell One/VT (Atlantic Cellular.) To the best of my knowledge, it is the 
only system in the country which is jointly operated by two carriers on 
each of their respective switches. 

Initially, roaming was crazy: Customers who belonged to the 01485 
partnership service paid different rates depending on who's tower they 
were connected to. Thus, a 01485 system customer who was billed from 
CO/Boston, would receive one rate (lower) for use of Boston towers, and 
another (higher) rate for use of CO/VT towers! This was quickly remedied 
for all 01485 customers, and they presently enjoy a unified rate 
throughout their service area in NH.

However, until about a year ago, roamers were still faced with the 
question (or impossibility) of knowing when they were on a CO/Boston 
tower and when they were on a CO/VT tower. If they were on a CO/Boston 
tower, they paid "New England Network" rates (.44 peak, .29 off-peak.) If 
they were on a CO/VT tower, they would pay $3 per day, .99 per minute, 
and CO/Boston's (then $2) and now $4 *outrageous* "Roamer Administration 
Fee", which is nothing less than a pathetically transparent attempt to 
gain as much revenue out of their higher-volume customers as they can.

After I (and doubtless others) complained that this was inherrently
unfair, ie, we had no idea of knowing when a call came in or when placing
an outbound call what rate I would be paying, CO/Boston reduced rates in
the CO/VT section of the New Hampshire 01485 (ONLY) system, and now the
rates reflect New England Network prices in all of SID 01485.  (But be
careful not to hit a CO/VT 00313 tower, which covers the rest of western
NH, VT, northern MA, and eastern upstate NY. If you do, as a Boston
customer, you'll be hit with $3.00 per day, $4.00 roamer admin, and $.99
per minute fees for a 1 minute call! [Hey Southwestern Bell, you want to
tell me how come we pay *EIGHT DOLLARS* for a one minute call on SID 00313
in VT when the SAME call on the SAME switch on the SAME system, which
happens to be on a SID 01485 tower costs only 29 cents? I'd love to hear
the explanation for this (rest assured, they don't have one other than
greed...)]

However, on my most recent bill, a two minute call in the New Hampshire 
01485 SID resulted in the full roam charge "barrage", that is, $3.00 day 
and $4.00 roamer admin fee. The actual roaming rates for the call were 
New England Network, but the billing system for some reason billed the 
call with the full $7.00 roamer surcharge. (Note that the $4 is per 
month, ie, if you roamed elsewhere outside the NE Network, even in another 
SWBell Market, you will pay that per month, but only once for any given 
month.)

If you note this $7 roaming charge on your bill, and you haven't roamed 
outside of the New England Network (which includes New York (00025), CT 
(00119), the 00119 sections of CT but NOT Franklin County (now owned by 
CO/VT, 00313), Rhode Island (00119), NH 00345, NH 01485, and I believe 
Vanguard/ME 00499 (or is it the 00501 system?), then you should refuse to 
pay BOTH the $3 daily charge, and the $4 roamer admin surcharge. DO NOT 
let them tell you that the $4 charge is for roaming "somewhere else", 
and DO point out to them that you have not been "somewhere else". 

To their credit, CO/Boston customer service is quite friendly and polite, 
but, unfortunately, they seem to use this "amiability" to persuade 
unaware customers that the roamer admin $4 charge should stay, because 
"you must have roamed somewhere else". DEMAND (politely) to know where 
and when. 

CO/Boston simply loves to nickel and dime it's customers -- from charging 
airtime for voicemail (so much so that they created a system so landline 
callers will also have to pay airtime to deposit messages in a cellular 
mailbox through the voicemail port instead of dialing the cellphone 
direct), to charging $1 per bill for a "call detail" -- a decreasingly 
rare billing item in the cellular industry today, to charging roamer 
prices anywhere outside it's nearby coverage area, and of course the $4 
roamer administration fee. These petty policies are bad enough without 
allowing them to get away with billing these charges for calls which do 
NOT warrant them. Check your bills!

Note that NYNEX, for all the flakiness of their utterly comical call
delivery network, provides similarly priced local service (no free
airtime as part of a regular, ongoing service plan, though), does not
charge you a local access fee for local calls, and does not try to
play games and insult the intelligence of its customers by levying
what appears to be a relentless series of additional charges.

When I think about CO/Boston's policies in this regard, I'm reminded of 
(and pardon the digression) one of the Warner Bros. "Looney Tunes" 
cartoons, where Porky, after a long night's drive, stops by a very 
modern looking hotel run by Daffy. Porky is very pleased to find that all 
he has to pay is one dime (10 cents) for a night's stay. After Porky goes 
to bed, Daffy releases a mouse into the room which noisily chews on 
celery and wakes Porky up. Porky complains, and Daffy immediately appears 
with a cat, who will chase away the mouse, for a mere $5 charge. Needless 
to say, the cat then creates a problem, and Daffy brings a dog (for 
$10), then a lion, an elephant, etc., all at substantially higher charges.

Somehow, I feel like Porky every time I get my Cell One/Boston bill! :(.

Someone at SWBMS must have been pretty dumb as a kid and never realized
that the cartoon was a JOKE, and not a model of a way to do business
(if you want to keep your customers). They got me with the free airtime
(which they've raised rates for anyhow), and now they do whatever else
they can get away with to make even more money. Prototypical greed, plain
and simple. 

It's too bad McCaw took over Nextel. Eventually, they or some other 
similar carrier would bury petty, miserly dinosaurs like CO/Boston, which 
is rapidly approaching runner-up position to by far the worst carriers in 
the nation: Los Angeles Cellular and PacTel/LA (yeah, yeah, "Airtouch" ...
whatever ...).

Subject: "Information Superhighway" - End of Local Loop
Date: Wed, 14 Jun 1995 14:32:19 -0700
From: David G. Cantor <dgc@ccrwest.org>


PacBell is introducing its "information super-highway".  In my area,
they expect it to be installed by the end of 1995 and they expect to
complete the installation for their part of California by 2010.

In a "dog and pony" presentation, PacBell stated that it will consist
of a fiber-optic link from the switch to a "box" serving 480 residences.  
Coaxial cable will leave the box, in a star network to individual
homes.  A small interface unit will be mounted at each home.  This is
a completely two-way network.

This system will, among other things, replace the local line loop. 
They do not expect much maintenance at the "box".  In particular the
constant search for available pairs for new services will end.  Extra
lines will be configured by software.

In addition to POTS, PacBell plans to provide both video service and
computer communications.

Subject: Design Project: Telephone Cost Meter
Date: 14 Jun 1995 05:00:19 -0400
Organization: Villanova University


Greetings, all ...

   In the fall I'll be building a telephone cost meter as a design
project for a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. Basically,
the device will accumulate the charges for long a distance phone call
and continually display the current cost while you're talking. Since I
have some extra time over this summer, I'd like to get started early.

   First and foremost, I need some way to estimate the per-minute cost
of a long distance phone call. With all the different calling plans
available, this could be a major headache. I contacted AT&T, and
someone was supposed to "get back to me" -- that was three months ago.
Next on my list is MCI ...

   I don't expect the cost algorithm to be exact, but I would like the
projected cost to be somewhat close (+- 10-20%) of the actual cost. My
goal is to have the most popular calling plans programmed in, and have
the user configure the telephone meter by selecting the plan/company
they use.

   In addition, I'd be curious as to what kind of "information" is 
available through the telephone wires, if any. For example, would the 
user need to program the area code where the call is being placed from, 
or is that somehow available from the telephone line itself(ala caller id)?

   The next order of business is the DTMF decoder. Granted, there are
many different brands available, but I can't seem to find a single
one. I have electronic catalogs from Mouser and DigiKey, but under
semi-conductors and IC's they have pages and pages of numbers, yet
none seem to correspond to the numbers I'm looking for. Using catalogs
(as opposed to textbooks) is new to me, and I appreciate any and all
the assistance I can get.  :-)

   I'm also looking for other cost meter devices which are already on 
the market. I've heard some rumors, but haven't been able to find 
anything. Just curious as to how they operate, and what people are 
paying for them.

So, in conclusion ...

   If you're at all familiar with how LD billing works, or know alot about 
phone technology in general, or feel you have some worthwhile 
suggestions -- please send me some e-mail!  :-)

   Oh, and BTW ... does anyone know if Stephen Bigelow, the author of 
"Understanding Telephone Electronics" has an e-mail address? 


Thanks in advance.

Jim

Read the article again, John.  The specifics are right there.

Due credit should be given Amway for marketing MCI services to its
constituency (and, yes, they still do), but I know of no one in the
investment community or telecommunications industry who considers
Amway's contributions as "responsible for MCI's success."  The
Drexel/Milken junk bond sale literally saved MCI's neck at a time when
conventional lending channels were closed to them.  Sales volume
didn't matter; they needed a capital infusion.  Most consider that
infusion to have been pivotal in MCI's continued existence (i.e.,
their salvation).

    "Twelve years ago, they had a cash shortage with billions of dollars 
of capital expenditures to make.  They had a clear understanding of what 
their business was.  We supplied them with billions of dollars of
capital..."

This, from Gilder's article, is quoting Milken.  Yet I know of no one in
either the investment or telecommunications industry who disputes this
description, as far as it goes.  (Effect on the fiber industry is
further described and important for other reasons, but not relevant to
the benefit the capital provided to MCI.)

In saying this, to use MCI as an example of a positive derivative of
Mr. Milken's work, which it indisputably is, should lend no moral weight
(either good or bad) to anyone's opinion of the man on a personal
level, nor any legal weight to whether he broke the law.  He was not
convicted of recognizing great potential and raising capital for it
(regardless of how that money was ultimately used by company
management), he was convicted of violating certain specific laws in
the process of doing that  (the end not justifying the means).  Most
people are emotionally mixing the issues.  Perhaps they failed to
note Gilder's very manner of pointing out the irony -- in the way he
started the description of the "evil Milken" and the way he ends it.

Not to speak for Mr. M., but we need to get a little humility instead
of righteous indignation: How many of us have never/would never "cut
any corners" when we see something we believe has tremendous potential
for so many people, but needs a boost to make it a reality?


Lynn Betts   4574792@mcimail.com


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Regards Amway/MCI, it is quite interesting
to me how things can get twisted around the more they get discussed. I've
heard a couple times in the past that Amway's assistance to MCI was more
than just the 'usual relationship between sales rep and company'. The
way it was explained to me, MCI was 'really very, very pleased with the
performance and bottom line as a result of Amway's efforts'. In other
words, its not that Amway 'saved' MCI, but that Amway was -- ummm -- let's
say well ahead of whoever is in third place on MCI's list of commission
agents. It is not that MCI couldn't have made it without Amway; just that
Amway made them a tidy little bundle of cash and continues to do so. There
is still plenty of work for the other sales reps at MCI; Amway just gives
the icing to the cake, or at least they used to.  Would that be a fair
assessment?   PAT]

Oh Barf!  Amway hacks will have you believing they've saved the world
just because they live here.  MCI agreed to provide discounts to Amway
resellers, and the next thing you know, Amway saved their business?
What does MCI need with all of their salespeople then?  With pros like
Amway, it should've sold itself right past AT&T in no time.

You want to run data communications over *unbalanced* telephone
cabling?  First, the line quality would be such that you would be
lucky to get a 212A modem to work reliably, because the crosstalk and
noise would be a huge component.  The huge longitudinal imbalance
would kill any attempt to use echo-cancelling modes of operation at
any speed.

We are talking transmission lines, designed to run in pairs with the
only ground being at the central office.

Frankly, installing your own wiring isn't that big a job.  There are
many sources for three-pair wire which can do the job just swell, and
you sound like you are already aware of the pitfalls of inside wiring.
The only thing that you would need to do that's out of the ordinary is
to buy a T-25 staplegun, the one with the round nose and the smaller
staples.  The T-50 is just too large and shoots square staples instead
of the T-25's round ones.

Further, try to avoid daisy-chain runs; use separate home runs and
bring them to a terminal block -- and then take a single run out to
the demark points.  Even better, if you can stand the cost, use 66M
blocks and, in the case of your data line, only put in bridge clips
for the jacks you use.  This limits the effect of the stubs.

The answer is No  but Maybe Yes....   

They could run what is called "subscriber line carrier"; that's running 
two lines down one wire.  They put a little box in your back room that
is self powered off the line and it will divide the two signals ...

You will still have to rewire your house with two pair wire or more.

Subject: Re: Will Cable Companies Dominate Internet Access Market?


        First off let me say that being a Telco employee does not mean I'm
knocking Cable for the benefit of my company.  These are purely practical
observations.

        IMHO, cable companies will only dominate those services where
speed and price are more important than reliability.  My opinion is
based on the fact that cable television's plant, at least in Austin,
TX, has never been built as if it were a critacal service.  And it's
still not being built to the same standards as telephone plant.  The
most obvious sign of this is in the fiber optic cable they are
currently installing around the city.  We (Southwestern Bell
Telephone) hardly ever place fiber aerially, but the cable company is
doing it almost exclusively.  What's more, the cable they are using
appears to be a single sheath design, about .5 inch diameter.  

        In my younger days I made my living as an outside repairman:
trees, squirrels, kids with pellet rifles, etc. are going to tear this
stuff up.  In the one case I have seen of aerial fiber placed by us,
the cable on the pole was nearly two inches in diameter.  Under a
U-gaurd coming down the pole to a buried conduit, the outer sheathes
were removed, leaving an inner cable the same size as what the cable
company was putting up on the poles!

        I have a question for the group in general: cable is not my
career so perhaps someone can tell me HOW cable is going to deliver
all the wonderous things they promise.  I know that cable has a HUGE
bandwidth, but it's just huge, not infinite, and their facilities are
essentially single runs feeding large geographical areas. I do know
quite a bit about frequency and digital multiplexing, but I would
really be interested if someone could enlighten me or point me towards
a good reference source on the subject.

        One last question I have is how will security be addressed?
If, as I believe, cable plant is essentially a single route all the
way to the house, how can privacy of information be accomplished?  I'm
sure much can be done with digital encoding, but any coding can be
broken and I'd personally rather not have my communications accessable
from any house in the area.  Again, any info would be appreciated.

The European Union has been pondering this point for quite some time.
As far as I know, they now have to choose between the following two
solutions to provide universal phone service:

 - require that the original monopolistic operator provides universal
service. Other operators would have to pay access charges when accessing
this network, to compensate for the cost of universal service;

 - create a common "solidarity" fund that all operators must contribute to,
either financially, or by providing universal phone service.

        - Audio problem, even many system equipped with echo cancellor,
        echo occurance is common when the mic is being moved around by

        (Real time respond).

The above are my experience with roll-about and room system.  Just

1. That was "B" carriers only.  "A" carriers used a system called
   "Roaming America" or "Nationlink" that was activated differently, and
   somewhat more automatically, but at differing levels depending on
   both your home and remote service provider.  The code to activate
   it was *31.  But most "A" carriers now participate in the "North
   American Cellular Network" which is fully automatic.

2. Follow-Me-Roaming (a service of GTE Data Services Corporation) has
   been replaced by Follow-Me-Roaming-Plus.  This activates automatically
   when you enter a new area.  Some, but not all, home carriers may want
   you to dial "*78" once to initially activate it; others will have it
   initially activated by default.

Almost all "B" carriers now participate in Follow-Me-Roaming-Plus, and
calls can be delivered automatically essentially everywhere in the
U.S.  and Canada without any need to dial anything.

His partner did what any climber would do. He pulled out a cellular
phone and dialed 911.

A helicopter team was sent.

screens can also show television news reports of whatever the disturbance

I'm not a lawyer, but I've been following the Prodigy case as closely
as I followed the Cubby/CompuServe case and, for what it's worth, here
is my opinion.

Prodigy is different from virtually every other service in that they
make an attempt to perform "prior restraint" on postings, similar to
the way that comp.dcom.telecom and other newsgroups are moderated in
NetNews.  In Prodigy's case, there are claims that they use software
to identify "suspect" messages, and a human being has to "OK" those
suspect messages before they can appear.  Not all details are
available right now, although anyone who can point to an electronic
archive with the case transcript will get a hearty "thank you" from
me.

In the case of CompuServe, other information service providers with
messaging services, and BBSes, the moderation is "after the fact", at
least for the regular users.  This means that a user, one vetted, can
in fact post freely -- the system operator can yank messages from view
only after they become public.  This is akin to a cork bulletin board
in which you can tack up your own messages.  Prodigy is more like the
cork bulletin board where you have to submit your message to the owner
and *s/he* tacks it up.

The Court held that Prodigy operates more like a newspaper or
magazine, where agents of the owner (editors) decide whether to
publish the item or not.  That active selection is why Prodigy is
liable for the statements of its subscribers.

If there is a lawyer in the house: are there any useful cites of
magazines and newspapers being sued for libel based on the publication
of a letter to the editor?

Won't work -- most switches will drop the call if you pulse-dial a
digit higher than three or four after the last digit of the called
number, because of the way they scan lines to tell when you've hung

Why should two keys do the same thing?  I'd rather see everybody
standardize on using # for enter (since it's to the right, where an
enter key would be expected) and perhaps * for escape.

I'll be spending about a week in Mexico this summer, and will be taking
a laptop/modem combination for connections from inside Mexico to 
destinations both inside and outside the country. I've a few questions:

1. How universal (if at all) is DTMF dialing, as opposed to pulse?

2. Can I expect to find RJ-11 jacks, wired the same as U.S. jacks, in
businesses, hotels, etc? If not, is there any particular color code
convention I should be aware of when hooking up my alligator clips?
That is, can I expect the red/green pair to work?

3. Any differences in line voltages, ring voltages, etc. that 
would make life difficult for the modem or computer?

4. Are there any "standard" dialing conventions such as "9" for
outside line, "1" before long distance numbers, etc.? 

5. Any recommendations on calling cards/procedures for making
long-distance calls within Mexico? (I plan to use AT&T USA Direct for
calls back to the States, but I've no clue how to best handle billing
for long-distance in-country calls.)

Thanks for any help,

Reply-To: thunt@fsg.com


We are using MFS Intelnet in New York as our local phone company.
Recently a customer calling us from Sweden told us that he tried
calling our main number and was getting a "number out of service"
message. He finally got through by calling our old (NYNEX) number
which we have forwarded to our new (MFS) number.

I told MFS about this and their response was that it was a problem
with the long distance carrier being used to call us and there was not
much they could do.

Somehow, I feel somebody needs to know to fix this. The question is
who?


Tim Hunt   tim@fsg.com


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Well, you can't call NYNEX, that's for
sure. You're not their customer any longer. (chortle!) Let me see if
I understand: when you went to MFS you got a new number? I had heard
that when you switched local companies it was supposed to be transparent;
that is, you got to keep your existing number. In other words, just like
portability with 800 numbers. So why did you give up your published,
well-known and (presumably) desirable number with NYNEX to begin using
a different number with MFS?  Or isn't how I have described the way it
works there?  Or if you did keep your established number and part of the
deal with MFS is that calls are being routed through it to the number(s)
that MFS set up for you, then why are you publicizing or giving out those
numbers used for call-forwarding purposes via your new local carrier?

Second, why would any other telco, domestic or international, care what
number was being called in New York?  I can understand that if MFS has
some 'new' exchanges in service that possibly other telcos around the
globe have not yet updated their tables to include the new prefixes or
exchanges, but otherwise I cannot imagine why they would care one way
or the other. Try these experiments:

   1. Use your MFS lines to dial your MFS number. Does the call go
      through? If you have more than one incoming line via MFS in
      a hunt group for example, attempt to dial into *each line*
      independently. Maybe calls hitting one of the back lines are
      not getting through because one of the back lines has a problem. 
      Anyway, if yes, an MFS line can be used to call *all* the other
      incoming MFS lines, then proceed to #2. If not, then the fault
      would seem to be in the MFS equipment somewhere.
  
   2. Now use a NYNEX line somewhere to dial your MFS number. Does
      the call go through?  If yes, then proceed to #3. If the call
      to your MFS number does go through from MFS but does not go through 
      when NYNEX is handling the call, then NYNEX is at fault.

   3. Try using NYNEX lines to dial two, three or more incoming 
      calls to your MFS lines *at the same time*. Then use NYNEX
      lines to try several calls at the same time to your NYNEX number.
      Any one or more of the calls get blocked or intercepted? 
   
   4. Have someone outside your area/areacode but sitll within NYNEX
      territory call your MFS number(s). Then have someone totally
      outside the territory, such as in Chicago or Denver try your
      MFS number then your NYNEX number. Know anyone else at some
      international point who can also try it?

Throughout all the above, please note *who* is giving the intercept 
message, if any occur. Is it an MFS or NYNEX recording?  If it is not
a recording from either of those companies, then neither one is at
fault. Is the 'not in service' recording coming from a local telco
somewhere who is not even passing the call (because their tables say
no such exchange/prefix exists in 212?) 

In 'normal' call forwarding from one line to another, you can dial either
the original number or the number it is forwarding to directly. I am not
sure in the new-fangled local competition schemes if you are *supposed*
to be able to directly address the 'forwarded-to' number or not. In
other words, the 'number' MFS assigned you may be only internal to their
system and used by agreement with NYNEX, but not a 'true' telephone number
for elsewhere. That's why it would be interesting to see if other long-
distance callers around the USA and the world experience the same results
as the Swedish people. 

Finally, there is the possibility that your Swedish customer dialed the 
wrong number. He transposed a couple digits (either because you gave him
the number incorrectly) or he wrote it down wrong, etc. Now he won't
admit it, or still does not realize that earlier he had it wrong. How
about some additional specifics from you on this?    PAT]

The service actually works quite well with answering machines; I have
never had any trouble with it.  It waits through the outgoing messsage
and waits for thre "record" tone. If you prefer, you can have a live
operator introduce the message.  You can also have the message
delivered only to the person you specify (ie not an answering machine,
and not to anyone else who might pickup the phone).

It's interesting that your callers have trouble with this; I've never been
given the 123 message unless I'm at a pay phone.  BTW, you can call
TrueMessages directly at 1-800-562-6275 to schedule messages, listen to

Subject: Pre-Paid Phone Card Questions
Date: 16 Jun 1995 00:10:18 GMT
Organization: Aiki International Software Services


Hello readers of the Digest,

A friend just called and said he was interested in getting in the
business of selling pre-paid phone cards via vending machine. I am not
sure why, but I can't help feeling that something would be amiss.

Apparently, long distance service providers large and small (small = 
resellers) will sell cards at say US 11 cents/minute, and you can then
resell them at what the market will bear.

I have a few questions about such an arrangement:

1) Are there some phone companies providing services that are, shall
we say, of dubious value?  Are some "here today/gone tommorrow"?

2) Do people really use these cards to save a few cents on calling
card surcharges?

3) If the answer to #2 is yes, do they buy new cards when the old one
is used up, or is it just a novelty? (I have been carrying a Sprint Five
Minutes Free promotion card for a year now "in case of emergency".
Come to think of it, it is about to expire this month, I better call
someone!)  This is important because the vending machines cost approximatly
US $2500, so you have to sell a lot of cards to recoup that investment.

4) If people do make regular use of these cards, who are they? Are
there some locations for the machines that have proved successful?
What are some successful pricing strategies?

5) Do various phone companies restrict the use of the cards to or from
particular areas, regions, or countries?

6) I would be interested in knowing from each of you why or why not
you would buy such a card.

7) Is there anyplace I can go to get more solid information about this topic?

I am too busy these days to promise to be able to read the Digest
regularly. I would appreciate if you e-mail your responses to me as
well as post them to the group. After a week or so, I can post a
summary to the group.


Thank you very much,

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: To answer just a few of your questions,
have you ever had to take a number and wait in line to buy one of those
cards?  I get around quite a bit to places where those cards are sold,
and I have yet to ever see anyone in line ahead of me asking to buy one.
I have waited in many lines for some non-related thing while the people
in line ahead of me were purchasing vast quantities of Illinois State
Lottery tickets, and in the places I frequent, the kind of people who
purchase large amounts of lottery tickets are the same people who would
be quite likely otherwise to use prepaid phone cards. If you were a 
reader of this Digest three years ago, you'll recall I assisted in the
promotion of one such card (the 'Talk Ticket') with the Digest readership
as my base of customers. It went nowhere fast. Any of you still around
who bought those and tried them out?  How about sharing some experiences
here now a couple years later?  

And no, they don't restrict where you can call except possibly you can't
use them for 900 numbers and it would be a waste of the card to use it
for 800 numbers. Why should they care where you call since they have
already been paid -- long ago in fact, by two earlier generations of
wholesalers/distributors/door-to-door salespeople who are now eager
to sell the card to you (and recoup their money) -- they have no potential
fraud and/or collection problem. In fact, you wind up paying the telco
more for giving them less headaches collection-wise. I liken prepaid
phone cards to American Express money orders: AMEX makes a killing on
those; in effect you loan Amex money they don't have to account for for
a few days until its time to pay off someone. Would *you* like to have
a float of a couple million dollars to play with on any given day?
And the shame is, they charge you an administrative fee of a dollar or
so on money orders; you pay them money on the money you loan them for
a few days or a few weeks until someone else cashes it in.  Any of you
want to loan me a million dollars just for a day? I'll return it to you
tomorrow *with interest*.  See my point?    PAT]

Dear Mr. Townson,

I have brosed through telecom previously, but we are not set-up for news
posting.  Please excuse me for this direct e-mail.

I am serving as a member for a commitee at Japanese PTT ministry.  At
this committee, we are about to write up the report, comparing the
telecommunication cost between Japan and the US.

As of now, DS-1 local hook-up (point to point at 0 km) costs us about
$4,000 US per month !!!  I have been trying to tell the ministry that
it is crazy, but they say they do not have any foreign data on local
hook-up, they cannot say anything in the report.

Is it possible for you to point me to the sources of this information
(price ranges for DS-1 local hookup, for example).  Or, better yet,
can you just tell me the cost ranges just off the top of your head ?

Comment from Europe:

Norway is quasi *obliged* to end the remaining Telenor monopolies:

Norway is a party to the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement.

The general principle of the EEA Agreement is that all European
Community (EC) directives and regulations concerning the internal
market apply not only to the European Union Member States, but also to
the EEA countries from the date of entry into force of the Agreement,
i.e. from January 1, 1994 (with a six-month transition period for
competition law).

The implication is that the EC's telecommunications liberalisation
directives became applicable in Norway on July 1, 1994.

The "Services Directive" -90/388/EEC-, as amended by Directive
94/46/EEC applies to Norway today and will be amended again in 1995 or
1996 in order to oblige the EC countries to enable competitive
provision of the voice telephony service and competition for the
establishment and operation of telecommunications infrastructures from
January 1, 1998 at the latest.

New measures in the telecommunications sector (for example the
forthcoming amendment to the "Services Directive") are considered for
adoption by the so-called EEA Joint Committee on a directive-by-directive 
basis. According to the EEA Treaty, the process of adopting directives
by the EEA requires ratification by the European Parliament as well as
by the parliaments of the individual EEA Member States (such as
Norway).

As you can see, Norway would have to take pretty radical steps in order to 
escape from mandatory demonopolisation of its telecommunications sector. It 
could either refuse to ratify a particular directive (which would lead
to high-profile court cases), or it could withdraw from the EEA.

I've been very interested in the emergence of competition for our local phone

How will the infrastructure be managed? Who will control it?

Will there be an exponential explosion in the number of overhead wires
as each company installs their own?

Will the current phone company remain "protector" of the infrastructure 
and simply resell capacity?

Will the current phone company be forced to GIVE capacity to the incoming

The only use of cell phone tracking in the Simpson case was to find OJ
during the ride in Al Cowlings bronco.  The issue of a cell phone call
originating from Nicole's house or OJ's is not relevant.

The use of a cell trace to find OJ was done in real time, not later as
'records' would infer.  Any good telecom tech with the right computer
could tell you which cell was serving a particular customer and signal
strength (to estimate distance from the cell).  Handoffs would be the
key to tracking, unless you put people on the street with directional
tracking devices.  Of course ANY INFORMATION is subject to being recorded 
at some point, but the reason of WHY would have to be answered.

Just my opinions.

There was a proposal some years ago in the Intelligent Transportation
world to use the cellular phone location information as a way to
determine feasible speeds along stretches of freeway. [Essentially,
the reasoning system would infer "Phone X got from cell 1 to cell 2 in
Y minutes, so therefore the feasible speed for that piece of the
freeway network is at least Z mph".] I think that the system would
work provided the phone was turned on, regardless of whether calls
were made or not.

The problem there is that cell coverage overlaps to some extent (it
has to in order to assure uninterrupted calls as you travel), and it's
sometimes possible to hit different cell sites from points only a few
feet apart.

A decision is to be made very soon, but until then one can only
speculate.  The scenario you describe does resemble an interview given
by Telia Mobitel's managing director about a month ago (Mobitel is
Telia's telecom-over-radio division).  Telia's been pushing very hard
for DCS since that would leave their analog NMT900 system in the
clear.  They were hoping that NMT would be left intact and that the
future GSM customers would have to buy dual-mode handsets.

France Telecom is one of the actors that wants DCS freq's in Sweden
but they don't want to give Telia access to DCS because of Telia being
the dominant player on the Swedish market.

Now here is were the interesting part is.  According to my knowledge
there exists no GSM/DCS networks in the same country with roaming
between them, ie capcaity roaming.  Would that be in contrast to what
you say 1-2-1 (& Orange) achieved in the UK?

If there were five Swedish DCS licenses and licenses one through three
went to Telia, Comviq and Europolitan (Swedish GSM operators) how would you 
compete?

The aim seems to be to give current GSM operators an ability to offer
only capacity but not a full (nationwide) DCS service.

Maybe that's what's going to happen in Sweden to ...

Sweden has some 750 000 NMT900 users (Telia monopoly) and 500 000 GSM
users.  A total of 800 000 phones are expected to be sold during 1995.
Between 600' and 700' of those'll be GSM.  Sweden also has some 250
000 NMT450 users but they aren't affected freq reallocations.  Sweden
has 8.5 M inhabitants.

Subject: FCC Acts to Conserve 800 Numbers


On June 13, 1995, AT&T, MCI, Sprint, LDDS Worldcom and other Resp Orgs
across the country were notified that as of June 14, 1995, 12 AM, the
FCC ordered the 800 National Database to limit the number of 800
numbers a Resp Org can assign collectively to reserve or working
status, to two hundred (200) per week.
 
Additionally, the total amount of reserve numbers cannot exceed 3% of
the Resp Org's working numbers.  The prior limit was 15%, and not
surprisingly, most Resp Orgs are well over the limit.
 
This has effectively disabled the carriers, at least for the moment,
and appears on its face to acknowledge the role the Resp Orgs have
played in the current 800 "shortage."
 
Compliance with this order is to begin at 12:01 am eastern time,
Wednesday, June 14, 1995, and continue until further notice from the
Commission.  The SMS is required to provide, by fax, a daily report on
800 number consumption to the FCC, including the total daily activity
of each Resp Org.  The first report is to contain the consumption
activity of each Resp Org from the week of June 5, 1995.
 
This office has obtained a copy of two letters from Kathleen Wallman,
Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau, to Michael Wade, president of
Database Service Management, Inc., one dated June 9, the other, June
13, 1995.
 
In the first, Ms. Wallman states that a temporary suspension of
processing and granting new or pending Resp Org applications will
assure that Resp Orgs won't be able to "clone" themselves in order to
reserve more 800 numbers and thus accelerate exhaust.
 
She finishes, "By issue of this letter, we direct Database Service
Management, Inc. (DSMI) to cease the processing and granting of
Resp Org applications as of 12:01 am, June 12, 1995.  We require DSMI
to inform Resp Orgs with pending applications who have not (1) returned
the necessary forms to DSMI; (2) received a credit check; and (3)
obtained the proper insurance, that further processing of their
applications will be suspended for six months."
 
In the second letter dated June 13, Ms. Wallman reveals how "the
industry" has been working with her office to explore alternatives
ensuring a smooth transition from 800 to 888 numbers for toll-free
calling.  These alternatives include acceleration of 888 deployment
and strengthening tariff language to prevent "warehousing."
 
She concludes, however, that the problem is accelerated depletion on
the part of Resp Orgs, and orders that the Database Service
Management, Inc. limit to two hundred per week the amount of 800
numbers a Resp Org may assign collectively to either "working" or
"reserve" status.
 
She does permit the DSMI to increase in any one week a Resp Org's
assignment by 25% of the amount of numbers it returned to "transition"
status.  If that same Resp Org does not return numbers the next week,
its assignment will return to two hundred numbers.
 
Additionally, the "aging process" is reduced to four months, measuring
the four month period from the date when a Resp Org returns an 800
number to the SMS database and marks the number "disconnected."
Finally, all 800 numbers currently assigned to the "transition" state
are ordered returned to the 800 number "pool" immediately.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It sounds like people with 800 numbers
may soon have a very valuable commodity by virtue of having an 800
number. Judith, when you get further information or memorandums on this
I hope you will pass them along.    PAT]

When I saw the title, I figured it would be about LANs.  When I saw
the cover, and the fact that one of the authors is the founder of
Traveling Software, I figured it would be documentation for LapLink.
It's neither.
 
The book covers all kinds of ways to link personal computers.  This
includes transfers over serial and parallel ports, printer sharing,
"A-B" switches, LANs (briefly), modems, PCs and Macs, wireless links,
and "little tiny computers" (PDAs, palmtops and such).
 
My initial reaction as a data communications specialist, was that the
book is sometimes shy on details.  The more I read and thought about
it, though, the more I realized that the authors have struck a very
good balance in providing just enough information.  With the range of
topics covered, and the small size of the book, this makes an
excellent resource for non-specialists who need to get data from one
machine to another.  Indeed, because of the breadth of discussion, I
suspect many technical support people could use this work, while it is
easily readable for the beginning user.
 
For anyone who needs to get a file from Machine A to Machine B, a good
starting point.

Today a call can be made from one end of the country to another for
less cost than a local call at a pay phone. Why is it, then, that I
afford my wife such rich amusement by the lengths to which I will go
rather than return a long distance phone call?  My irrational
prejudice about the expense of long distance was fixed back in the
dark ages, when it *was* relatively expensive.  It was common
practice, when leaving friends or relatives on a long trip, to place a
collect call to those one had left once one had arrived at the
destination.  They wouldn't accept the call, naturally, but would
understand that you had arrived safely.  This was sometimes known as
"code calling".  Such practice was, of course, a form of fraud.  Phone
companies generally now have tariffs to avoid it, such as a minimum
charge on collect calls, whether they are accepted or not.
 
International callback arises from the fact that a call from country A
to country B may cost the user up to twice as much as a call placed
from country B to country A.  The United States generally has much
cheaper long distance charges than other countries.  Companies are now
starting to make use of this fact, and different types of code
calling, in order to reduce the overall costs of international long
distance traffic.
 
(Despite the security link, "International callback" has no relation
to "call back verify", a practice of calling a user back at a
pre-determined number in order to authenticate identity.)
 
Retske's book covers all aspects of the field, examining not only the
technical problems and solutions in the callback process, but also the
establishment and marketing of a company transacting such a telecommunica-
tions business.  The costs and benefits for users are analysed, and
the legal, political, and social aspects are discussed as well.  An
intriguing argument for the validity of the operation is based not
merely on "free market" principles, but on the fact that those
entities most opposed to callback are the ones responsible for the
disparity which drives its use.

Subject: Manual Exchanges - Historical Question
Date: 19 Jun 1995 02:36:44 GMT
Organization: PACS IBM SIG BBS


Does anyone have any experience with manual telephone exchanges,
either as a user or telco person?  (Manual exchanges are where all
calls were handled by an operator.  The last AT&T location was Santa
Catalina Island off Calif in the 1970s.  By the early 1960s, manual
exchanges were rare, but many existed.)

I'm curious as to typical times to get an operator, whether small
towns used the A/B board arrangement, and how many operators were
required.  I wonder today how many operators would be on duty to
handle say a 20,000 line suburban exchange.

In the Philadelphia PA area, I understand the last manual exchange was
Upper Darby (just outside the city), FLanders.

[I've read some stuff about this, but I'm seeking personal experiences.]


Thanks.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: There were variances in the types of
switchboards used, with no specific consistency as to what would be
found in any specific town. Very small towns had but a single operator's
position while larger towns had several positions. 

Generally, manual service was as fast as automated service is today. That
is, the operator was present on the line within a few seconds and the
connection was made within a few seconds more. I suppose today with the
prevalence of touchtone, it is faster today, but when the conversion from
manual to automatic dialing was going on, rotary dials were the standard,
and ten or fifteen seconds devoted to dialing the number was common. In
that context then, manual service was about the same since you generally
went off hook and got ringing from wherever you were calling within about
fifteen seconds most of the time. 

The key to the speed was in the way the operators were trained. (Yes, I
know that sounds odd, but years and years ago the Bell System *did* offer
training to new operators instead of like now, where they sometimes have
twenty-one year old supervisors overseeing the work of operators with
twenty-one year's experience.) An operator not handling a call sat with
a cord in her hand, ready to slam it into a jack when one became illumin-
ated. The lamp would light when the calling party went off hook, *not
when he got the phone to his ear*. Therefore, the operator had a one or
two second head start. Frequently when you got the phone to your ear the
operator was there asking 'number please'. In a medium size or larger
community, your telephone line was multipled on the switchboard; that is,
it terminated on several jacks at various operator positions, each of which
would illuminate simultaneously. This allowed any operator who was free to
handle the call. The first operator answering caused the light to go out
and other operators would go on to other subscribers instead. 

The operators generally worked in groups of three, meaning your line 
appeared on a jack every third position. About one-third of the exchange
showed up on each position, with one third on the position to your left
and one third on the position to your right. Then there would be three
more operators with the same arrangement, and on through the room. Between
the three operators, they had about 1500-1800 jacks; maybe 500-600 each.

In addition to the five or six hundred jacks directly in front of your
face, along the top of the switchboard were jacks going (a) to other
positions around the room, (b) to other exchanges around the city, (c) to
long distance operators, and (d) the supervisors, chief operators, etc.
If the call you picked up involved another subscriber within your own
switchboard, you simply made the connection by taking the tip of your
cord and touching it to the sleeve of the jack to 'test for busy', and
hearing a 'tick' completing the connection by plugging in the cord and
ringing. You had to 'test for busy' because another operator down the
line somewhere might have already plugged into that subscriber's jack
with a call. If you plugged in also, you'd cause an unwanted 'conference'
call between the two callers to the called party, etc. If you did not
hear the 'tick' then the line was in use by someone and you responded
to the caller 'line is busy', and disconnected. If the line was not busy,
that is you got the tick noise then when you plugged in one of two things
happened: on older switchboards the operator would toggle a small switch
or 'key' associated with the cord pair in use to ring on that line. On
newer switchboards, the ringing occurred automatically. A lamp on the
switchboard associated with the cord pair in use told the operator when
either the called or calling party had hung up the receiver, and this
was the signal for the operator to pull down the associated cords. The
cords were spring-loaded in the base of the switchboard; all the operator
had to do was pull it from the jack and let go; the cord would fall back
to its resting place automatically. 

If the requested connection was in a third of the exchange handled on
either side of you, then you reached in front of the operator to your
left or right and connected on *that position* in the same way as on
your own, but using your own cords so that you would get the 'supervision
lamp' notification when the call was finished. Since operators were 
expected to handle a large number of calls, it was necessary for them to
'overlap'. That meant that they often handled more than one call at a 
time. For example, an operator might be writing up information on a toll
ticket or speaking with a subscriber about something trying to help them
and she would notice (during this operation) that another call had been
finished because the supervision lamps for that cord pair had lighted.
While still talking to the one customer she would reach up and yank down
the cords for the other (now concluded) call. If the concluded call was
to a jack on the position to your left or right, making it impossible to
reach while still attempting to write a toll ticket for a new call you
were handling, you simply tugged the cord a little; the operators looked
out for each other and when your neighbor-operator saw you tug a cord 
that was plugged in in front of her, she would reach up and pull it out
for you. When she pulled it out, the cord would jump back in your 
direction and fall in its slot to await further use. Each position 
generally had fifteen cord pairs -- although some had twenty -- meaning
the operator could handle fifteen calls at once, which was almost always
enough. 

If the connection requested was to a number not on your switchboard or
that of the operator to your immediate left or right, then the operator
would plug into one of the jacks on the top of her switchboard which 
connected to the switchboard where the requested number *could* be found. 
When the corresponding jack illuminated elsewhere in the room or in the
city, the operator at that end would respond. Likewise, in our illustration
here, our operator would also respond to inbound from those jacks on the
top. But unlike the other jacks on the main part of the switchboard where
the operator responded 'number please', on inter-position and inter-exchange
calls the responding operator simply plugged in. A slight but discernable
'tick' told the originating operator that the responding operator had
come on the line. 

Normally on a call handled within your own switchboard or the positions
to your left or right, after asking 'number please' and taking your
request, the operator simply tested, then plugged in, or told you the
line was busy. Once plugged in and the ringing started, the operator would
respond 'thank you' and leave the line. If the call had to be passed 
inter-position or inter-exchange then the dialogue was a little different.

Operator: Number please?
Caller:   Edgewater 509  (or somewhere other than where they were).

As soon as the operator heard the exchange name, she was *already reaching
up and plugging into a jack for the Edgewater exchange* at the same time
you were reciting the rest of the number (five oh nine). She would hear
the tick, meaning some operator at the Edgewater office had responded.

Originating operator:  five oh nine.

Silence for a second or two from the other end, then either ringing or
the other operator would respond 'line is busy' and disconnect. The
operator was not reciting the number back to you to confirm it was
correct, she was passing it to the other operator for connection. Once
the ringing started at the other end your operator would then say 'thank
you. If the call went unanswered, then either the distant operator would
eventually pull the cord first causing your operator to get a disconnect
signal on the supervision lamp or your operator would see that you had
abandoned the call from the same supervision lamp and she would pull the
cord causing the distant operator to see the disconnection and pull hers
also.  

If a subscriber had more than one line, then all the jacks for his various
lines would be in a cluster; all marked as being the same subscriber. The
caller would ask for the main number like now, but seeing a cord in place
in that jack (or testing positive for busy on the first jack in the series)
the operator would just keep working her way down the line, cord tip to
jack sleeve until one of the lines in the 'hunt group' tested not busy.
If all were busy, she would respond 'line is busy'. If a subscriber left
his phone off the hook accidentally or on purpose, a 'dummy plug' was used
to shut off the lamp or the common audible buzzer slower offices used at
night when there were intervals of a minute or two between calls. 

If you did not pay your phone bill, the business office had a special
'dummy plug' they would insert in the jack at one of the positions which
grounded out the line in such a way that to the subscriber going off hook
the line was 'dead' (no battery) and an operator trying to ring it would
never be able to do so. When you paid up -- if you did -- the business
office would pull out the dummy plug so normal service was resumed. 

When speaking to each other, the operators used abbreviations for the
longer phrases they used when speaking with subscribers. When talking to
another operator (instead of a customer) the operator would say:

  DA  (the line does not answer)
  BY  (the line is busy)
  NC  (there are no circuits available to that exchange now)
  OD  (the line is out of order)
  NS  (no such number or such a number but not in service, not assigned).
  BD  A business office denial of service; a credit disconnect, but this
      was not considered to be something to be told to other subscribers 
      who were told instead 'I am unable to connect you to that number now.'

The fast and speedy service in the days of manual exchanges was predicated
like today on the assumption that at any given time only two or three 
percent of the subscribers would want to make a call. Having five to ten
percent of the subscribers off-hook at the same time then like now was
considered a very busy period; then like now, fifteen to twenty percent of
the subscribers was the most the system could handle; it maxxed out at 
that point. Following an earthquake, declaration of war, natural disaster,
whatever, then like now the response was slow. Now we wait for dial tone
and encounter 'no circuit' conditions following some major event. In the
manual service days it was the same way, and delays waiting for an operator
could be up to two or three minutes, even five minutes on rare occassions. 
Then like now, calls were withheld from affected areas as needed. If for
some reason the subscribers in a given office got into an uproar about
something and the traffic was unusually heavy there, word would soon reach
other exchanges where instructions would be given to withhold traffic from
the affected office until the operators there were able to get their boards
under control once again. 

I didn't think I was ever going to stop writing this, did you?  <g>  PAT]

Subject: Computer Viruses Banned from Finnish Internet
Organization: Turun yliopisto =B7 University of Turku, Turku, Finland
Date: Mon, 19 Jun 1995 12:34:33 GMT


The Ministry of Traffic and Communications banned last week Internet
service providers and their customers from offering computer viruses
publicly online. There has recently been one test case with the "2806
viruses pack" available on a WWW page, and this is finally an official
resolution which was requested by the various organisations with
interests in the Internet. This case of viruses online was viewed as
quite controversial in the press.

The license to disconnect offending parties is rather strict on this
matter: any Internet service provider who does not comply may be
disconnected at once. Any telecommunications provider who does not
comply in disconnecting the ISP in turn may be disconnected itself
by order of the MTC.

There are about 50 local and national telecoms in Finland; 5 to 10
major ISPs; and many small BBS scale Internet systems throughout the
country.

Note: it still remains legal to create and distribute viruses _privately_ 
whereas in Britain programming also has been banned.

network?________ Where (USA or European Country)? _________________ If you
have done this, did it work well? ___________________

7) Is the availability of services such as noted in question number 5,
likely to make you use payphones more often? _____________

8) In Europe, are you generally (more, less, or same) satisfied with
payphone service today than 5 years ago?___________________________

9) Does your home country currently have a commercial PCS (micro-cellular)
service available? ____________________

significantly changed your use of  payphones? ____ If yes, has it
increased or decreased your use of payphones? ______________

15) In Europe, has your use of a pager phone (if you use one)
significantly changed your use of  payphones? ____ If yes, has it
increased or decreased your use of payphones? ______________

16) Are all of the payphones in your country installed and operated by
your country's primary telephone administration (PTT)? ______________ If
your answer is no, what percentage would you estimate is operated by them?
______________ Who else operates payphones in your country? ___________

17) What percentage of your payphones (estimate) will accept coins only?
__________ What percentage of your payphones (estimate) will accept debit
or credit cards only? ______________  What percentage (estimate) will
accept both coins and debit or other credit cards?_______

18) Any comments that might be useful for purposes of the study, but which
I neglected to ask (for example, are you aware of any published material
on payphones)?

Subject: India Worries About National Security and Private Telecom Nets


--==(C) Copyright 1995 Rishab Aiyer Ghosh (rishab@arbornet.org)

19th June 1995: According to a report from the Parliamentary Standing
Committee on Communications, India's Department of Telecommunications
(DoT) has recommended the "ultimate remedy of a government takeover of
[a private telecom] network in case of circumstances arising out of
internal disturbances and sabotage."

The government, paranoid about the foreign companies who will own as
much as 49% of a telecom operator, worries that the networks may
conduct unauthorised wiretaps, presumably on behalf of evil Western
intelligence agencies. Such interception could, according to the
Parliamentary Committee, "pose a grave threat to the nation as well as
infringe on the privacy of citizens."

Today I spoke to Telecom Secretary R K Takkar about the security
criteria included in the tender document for the provision of basic
telecom services (publicly available, but for $3,000). Mr Takkar said
that the decision to impose the "ultimate remedy" will be made by the
government, as it comes under statutory powers that are not being
transferred to the independent Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.
As the government has also retained the powers to licence operators,
and is the contracting party, the private telecom networks explicitly
agree to these terms.

In fact, the "ultimate remedy" is included in the tender document, as
are other requirements, on the whole reasonable. For example, foreign
personnel working on installations or maintenance would need prior
security clearance.  Operators would provide access to switching and
transmission centres, and intercept traffic for the authorities. They
could only install "approved" encryption equipment, such as that
required for GSM cellular (the private use of encryption has not been
mentioned).

Incidentally, Indian courts do not issue warrants or accept wiretaps
as evidence, giving the police little incentive to intercept. Moreover, 
all wiretaps are illegal, except in exceptional circumstances. Whatever 
wiretaps are carried out are conducted informally by agencies such as
the Intelligence Bureau -- reputedly the world's oldest spook agency
still active -- and the victims are opposition politicians.  Every
decade or so a few cases come to light, are furiously debated in
Parliament, and declared illegal. As they never reach the courts --
which would probably concur -- there are no legal precedents, only
predictions.

Await a detailed story on telecom and security in the second issue of
my newsletter. The first, which includes coverage of the proposed
regulatory authorities for communications and broadcasting, will be on
the Net later this month.

Subject: India's Telecom Workers Go on Strike


--==(C) Copyright 1995 Rishab Aiyer Ghosh (rishab@arbornet.org)

19th June 1995: Three employees federations representing 450,000
telecom workers nationwide went declared an indefinite strike today in
protest against the government's privatisation programme. Negotiations
with Minister for Communications Sukh Ram went on till late on Sunday
evening, but were unsuccessful.

The unions claimed that the strike would not affect telephone
subscribers, and that their protest was only against some "deviations"
from the government's National Telecom Policy, which called for
private investment.  Still, operations in the few manual exchanges
remaining in small towns may be disrupted, as may any maintenance
work.

Telecom workers, from the Department of Telecommunications monopoly as
well as ITI, a public sector equipment manufacturer, object to the
compulsory foreign investment criteria in the tender for basic and
cellular services, of which the bids were announced earlier this
month. This is implicit in the requirement of prior operational
experience -- which private Indian companies, naturally, do not have,
with the result that all the bids are joint ventures with a foreign
stake of up to 49%.

The government is not considering changing its policies. Instead, it
has declared the strike illegal, and has asked states to take action
on the basis of the Essential Services Maintenance Act.

An exclusive report on India's telecom liberalisation and planned
regulatory authority -- based on an interview with the Telecom
Secretary -- will be found in my newsletter, out on the Net later this
month.

Subject: FCC Regulations For Cellular E911 


The FCC is currently in the process of formulating regulations for the
wireless industry on access to E911.  The FCC realized that current
systems are incapable of reporting the location of the cellular caller
to the emergency call taker.  In many cases, the cellular caller
doesn't even know what highway they are on, no less pinpointing a
location to allow emergency response.

An extensive task force, sponsored by the Personal Communications
Industry Assocation Technical and Engineering Committee, filed
detailed comments on the FCC Notice of Proposed Rule Making.  Several
industry meetings, sponsored by both PCIA and CTIA, were previously
held.  The PCIA task force also looked at suitable technologies to
provide the geolocation accuracy requested by the public safety
community.

The FCC NPRM proposed a phased in approach over five years.  In the
initial phase, cellular (and other wireless common carrier systems
such as ESMR and PCS) would report the cell site or cell face via the
cellular switch, local switching infrastructure, and E911 tandems and
databases, to the emergency call takers position.  The call would be
routed to a predetermined call taking position.

In two steps, resolution of the geographic location to within several
hundred feet would be required over the five year period.

The FCC received a tremendous amount of comments from the industry on
this NPRM.  Apart from a few minor details, such as more than half of
the country does not even have E911, and that most cellular 911 calls
are routed to highway patrols rather than to the "nearest" PSAP, and
the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades to local
switching and database systems will have to be financed by local
communities, the FCC plans to move forward on this.

It is quite likely that some capability will be phased in over the
next few years, but many difficult obstacles remain to develop the
neccesary standards and interfaces to deliver the location information
from the cellular system, through the existing LEC network and 9-1-1
infrastructure and databases, to the existing, often uniquely
customized 9-1-1 answering centers.

Most cellular systems record at least the intial cell in which a call
was placed, as well as some record of cells traversed, to allow
maintence personnel to be able to troubleshoot complaints.  This is
part of the normal switch billing detail record.  This does not always
"locate" the caller to a specific location since calls can be
originated on other cells nearby due to propagation effects.

  From: Wendell Craig Baker <wbaker@splat.baker.com>

Remember the CompuServe flap over GIF of last January?  CompuServe
first came out and said that everyone had to get a license to use GIF.
Then as the flames rose they explained that they were only doing this
because Unisys required it for their compression patent.  Somehow they
had neglected to mention this at first, and had chosen a holiday
weekend to make their license requirements known.

In response various people proposed a new graphics format that was
unpatented.  CompuServe finally resolved the situation by promising to
return with a patent-clean graphics standard.  Then we heard nothing
from them.  Well, they're back with a new graphics standard in hand.
The press release announcing it follows.

COMPUSERVE(R) ANNOUNCES PNG-BASED GRAPHICS SPECIFICATION
Fully Open 24 Bit Graphics Capability for Electronic Graphics
Exchange

COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 15, 1995 -- CompuServe Incorporated today
announced the completion of a new 24-bit graphics specification that
was announced earlier this year.  This new, enhanced 24-bit lossless
specification will offer the professional graphics community a
significant enhancement to the earlier GIF 89a specification while
also eliminating the proprietary LZW software, replacing it with
compression technology compliant with the PNG (pronounced `ping')
specification.

        "The new specification is a true 24-bit lossless format that
will give users a 16 million color palette and represents a
significant enhancement over the previous GIF technology," said Tim
Oren, CompuServe vice president of future technology.  "More
importantly, this new specification has been created with tremendous
attention to making it free, open and rights clear so that anyone can
incorporate it into their products without fear of patent infringement."

        The new specification was developed as a collaboration between
CompuServe and several key communities: The Internet PNG group led by
Thomas Boutell, and including Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler, the
developers of Deflate and Inflate; and the CompuServe online graphics
forums (GO GRAPHICS). Ultimately, CompuServe's new graphics specification 
adopted compression technology that was based on the PNG specification.  
As a result of those efforts, CompuServe has determined that the PNG
format closely meets the future requirements for graphics interchange
on the Internet, on CompuServe and on other services.  Based on
current evaluation results, PNG will also be useful for exchange of
information between graphics software products

        "Earlier this year, there was a great deal of attention paid
to GIF on the Internet," continued Oren.  "Much of it was constructive
and served not only to move the 24-bit graphics project off the back
burner, but also gave us connections to the Internet team which helped
us create the new PNG-compatible graphics specification in only five
months.  This cooperative effort has benefited the whole online
community and should serve as a model for how the Internet's positive
and creative forces can be focused."

        PNG makes use of a data compression technology called
`deflation' used in the freeware Info-Zip programs.  CompuServe has
adopted the PNG format and is creating a free toolkit that will create
graphics meeting the PNG specification while avoiding patent concerns.
The toolkit will be available within the next few weeks.

        Though CompuServe will hold a copyright on the toolkit, it is
understood that its free distribution and use is encouraged and
expected.  To maintain the free and clear patent status of the new
specification, it will not be backward compatible with the current
GIF89a specification.  Adoption of the new PNG-based specification
will take place over time, allowing a smooth transition to the new
format.  CompuServe will also provide a conversion utility from GIF89a
to PNG for use in conjunction with the CompuServe Information
Services.  This utility will be available within the next few weeks.

        The CompuServe Information Service continues to be the world's
most successful and most popular online and Internet service with
millions of members who go online from more than 3.1 million active,
paying accounts in more than 150 countries.  The undisputed industry
leader in innovation, the service offers global email, the industry's
first CD-ROM supplement, libraries of free software, selected 28.8
kbps access and worldwide direct Internet access services.  For a free
introductory CompuServe membership, call 800-524-3388 and ask for
representative number 664, or access CompuServe's home page on the
World Wide Web (http://www.compuserve.com).

        In addition to the CompuServe Information Service, CompuServe
offers networking, Internet services, electronic mail and business
information services to major corporations worldwide.

        CompuServe is an H&R Block (NYSE: HRB) company.

                    About BUDAPEST

In 1835, an English peer by the name of John Paget got his first look
of Buda and Pest from the crest of Gellert Hill. Of what he saw there
he wrote as follows: "Buda with its blue chain of hills, Pest with its
yellow plain, and the majestic Danube with its green isles were all
sprawled out at our feet ... and we sat for some time, enthralled by
all that beauty. One hundred and fifty years have passed since the
ousting of the Turk, and in this space of time, the city has risen
from squalid ruins to become one of the great cities of Europe. Pest
owes its progress not to the good will of a benevolent ruler, but to
its natural endowments and the energy of its people. It lies on
the banks of a river that traverses half of Europe, and may expand
unbounded in every direction. All this leads one to anticipate a
splendid future for Pest-Buda."

 It is interesting to compare Paget's description with the observation
made by the geographer Kohl from Bremen just seven years later. The
order-loving German appraised the city with satisfaction: "Pest was
conceived in an orderly manner, the city plan was elaborated with
proper circumspection. The main thoroughfares leading in every
direction from the centre of the town are broad and straight." The
haphazardness of Buda, however, was less to his liking.  "There is no
sign of planning. The streets are neither centralized nor straight;
consequently, the town has no core, and in its network of streets, one
will find nothing that resembles order. The reason for this is the
unfavourable soil and the fact that the roads are cut off by hills,
preventing the population from building their houses in a rational
manner."

 Whether we think of the past or the present, the description is
faithful. Whether to its advantage or otherwise, Pest is comparable to
other big cities lying on the plain. But Buda is unique, like
Stockholm, Istanbul, or Rio, and this is due precisely to its
"disorderliness". Pest may expand without constraint, but Buda is
bound by the surrounding hill country. In the course of its
development, Pest has smothered and devoured its environment, as most
big cities do. But even today, Buda is inseparable from it, despite
the fact that the "peaceful coexistence" between man and nature is
being increasingly threatened. More and more houses are appearing on
the formerly sparsely populated hillsides, and the tentacles of
urbanization feel their way not only upward: they bore their way into
the remotest hollows of the valleys.  Small plots of land are being
congested by large houses, and even sometimes entire neighbourhoods;
the gardens are shrinking, the woods receding into the distance. New
roads are being built, public utilities, service accommodations es-
tablished.

 Nevertheless, Buda continued to be characterized not so much by its
wreath of hills as by the fragmentedness of its inner area. It has no
rational geometrical scheme. The inner city hills -- Rozsadomb,
Naphegy, Varhegy (Castle Hill), Gellert-hegy and Sashegy, -- which
boast perhaps the world's only big city nature conservation area,
divide the body of the town into sections, thus giving the whole a
diversified, exciting aspect. The old sixteenth-century Italian say-
ing according to which the world has three gems: Venice on the water,
Florence on the plain, and Buda on the hill, in all probability still
holds true, and so does the ironic saying of Hungarian architects,
according to which the natural endowments of Buda are so beautiful
that even they, the architects. can't wipe them out completely.

Subject: More FCC Airwave Auctioning
Organization: College of Computer Science, Northeastern University


NEW AUCTION RULES FOR WIRELESS CABLE

The FCC issued new rules for auctioning 493 licenses for "wireless
cable," a subscription-based service that transmits television
programming over the airwaves to TVs equipped with special receivers.
Wireless cable, also known as multichannel, multipoint distribution
services or MMDS, already serves more than 2.3 million people
worldwide, and industry groups have warned that the auction could
hinder rather than encourage competition.  "The FCC is attempting to
graft a very successful process onto an area where it doesn't belong,"
says the legal counsel for the Wireless Cable Association
International.  Industry officials have worried about "scalpers" who
would go after the licenses, only to turn around and sell them for
inflated profits, but the new rules mandate that the licensees must
build their own systems within five years.  (Investor's Business Daily

Reply-To: Paul Robinson <Paul@TDR.COM>
Organization: Tansin A. Darcos & Company, Silver Spring, MD USA 


Greetings. 

I want to find a PC card, either as a modem, or a standalone card,
that can be put into an 8086 or 80286, that will allow the device to
do the following: 

   1. Answer the phone when it rings.   

   2. Accept incoming Touch-Tone(R) signals (DTMF) and decode them  
      so the program can see them. It would be nice if it
      recognized A-B-C and D buttons (not found on most consumer
      telephones), but it isn't necessary. 

   3. Generate outgoing Touch-Tone, again A-B-C-D is nice as an
      extra feature. 

   4. Be able to play a recorded voice file, or play other files
      on various selections.

I would like it to have (but I can do without) the following: 

   5. Be able to record incoming voice. 

I know voice takes about 8-40K of disk space per second depending on
how it is encoded or compressed.
 
Cost is a (but not THE only) factor here.  If it is a single line
card I am assuming I can use an 8086 or 80286 to run it. 
 
Used is okay. 
 
If it is a multiline card (or multiline is significantly less per
port) then I'd be interested as well.  Also, if this comes in an
external modem or other device instead of internal, that would also be
nice.  Whatever I can find.  I'd need to know what the minimum
processor and speed machine (8086-10, 80286-12, 386sx-16, 386DX-33,
486 ...) that it will run acceptably at, say, if all four ports were
simultaneously in use performing the most processor or disk intensive
task that the system has to perform.
 
I'd either like to be able to program it from a language (Basic,
Pascal, whatever ...) or that the system it comes with has a rich
enough scripting capability to branch on incoming Touch-Tone digits,
time of day, time the caller has been on, etc.

What I want is something that will do items 1 thru 4 or 5 above, so
that I can use it as a type of announcement system, and/or use it
for people to request appointments. 

I'd like to know if it either has a data modem, or a fax/data modem,
so I could use it for a "Faxback" system as well, although if it's
cheaper without it, I can use that. 

If the card supports both a POTS (Standard incoming) telephone line
and PBX-style DID lines, that would be a nice option for the future,
while it is not that important, but I would consider it. Also, are
there any with an API that allows someone to use an application to
access it?

Or, in the alternative, does the program supplied have a rich enough
script language to allow someone to customize what it does?  I know
there was one that once allowed people to program it using Basic.

Is that feasable?  Has anyone already tried something like that?  How

Organization: UCLA Extension


On September 26-29, 1995, UCLA Extension will present the short
course, "Optical Fiber Communications: Techniques and Applications",
on the UCLA campus in Los Angeles.

The instructors are Tran V. Muoi, PhD, President, Optical Communication
Products, Del Hanson, PhD, Principal Engineer, Hewlett-Packard, and
Richard E. Wagner, PhD, District Manager, Bellcore.

This course offers a review of optical fiber communications
fundamentals, then focuses on state-of-the-art technology and its
applications in present and future communication networks.

The course begins with the major building blocks of optical fiber
communications systems ( fiber and passive components, sources and
transmitters, detectors and receivers).  Actual design examples of
fiber optic links for short-haul and long-haul applications are
studied, and recent technological advances in addressing problems due
to fiber loss and dispersion are presented.

The impact of fiber optic technology on communications is highlighted
in the latter half of the course.  Recent developments in local and
metropolitan area networks to support multimedia traffic (i.e., data,
voice, and video) and their evolving architectures and standards are
fully covered.  The treatment on telecommunications systems includes
various technological options for subscriber networks, exchange
networks, and the global undersea networks.  Network architectures
evolving from the traditional telephone and CATV networks are
contrasted.  Technology trends and directions for realizing the
so-called information superhighway are examined as well.  Finally,
optical networks using wavelength routing and multi-wavelength
cross-connects are presented.

The course fee is $1295, which includes extensive course materials.

Slovenia currently has a population of 2M and 15 different area codes.
ARNES (Academic and Research NEtwork of Slovenia) has dial-up access
to Internet in almost all areas, but users have to call different
numbers in different areas.
 
So, they asked Slovenian Telekom to provide an equal number in every
area. Now the user has to dial 9744 and he gets connected to nearest
dial-up.  ARNES was also told that the calls would not be charged more
than before.
 
But: Telekom is charging each call to 9744 five to ten times more than
it charges the calls to "normal" (different for each area) numbers.
 
Has anything like that happened somewhere else? How did the users
respond?
 
If anyone wishes to respond by email: dalibor.cerar@uni-lj.si

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Here in the USA we have many instances of
(for example) 800 numbers which terminate in various places depending on
where the call originates. We also have some numbers in, I believe, the
950 series which do this. They are not inexpensive by any means, and the
routing by place or time of day does add some cost over and above the
regular rate for a call. Whether it is five to ten times more expensive
or not I do not know. I doubt it is that much. I would suggest whoever is
administering the 9744 thing for your network should meet with someone at
the telecom administration and find out exactly how the calls are being
rated and billed. It may wind up being less expensive to arrange to 
forward calls yourself.   PAT]

Mike Long 
FBI Branch: Texas code- 345-444.55.32.1


[TELECOM Digest Pervert Editor's Note: What a crude forgery this is!
'Simular subject matter' ... I wonder if he means 'similar subject
matter'?  'gov.net.fbi.com'??  The <F>ederal <B>ureau of <I>nquisition  
is a branch of the government in Texas? And that number following the
phrase 'Texas code' is just a lot of gibberish. I am surprised he did
not choose a more creative alias for himself, such as Mike Hunt. As the
late, great comedian Jack Benny would have said, "Really, Mary ..."

But watch and see: over the next few days the message from Special Agent
in Charge of Investigating Perversion and Perversity on Usenet Mike Long 
will circulate around Usenet, finding its way into many various news-
groups. The Usenetters will start squalling and screeching about their
freedom of speech; they'll demand that someone do something; the EFF
and ACLU will resume sending out their *massive*, *humongous* missives
telling everyone to get busy writing to the senators, the president,
the head of the FBI, the governor of Texas, etc, sample letters
enclosed you can cut and paste if you like. Some Usenetters will
actually believe the message is real.

So remember, Big Brother is watching YOU ... and he wants you to behave
yourself fellow perverts, or 'preverts' as President Johnson once noted.
He has a great contest going on: whoever writes the most creative and 
realistic messages in alt.sex.whatever get an all-expenses-paid trip to
the nice summer camp that Big Brother is sponsoring for underprivileged 
perverts and other Victims of Society deep in the California desert
near the Nevada border. You never heard of it? Well, that's because
Big Brother keeps it top secret. He does not want those of you who are
not winners in the Most Tasteless and Crude message on Usenet contest 
to be disappointed.  Everyone is guarenteed to be a winner some day.  

And if Big Brother wants a catalog of all USA posters the net, he does
not need to make one ... it already exists, called the Internet White
Pages.     PAT]

 From: Jean-Yves Hemlin" <JHEMLIN@POST.SYGMA.NET>


For release Tuesday, May 23, 1995 -- Versit(TM), a global initiative
formed in November by Apple, AT&T, IBM and Siemens, today announced
the open availability of its first specifications intended to promote
interoperability among existing and emerging communications and
information products. Now available are:

1) The Versit Personal Data Interchange Specification, a common format
for exchanging information such as electronic business cards via wired
or wireless connections; and

2) The Versit GeoPort(TM) Universal Network Port, a high-speed wired
connection and communications architecture for computers, mobile
devices and telephones.

These specifications are the first of several to be issued by Versit
in the areas of personal data interchange, computer-telephony
integration, and collaboration. They are openly available without
license or royalty fees to help equipment manufacturers and software
developers build computers, telephones and other communications and
information devices, services and applications that make it easy for
users to collaborate and exchange voice, data, images and video across
a diversity of platforms.  Through these specifications, software
developers and equipment manufacturers can gain access to larger
markets at reduced development cost.

Personal Data Interchange (PDI)

The Versit PDI specification provides a cross-platform solution for
the exchange of personal information and defines an electronic
business card called a Versitcard(TM).  With Versitcards, users will
be able to electronically exchange such information as name, address,
phone number and electronic mail IDs, or even "URLs", the Universal
Resource Locators that help people find specific areas on the Internet
World Wide Web easily.  Using products and applications that
incorporate Versitcard, users could, for example, exchange electronic
business cards at a meeting and store these Versitcards in their
computer or PDA's address book without having to rekey the data.  In
an integrated computer-telephony environment, users might exchange
their Versitcards on the electronic "table" at the start of a desktop
video and data conference.

Versitcards will be carried in universal electronic "containers"
called Bentograms, based on Bento(TM), an object-oriented technology
that is the OpenDoc Standard Interchange Format for storage and
exchange of data.  Devices with more limited processing power such as
as organizers, pagers and home answering machines could receive such
information via containers called Simplegrams; developers could use
them and Bentograms to create other types of applications as well,
such as cards holding calendar information that could be exchanged
electronically.

Device Connectivity and Computer-Telephony Integration

Also available today is the hardware specification for the Versit
GeoPort computer-telephone connection, which provides up to 200 times
the bandwidth of traditional serial ports. As a foundation technology
for the integration of personal computers with telephone systems, it
allows users access to the full digital capabilities of their PBX
systems through their personal computer and provides a superior,
dedicated, cross-platform solution for combining voice and real-time
multimedia. The Versit GeoPort architecture, based on Apple's GeoPort
technology, will allow users to dial phone calls, receive voice mail,
access the Internet, transfer files or conduct voice/video/data
conferences, using their desktop or mobile computers.

GeoPort currently ships on Apple's Power Macintosh systems. All four
Versit founders; AOX Inc.; Crystal Semiconductor Corp.; Cypress
Research Corp.; Motorola Inc.; SAT Groupe SAGEM and Zilog Inc., have
announced support for GeoPort. The hardware volume of the
specification is available now, and the software volume will be
available this summer.

Specifications Available Via World Wide Web Site

Both specifications are available now through Versit's new World Wide
Web home page on the Internet at http://www.versit.com. This home page
will have links to the home pages of the Versit founders, will feature
educational columns and answers to frequently asked questions about
Versit, and will offer the industry a forum for discussion of
interoperability issues. The specifications and information about
Versit also can be obtained by calling 1-800-803-6240 (fax: 6241).
From outside the U.S., call 201-327-2803 (fax: 4981).  To ask
questions or receive more information about Versit electronically,
send electronic mail to info@versit.com.  Through development and
promotion of such open, cross-platform specifications, the Versit
founders intend to accelerate availability of interoperable products
and services from competing vendors.  Versit's mission is to publish
specifications to address computing and communications
interoperability issues, and to make them widely available to the
industry.

I am interested in getting Caller ID in my area, but when I called the
phone company they told me that our switch is a DMS 10 and will not
support special features such as caller ID.  Is it true that DMS 10 is
such an antiquated beast?  How long has the DMS 10 been around anyway?

Subject: (PRIish) Bandwidth Management of T1 Channels?
Date: 20 Jun 1995 03:51:24 GMT
Organization: Galloway Research


If user sites use PRI in addition to the hub doing so (e.g. an ISP
net0 then the number of PRI lins at the hub could be less then 1 per
user by only allocating as many B channels as each site currently
needs.  This seems attractive as long as the latency of one 64K
channel is ok and its thorughput you want by going up to 1.472Mbps (23
channels).

However even in a common wire center setup (centrex) the cost of the
PRI on top of T1 (220+dialing charge) just at the user end is more
then the cost of putting a 2nd T1 at the hub for you ($162).  So is
T1<->T1 for 324 the cheapest high speed telco connection to a hub that
shares the same wire center?  At $60/BRI pair you get 5 for the same
price which comes out to 640K (and 4 BRI's is much more likey to be a
supported configuration).

Is there any sort of channelization service options that would allow a
user T1 to have connections on some set of channels of a hub T1 such
that channel allocation and mgt could be done in a similar fashio to
PRI?  Instead of 2 T1s per user, could this get it down to say 2.1?

If that works, can the same be done with T1<->T3?  Having the shared
T1s at the hub be channels of a T3?

Hello,

1. I've got a BOCA 2400 VOICE/FAX/DAT modem with FAXWORKS. It uses the
CIRRUS LOGIC chipset.I want to be able to import a WAV file into the
system for use as a greeting. Can anybody help? I know SUPERVOICE
supports this feature, but it lacks other things FAXWORKS offers (such
as forwarding messages from one mailbox to another). I actually need a
translation utility from FAXWORKS VMF format to WAV and the reverse.

2. Is FAXWORKS a reliable package? From my experience those VOICE
modems based on CIRRUS LOGIC chipset (and maybe ROCKWELL too) crash
the PC quite often.  Your experience will be appreceated.

Please email me directly. 

Regards and shalom,

subject?.  My specific questions are:

     1. What kind of services? 
     2. Technical feasibility? 
     3. Any commercial coupling devices to power lines?
     4. Who are the players? (manufacturers, service providers etc?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I don't know much about it. I do know that
for quite a long time, a number of years ago, the Chicago Transit Authority
operated their telephone network between stations using the electrified
'third rail'. Now they seem to be using mostly UHF radios in the 471 mega-
hertz frequency range for communications between the bus drivers and their
supervisors and between the subway train motormen, conductors and their
supervisors. I can pick them up easily on my scanner since they have about
ten channels. But I think the telephones used by the agents in the collection
booths on the subway and elevated lines may still be connected over the third
rail. It used to be when you called their switchboard (312-MOhawk-4-7200) 
that the connections sounded normal when speaking to an extension in
their office but when you asked to be connected to one of the booths
on a subway line or one of the trackside telephones, the connections
sounded *awful*.  In fact they would not connect outside calls via the
switchboard to those lines unless they thought you were an employee or
authorized to call those extensions. They were for employee use only and
maybe they sounded okay when calling extension to extension, but from the
outside via the switchboard the transmission was not very good.  PAT]

It took me about five tries to read another Gibson work, Neuromancer.
But on the last try, I finished the book.  The best comparison I read
was that most books are like "Gone with the Wind", where cyberpunk
books are more like MTV.  Much higher density to detail, totally
different style.

Don't be talking for everyone here.  I love Dilbert, but I also like
Gibson and Sterling.  Not all nerd-types like only hardcore SF books.

I did like that part.  The movie reminded me a bit of Demolition
Man -- cute, action intense plot, weird characters, not much reality.
(Though the Taco Bell part in D.M. really went overboard. :) )

Mnemonic really was a so-so movie.  I am a Gibson fan (based in large
part on Neuromancer), so I kind of liked seeing how they interpreted
his short story.  It seems that they did it by taking parts and pieces
of almost all of his stuff and sticking it around a lead character.

They left out one of the coolest characters, Molly, and replaced her
with Jane who was not so cool.

Realistically, they probably would have had a much better movie if
they had gone with no-name actors though.

I liked it. I found it entertaining and thought that it reflected the

the more enjoyable 'chase/explosion' movies that I've seen lately. I

I think the idea was that there are environmental influences that affect 
us more and more as technology impinges on our lives. In essence this
would appear to be an expansion of 'envirnmental allergies'.  People
that can't take the formalin in insulation, get sick off paint fumes
etc ... and have to live in sterile natural surrounds ...

A couple of major flaws in the book/movie are :

- Memory is not stored serially in the brain. Downloading information 
into a localized portion of the mind doesn't hack it ...

- Kinda hard to imagine that if technology is ** so ** detrimental and 
pervasive that they'd be able to crank out a miracle cure that could be 
stored on a disk ...

 ... But I still liked it ... Too bad they didn't have a 'Molly' in the 
flick instead of 'Jane' ...

Back in 1980-81, Sprint only had calling cards, and with your calling
card you got a little booklet which listed the local access numbers and
the prefixes in each of the couple dozen metropolitan areas you could
dial into.  You couldn't call Binghamton, Modesto, Peoria or Pensacola,
but you could dial to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, or Miami.  I also
remember a few road trips in that era, checking on the map to see how
far to the next city I could call from.

Sprint certainly didn't engage in blacklisting of countries at that
point, since it was still purely domestic.  I don't remember anything
about discriminating on giving out the cards, but I didn't start with
Sprint until 1982, when they added Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey, to
their access lists.

In addition to my last post --

I am calling from Germany and had the chance to use several MCI
calling cards. No card would allow me to call certain numbers, like for
example 716-655-1110, 201-345-4315, 313-383-2116, etc.  Also European
numbers are blacklisted, but for most countries I just had to add one
digit to the number, like for example +49 54614654 is blacklisted, but
when I add a 2 or any other digit +49 54614654-2 and dial it right
thru the MCI computer, it will work. That won't work for US numbers as
MCI only accepts ten digit numbers.

These numbers are BBS lines, but I also had voice numbers being blacklisted,
and one rumour came thru to me, that MCI would also not sell calling cards
to people whose Telephone Number is blacklisted.

So I can't call *any* number.

I dont know on how MCI choses if they blacklist a number or not, but
if its fraudulent calling, how could the owner of the line know
someone is calling him by stolen calling cards? They just blacklist his
number and then, when his Grandma from Europe tries to call him with
her MCI card, she wont get thru. This can't be legal what MCI is doing.


Sorry for my bad English,

seen@ripco.com


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Is Grandma a phreak also? I guess MCI 
figures that the likelyhood of Grandma in Europe having an MCI card and
wanting to use it to call her grandson the USA phreak ('such a good
boy, and so smart with computers!' she would say) is little or non-
existent. And if it happens, it happens. Grandmas are supposed to suffer
and sacrifice for their grandchildren, right? Do the proprietors of 
phreak BBS lines know the origin and nature of their incoming traffic?
Do they have many German grandmothers calling them? I'll let you decide. 

In the USA, the telcos are required to provide service to all *qualified*
applicants for same. In this context, 'qualified' means the applicant has
the ability and *willingness* to pay for the services rendered. They are
not required to extend service to persons found to be unwilling to pay.
But -- and this is an important catch -- I believe it is of questionable
legality to blacklist entire countries unless they are saying that all
the people in a given country commit fraud, etc. They can deny service
to a person of any ethnic origin or background based on that person's
specific history, but not to everyone of that ethnic origin. 

Can service be denied to the recipient of a call based on the actions
of the calling party? Well, telco's answer is 'we are not denying
service to the called party, we are denying service to the calling
party'. The fact that in telephone communications, unlike say,
purchasing merchandise in a market with a stolen credit card, it takes
two to tango is irrelevant. The service is deemed to be sold to the
originator of the traffic, not the recipient.  If no one calls you,
your phone does not ring. This does not mean telco is somehow
discriminating against *you*; its just how the system operates.

I think somewhere they have tariffs on file which do allow specific
remedies in cases of chronic fraud traffic. Let me ask you this: are
you able to get through to Ripco here in the USA or are they blocked
also?  <grin> ... While I object strenuously to the telcos blacklisting
of entire neighborhoods in the USA and entire countries elsewhere, I
don't have a lot of sympathy in situations where phreaking and phraud
calling is rampant. Tell Grandma I said hello.      PAT]

Mexico City (and possibly all or most of Mexico) uses a set of '9X'
codes for Toll, Special Billing Toll (Collect, Person, third-party,
Charge Card), US/Canada Toll, International, and other services
(information, etc). I do not know what their standard PBX outside line
code is.  These 9X codes are used on regular POTS lines. These codes
are published (in Spanish, of course) in the front of the directory.
Sorry, but I don't have the actual list of 9X code assignments in
front of me, and I'm not sure of how a North American (AT&T) Card is
used for intra-Mexico calls.

Given the large number of cable companies who have:

* poor quality RF distribution amplifiers
* poor quality, weather-beaten coaxial cable
* poor quality ingress installations
* poor quality production equipment
* poor quality production methods (i.e., bozos who play with all the

Subject: 800 FCC Order, and 888 Implementation


AT&T has asked the FCC to refine the order by instituting a "market
share" allocation plan, in which the DSMI would allocate a maximum of
28 thousand 800 numbers per week among the RespOrgs, in proportion to the
percentage of 800 numbers each RespOrg held in "working" or "reserved"
status during a period of time specified by the FCC.
 
Pending feedback from other RespOrgs, the FCC has agreed to pursue this
idea. 
 
Regarding 888 Implementation, my firm was present at, and participated
in last week's FCC 888 implementation meeting.  The FCC Order was just
one of many significant issues addressed.  Interested parties can call

Reply-To: jbucking@callamerica.com


One impotant point to remember is that the FCC limit on 800 numbers is
the same for all RESP ORGs no matter what size. This means smaller
carriers have no shortage of numbers since many of us never come close
to 200 new numbers a week.

Make sure to check with smaller carriers if you are having trouble
getting a new number. You should be able to find a smaller carrier in
your area by checking the yellow pages under "Long Distance Telephone
Companies"

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Actually Jeff, you should not be so modest
and generous in telling people to look around for carriers. Your own
product there, 'My Line' is one of the best deals available. In fact it
has been awhile since I mentioned it, so I will give a brief summary
today.

If you subscribe to MyLine (this is one of the carriers I use for 800
service) you get:

A personal 800 number with programmable call forwarding built right in.
You program in three locations or numbers you want the system to use to
try and reach you. You change these at will. When someone dials your 800
number they hear a recording in your voice saying whatever you want to
say and asking them to please hold while their call is transferred to
you. The system then rings the first number you gave, and if there is
no answer it moves on to the next number. A third number is for your
'priority calls' and if someone who knows to do this dials your 800 number
and punches in your programmable two digit 'priority code' then they are
routed to the priority number instead of the usual numbers in your list.

You can also make outgoing calls via your 800 number. When you call in,
you enter your password right over your outgoing greeting and the system
changes to administrative mode. You get the prompt 'MyLine is ready', and
you can then make outgoing calls all over the world; you can reprogram
your list of numbers to be searched; you can check voicemail if you have
that additional option on your account; you can request callbacks for
international dialing purposes; wake up and reminder calls, etc.

I often times use MyLine for a wakeup call when I need to get up early in
the morning for some reason. It rings me back at the time specified and
waits for me to punch in my password to acknowledge the callback.

MyLine also has 'virtual call waiting' and three way calling. If you are
on a call (either inbound that you received or outbound that you originated
via your 800 number) then if another call should arrive and MyLine knows
you are on the system, it will give you a call-waiting beep. You punch
digits to hold one call and answer the other. You can also originate
conference calls at no additional charge -- essentially three-way calling --
when using MyLine by putting one outgoing call on hold while getting someone
else on the line, etc.

Overall, MyLine is the best personal 800 number service I have found, and
I have been a satisfied customer for more than a year now. I forget how much
I pay, but its only about ten dollars per month plus the cost of the calls
in and out.  Send email to Jeff (jbucking@callamerica.com) to get a very
detailed file about MyLine and how to subscribe. Typically they have you
turned on in a day or two.    PAT]

If I was an Internet Access Provider, I think I would consider not selling
an account to anyone who was under 18. It sure would a lot easier than
trying to shut down everything on the net that might be construed as indecent.
Just say that the whole net is rated X and if parents let their kids use
their Internet account, it's their fault.

I wonder what the effect of the word 'purposefully' will have on Prodigy and 
moderated newsgroups? Will it be safer to not try to monitor the traffic?

I also wonder what 'commercial purposes' means? Is it okay to let kids
have pornography as long as you don't charge them for it?

Some competitors may already have their own wires.  For instance, if a
cable TV company decides to enter the phone market, they would
probably use their existing cable plant for the infrastructure,
perhaps upgrading the trunks to fiber optics in order to handle the
increased load.

That's seems probable to me as well.  Other possibilities are wireless
phone services competing with local carriers.  These can probably be
priced less expensively than mobile wireless phones, since they don't
have to worry about phones moving from cell to cell.

Whoever owns it will "control it". The phone company their wires, the
cable companies their cables; there are already fights over conduit
space under the streets and in buildings, apartment complexes, etc.
The regulators will have to lay down some ground rules since a pole
does have a practical limit on the number of attachements and cable
loads.

> Will there be an exponential explosion in the number of overhead wires

There already are places where there are two cable companies a phone
company and the power company sharing the pole. Hopefully fiber trunks
will mean smaller lighter cables or the poles are going to get a lot
bigger.

It will be for a charge. Ameritech has already split into business
groups, customer services, network services, etc. So the even the
vestige of the regulated Baby Bell (the one who used to be the only
phone company) will be purchasing services from network services, and
renting repair services from consumer servies, etc. (The one whose
going to make out is the one who sells velcro attached signs for the
trucks, maybe a bus sign that can change as they drive!) 

It isn't inconceivable that some entreprenuer could wire an area and
charge others to use their access. (This might work in rural and less
dense areas, maybe a township income opportunity, might be way for a
city to make some bucks if they owned some wire.  Although in
Columbus, Ohio a company said they were going to fiber an affluent
neighborhood and both Warner and Ameritech said they wouldn't consider
using someone else's wire, it seems a little short sighted. Maybe a
carrier who doesn't have that capital investment can provide service
cheaper and make the biggies rethink their position if the competition
gets too much.

No -- especially if you plan on moving data down either of them.

Telephone lines depend on the runs being balanced.  This cancels out
induced currents due to common mode rejection.  Sharing one wire will
unbalance the line.  There are other problems as well, e.g. the phone
company will likely generate trouble tickets if it detects "crossed
lines", which is what this would amount to.

If you want to invest some heavy bucks in a carrier system, you can
run two lines on a single pair -- but you'll come out an awful lot
cheaper getting someone to install the right cable.  If you have
conduits in place, it should be a reasonably simple job.  However, if
this is for a house, I can virtually guarantee the cable was not run
through conduit.  Typically, it's run through walls and tied around
nails, preventing pulling of new cable.

If Ma Bell doesn't do work to your specs, you could either go with a third
party installer (interconnect), or hire a friend who has Telco experience. 
If you want a particularly neat job, you may require an electrician to rip
out walls and install conduit.  Or you could do it yourself.  Radio Shack
has a book on home telephone installation.

I've seen some units that send the telephone signal through the power
lines using radio frequencies, but my experience with this technology
(I work with data devices that use the power line to communicate -- or
I should say, that TRY TO use it :-) has not been favorable.  Any
device that plugs into the wall that has a capacitive input (such as
line conditioners we all use for our computers) will bleed this signal
off.  If you buy a new electrical device with a capacitive AC input,
it will kill the RF signal.  Also, to be effective, they MUST be on
the same electrical circuit breaker.  I would never consider one for
my home or business.

I had one of these from US West about three years ago.  It was called
an "AML", presumably for Analog Multiplex Line or something similar,
although I've also heard them referred to as SLC-1's (not to be
confused with the venerable SLC-96).

At the time I had a Hayes V-Series 9600 baud modem, and it worked
perfectly over either the main line or the frequency-shifted line on
the AML.  The throughput and reliability seemed to be just like a
regular non-multiplexed line.  I can't speak about 14.4 or 28.8 one
way or the other.

The only thing I didn't like about the AML is that the on-hook voltage
for the second line was considerably less than 48VDC, so the "in use"
lamps on all of my phones always showed the second line as "in use."
Other than that, it worked normally.

There are two mechanisms available for cordless modem operation; D
channel data similar to GSM (not quite what you intended but achieves
the same result), or a standard modem operating in the audio band. You
don't mention a specific cordless phone technology, but there has been
a significant amount of work done in CT2 to test the viability of
audio band modems operating over the air. The limit to the baud rate
is determined by the ADPCM sampling rate rather than the air interface. 
Provided you have a reliable RF link (range, space diversity at base
station, environment will affect this) you can sustain a 9600 baud
link with no problem. CT2 also has the capability of transferring data
in the D channel like GSM, but faster (I think approximatly 28Kbaud).

There are several companies offering CT2 cordless modem products now. Try 
contacting COM1 in Bordeaux France, or Digicom in Belgium. Also I have seen 
a cordless modem attachment for an Apple PowerBook.

DECT also uses ADPCM coding for the B channel so should give similar 
results in a good RF environment.

One point to watch is that V22 modems will suffer severely if the base 
station does not suppress sidetone to an analogue line, but then who uses 
V22 modems nowadays? :).

Subject: Disrupted Calls and NO Call Waiting
Date: 20 Jun 1995 16:34:38 -0400
Organization: The Greater Columbus Freenet


Data Interruption without Call Waiting:
 
        Recently some unusual events have occurred on one of my lines.
I have a 'special' line that rings directly to my desk in my study at
home.  There is no other appearance of this line anywhere else.
Sometimes I use this line for modem access.  Very few people (less
than twelve) have been given this number, and there is NO call waiting
or Caller ID on this line.  The call waiting and caller ID status has
been verified by the TelCo and by my own tests.

        In (now numerous) instances, when I have been using the line
for modem communications, I have had the call 'dropped', ie; "NO
CARRIER" message on the communications software.  This is almost
always followed, within three or four minutes by a voice call from one
of the twelve people who have access.  When asked, they say that they
DID try to call about three to five minutes ago, but got a "busy signal".
This does not happen in every case, but the statistical evidence of
their previous call causing a disruption of my data call is
overwhelming IMHO.

        Here is the tricky part; these problem calls come (for the
most part) from government locations.  Nothing sinister, just routine
military (and some other agency) locations and bases throughout the
US.  There are a few overseas calls (but I don't know how they are
introduced into the US telephone network).  There does not seem to be
a problem when the number is called from other locations, and/or local
numbers (ie; my other line).

        My first thoughts were that the "Operator" is testing the number
for a true "busy" condition, or some kind of similar test (why I couldn't
guess) instituted in/by/for the military switching equipment connected to
the network.  This got shot down (I think) in that some (not all) of the
calls are from pay (coin) phones at the military base(s), and I am told by
the person calling that the "Operator" was not involved. [Although just
how a pay phone long distance call would not involve an "Operator" (or
like circuit) is somewhat beyond me.]

        If anyone can produce a reasonable guess as to what is happening,
I would be interested in knowing. I'm not sure that there is a "fix", but 
curiosity overwhelms me.

Hi - I'm looking for some help here.  I got a postcard the other day 
that had my name handwritten on the front and the following message
printed on the back:

It is our responsibility to let you know about your current account
status.  Please call 1-800-769-3576  ext XXXXX

No need to include the actual extension, I guess.  Anyway, I got an
AT&T operator interested enough to do some looking and tell me that
the service is provided by LDDS Metromedia (in San Antonio).  I called
LDDS and before I could get more than a couple of words out about
why I was calling, the person on the other end said something about
how she couldn't give me the name of the company, that I would need
a subpeona to get the information, and that I would have to file with
my local District Attorney if I wanted to press charges for harassment
or fraud.  I wasn't all that worried before I called, just curious as
to what it was all about.  Now I'm worried.

Any clue as to what this might be all about?

When I called the number and the extension, a recording came on after
I entered the extension and said "Thank you.  This completes your
call."  No information as to what it was about.

Thanks for any advice/assistance.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Okay, what happened was this. Some company
is trying to contact you. Most likely a collection agency or an attorney
for a creditor, although it could be for other reasons. Do you have a
non-published number? In any event, *someone* is trying to get ahold of
you and has been unable to get your phone number. The number you called
is a service designed to help root out unlisted numbers from individuals
who are tricked into calling the 800 number. They have real-time ANI on
the line. When you called, your number was captured in their database.
The 'extension number' you were asked to punch in was nothing more than
a control number they used to match the ANI they received with the person
who made the call. Let's say your postcard said to punch in 'extension 12345'
when you called. They know that 12345 was assigned to your name at your
address, and now they have your phone number to go with it. You'll no doubt
be hearing from them soon; probably a phone call demanding payment for
whatever it is you owe. Clever way of getting non-published numbers, eh?

Now it is true you might have been calling from a work phone or a neigh-
bor's house or something like that; none the less they now have in their
file a phone number where *someone* (if not yourself) is likely to know
who you are and how to reach you. 

I read about this service sometime ago, but I forget the fellow's name
who runs it. He offers to obtain non-published numbers for his clients
at some fee per number obtained. You send him the name and address of
the person whose number you want. He sends out his postcard asking
that person to call to the 'extension number' given. He then provides
his clients with the results; the ANI obtained when you call and
provide him with the requested control number for match-up purposes.
He says his success rate is pretty high in obtaining non-pub residence
phones since most people out of curiosity want to find out who it is
and think nothing of simply dialing the number from their home phone.
After all, they come in from work each night, check the mail they
received, and go to the phone and dial the number, just as he asked
them to do. I think he charges his clients about ten dollars for each
number thus obtained; it costs him about a dollar to print up and mail
the postcard and about thirty cents to accept your phone call on his
800 line. 

By now you may have already received that ugly phone call you thought
you would never receive since the creditor did not have your new home
phone number, eh?  Well surprise, you fell in their booby trap. Take
care about calling back places just because some postcard comes in the
mail saying you have to call, or telling you that you have won a prize
of some sort. Those folks are non-pub number specialists.   PAT]

Subject: Re: Telecommunication on Power Lines


Reddy Urimind asked about telecommunications on power lines, and
Patrick Townson added some explanations about telephone communications
over the third rail of the Chicago Transit Authority's transit system.

In some sparsely-settled rural areas of the U.S., telephone service
was provided using existing electric power cables. I'm not sure how
this was done, or whether it is is still a common practice.  (This is
not the same as having telephone cables and power lines attached to
the same poles.)

Electric companies have developed extensive internal telecommunications 
networks and, in some jurisdictions, have sold telecommunications
capacity surplus to their own needs to telecommunications carriers or
to end users. I understand that the United Kingdom has a number of
electric companies that provide telephone service through separate
subsidiaries, for example. These electric company telecommunications
networks use the right-of-way of the electric companies, but do not
use the electric transmission cables themselves. Most of the networks
are fiber optic, I would assume.

Hydro-Quebec, a government-owned electric utility, once owned half
of Sotel Inc., a telephone company serving the James Bay area of
Quebec where the company was building a large hydro-electric project.
Hydro-Quebec's half-interest was subsequently sold to Telebec,
a subsidiary of Bell Canada Enterprises, which had owned the
other half of Sotel.  Some Canadian municipalities provide both
electrical and telephone service to their residents, and Fortis, an
electrical utility in Newfoundland, owns part of Unitel Communications'
Newfoundland operations.

Judith and Pat,

This is creating both an opportunity and a problem.

Opportunity: The Resp. Orgs. that have been hoarding *the good numbers*:
the previously unissued numbers, the numbers that are easily remembered,
repetitive digits, and or numbers that spell something, must release these
numbers (or at least some of them). This makes it a good time to get an
800 number.

Problem: The time frame for recycling has been drastically reduced. If you
get a recently recycled number you are likely to get a lot of calls to the
prior number holder -- and to have to pay for (and respond to) the wrong
number calls.

The Resp. Orgs. claim you have accepted this liability. We recommend that
clients defer publishing/circulating their "new" 800#'s for AT LEAST two
billing cycles in order to figure out how much pollution there is on the
number.

Does anyone have a solution or a way to avoid payment for calls made to
the prior holder of an 800 number? 


Regards, *BOB*


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: There is no way out of paying. The deal
with 800 numbers is you pay everytime the phone rings. You agreed to
do that when you signed up. You wanted to encourage people to call you,
right?  Is it telco's fault the calls you get from public citizen "A. Moron"
were intended for someone else?  PAT]

Subject: Help Finding Daily Rental of Beepers/Cell Phones
Organization: AT&T
Date: Tue, 20 Jun 1995 22:28:30 GMT


I need help locating a place in the Chicago metropolitan area which
rents, or would be willing to rent, cellular phones and/or beepers on
a short term basis.  I have seen such setups at larger malls and
amusement parks (for example Gurnee Mills), where one can rent a beeper for
the day.  

I need to acquire a small number of either beepers or cellular phones
(3-6) to support AFS Intercultural Exchange programs (a non-profit group)
during the fall arrival of international high school students for the
1995-96 school year.  We need these for one week period each summer,
and it is hard to find someone to rent them for that time period.
This is to better co-ordinate a large number of volunteers running
all over O'Hare airport meeting ~1,000 arriving students in 4 terminals!

While some of the volunteers (myself included) do have our own
cell phones, many of those involved have no on going need for such items.
The period in question is August 7-12 this year.

Any help would be appreciated.  Even if any service provider wants to
donate these items for the period in question that does not normally
rent beepers/cell phones on a short term basis (day or week), we will
accept!

Date: Tue, 20 Jun 95 14:54:00 +6C


Pat:

I enjoyed reading your explanation of the operation of Operator manual 
exchanges re Lee Winson (TUrner7@pacsibm.org)

Two situations you omitted:

[In cities/metro-areas during the 'good-ole-days' (late 1920's thru early 
1960's), you had MIXED manual and dial operation among the various 
exchanges.]

Dial to Manual calls and Manual to Dial calls!

Calls coming into a manual exchange from a dial exchange in the same local 
calling area did not require voice communication between the calling (dial) 
party and the operator in the manual office. There was a 'Panel Call 
Indicator' associated with each operator's position. When the Operator 
plugged into an incoming jack from a dial exchange, the dialed last 4 (or 
5) digits plus (possible) party line 'ring' letter displayed on the lighted 
panel:

 ___ _______ _______ _______ _______ ___
|   |       |       |       |       |   |
| 3 | 1 2 3 | 1 2 3 | 1 2 3 | 1 2 3 | W |
| 5 | 4 5 6 | 4 5 6 | 4 5 6 | 4 5 6 | J |
| 6 | 7 8 9 | 7 8 9 | 7 8 9 | 7 8 9 | M |
| 7 |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   | R |
|___|_______|_______|_______|_______|___|

This is an example in a possible office - let's say NApoleon -

NApoleon has mixed dial and manual -

NA1, NA2, NA4, NA8, and NA9 are dial while NA3,5,6,and 7 are manual.

The first column of 3, 5, 6, and 7 show WHICH (manual) NApoleon number was 
dialed - each grid of 1 to 9 & 0 show the digit dialed in each position, and 
the letter (if on a partyline) dialed to ring the SPECIFIC party on a 
partyline.

When the number popped up on this lighted panel, the operator took up a 
called party plug, tested for busy, and if not, plugged into the jack. If it 
WAS busy - DID SHE PLUG INTO A BUSY SIGNAL JACK? or did she enter the line 
and announce 'busy'? (same question for 'out-of-service' due to called party 
being disconnected for nonpayment, etc).

NOW for calls going TO a dial office, obviously each position had a rotary 
dial. Operator would take up a plug to an outgoing jack-

WAS THERE A SEPERATE BANK OF JACKS FOR EACH DIAL OFFICE (with maybe a 
'tandem' office to 'gather' a handful of maybe suburban exchanges)?

OR WAS IT AN OUTGOING TRUNK JACK to a set of STEP selector switches located 
in the same building -  for outgoing trunks (or maybe a Crossbar 
link-frame)??

DID SHE HEAR DIALTONE?? - or maybe checked a set of lamps??

This position is based on existing policies in Germany and the UK, where 
the GSM operators were not allowed to participate in the tenders for 
DCS1800 licences. The rationale behind it is the stimulation of effective 
competition.

Sweden is probably the European country where this argument is the least 
valid (although I personally think it is indeed valid) because it has the 
most open market for telecommunications infrastructure and services, 
including for mobile systems.

I'm not sure that I understand exactly what you mean. If your question 
relates to so-called national roaming, I am aware of the fact that this has 
been explicitly foreseen by the telecommunications regulatory authority in 
the Netherlands in the GSM licence for the 'second operator' and that it 
has been more or less imposed (under pressure from the European 
Commission's General Directorate for competition) in Italy. There may be 
voluntary/commercial national roaming agreements between GSM or DCS1800 
operators in other countries. Maybe someone else can comment on this.

SSC> If there were five Swedish DCS licenses and licenses one through 
SSC> three went to Telia, Comviq and Europolitan (Swedish GSM operators)

Not. I would either choose not to enter the market for mobile services for 
the time being (until a next generation technology comes along) or I would 
consider acquiring one of the already licensed operators.

YB on France:

This looks very likely indeed. I had come to precisely the same conclusion.

Sam, I checked out your home page again (the first time was in the real 
early days of personal home pages). How did you get this unique telephone 
number? From which operator(s)? Keep it for as long as you can - even if 
they make you pay extra. One day you might be able to auction it off for 
big money. ;-)

matching department at corporate headquarters.

To be fair, in the meetings I've been in, nearly everybody there were
techies. (This is MasterCard International. Other than trademark and brand
maintenance, our main products are computer and networking services.
=Most= of us are techies.)  So some of the social issues involved in
having to operate our own conference equipment might not have come up.

The eye contact thing bothered me, too, but it didn't seem to get in the
way of work getting done, and nobody else complained about it. You end up
replacing those non-verbal cues with hand waving or verbal cues to
indicate when you're done, when you'd like to speak, or who you're
directing a remark or question at; it's a little more awkward, but
workable.  In a way, it felt a little like being on IRC or some other chat
service, except that I could usually tell who was paying attention.

Since we were all techies, and both rooms have local and remote control,
it seems like whenever somebody got bored, they'd start fiddling with the
camera aim or focus; sometimes it was helpful, other times it was
distracting. (I was one of the most guilty, I confess. Gadget freaks ...
go fig.)

But it seemed to me that everybody who'd done it more than once got pretty
quickly down to business, and got over the novelty and problems of
videoconferencing. It was a hot-button politically sensitive issue we were
dealing with, so it took us a =lot= of meetings to achieve not very much,
but I don't blame any of that on videoconferencing.

After all, what were the alternatives? We needed to gather together people
from St. Louis and New York to work on a mid-priority project. Actual
face-to-face meetings would have gotten expensive in a real hurry,
thousands of dollars a week just in airfare and/or hotel expenses.
Besides, both groups had high priority projects at home that they couldn't
leave.

Voice-only conferencing, even with the best voice conferencing bridges,
was something we tried when we couldn't get an appointment in the
videoconferencing room, and it was =much= harder to keep everybody's
attention and keep them all focused on the same thing at the same time.
Had we had to settle it all in writing, either via email or (Gods forbid)
memos, we wouldn't have ever gotten =anything= done.

So yeah, videoconferencing has its annoyances. It's clearly not a finished
technology, at least not the way we have it installed. But boy, it's a
nice inexpensive alternative to a =lot= of travel dollars, and it has
helped a lot of cross-continent and even inter-continental teams to get
work done.

%P   410
%T   "Internet Firewalls and Network Security", 
 
The introduction states that this book is for those who already
realize the risks of attaching a system to the Internet.  This extreme
limitation of audience may explain the poverty of the tutorial
materials, lack of overall organization, and uneven content.  Those
who are building firewalls know that information is hard to get, and
they are willing to go for just about anything.
 
There is a fair amount of material in the book.  It tends to jump from
definitions which are simplistic almost to the point of inaccuracy on
one page, to technical minutiae on the next, so this is a work to be
battled with in order to extract the goods.  The difficulty is not
reduced by the fact that the authors insist on defining, not too
explicitly, new jargon.  It is therefore difficult to assess whether
advice about firewall architecture is truly as pedestrian as it
sounds, or merely confused wording.
 
A possibly useful feature is the inclusion of material on specific
packet screening and firewall systems.  This is quite limited, and
does not address the new "complete kit" firewall systems currently
coming to market.  It does mention some PC-based screening routers
which may be helpful for testing and experimentation.
 
Some text, such as the section on mailing lists and other electronic
contracts, appears based on material that is three or more years old.
(More up-to-date material is provided in Appendix B.)
 
I recall a story about a network-connected system which had been
"secured" by removing its "outbound" capability.  The transmit pins,
on the device connected to the Internet, had been physically sheared
off.  To demonstrate this, the team "sent" a ping to a remote
site -- and got an immediate response.  As it turned out, the machine
was also connected to an internal network, and the routing tables had
found a gateway which eventually fed out to the Internet.  Network
security is complex.  You will need to work at it.

Subject: UPT Around the World
Date: 22 Jun 1995 14:19:40 GMT


Readers of the Digest,

I'm trying to do do a market survey on Universal Personal Telephony
and the implementations that are availiable today.  But it's pretty
hard to get a grip on what's out there.  I've been a Telia Persona
(Telia, Sweden) customer now for almost six months.  But I want an
international perspective on things to be able to guess what is to
come.

Persona, which is an "ambitous" service based on technology from
AccesLine, gives you the ability to divert calls both manually and by
a schedule.  The schedule can then be turned on and off.  Voicemail
and pager gateway (not just plain forwardning) to numerical pager
systems are included.  Voicemail alerts the pager on every new
message.

Post- & Telstyrelsen (PTS), the Swedish regulatory body, has decided
to use prefix 0701 for these kind of services.  Today there is only
Persona but PTS has series 0701-{0,6-9} in spare for later use.  0701
is regarded as a national call so that my redirection of calls to
other numbers is free - as long as the forwarded number is not an
international, premium or cellphone call.

I'll try to summarise by writing what I know so far (or think I know)
and hopefully you can supply me with comments, suggestions and
pointers.


UPT

The concept of one person one number.  Ability to screen calls as to
filter out people who at that particular instant are not welcome.
E.g. I might want to redirect all calls but those from my spouse to my
mailbox if very busy.


Europe

It looks as if 07 might be some sort of (European) standard in this
area.  I remember reading somewhere that the UK, as of PhONEday, now
are to move all personal numbers to 07.  It appears to me that Finland
are to do the same thing when they change their numbering scheme
completely autumn '96 (Kimmo correct me if I'm wrong).  In Sweden 070,
except for 0701, is GSM.  In some future Personal numbers in Sweden
are to move to 0700 (+7 digits).  No date is set but there will be a
move.  Number portability hasn't been discussed yet but will probably
be on the agenda as soon as there is competition on UPT or when
Singapore Telecom starts offering telphony services to their 240,000
cable TV customers in Stockholm.  What's the status on number
portability in other countries?


USA/Canada

500 numbers are availiable since January.  From what I've read Bell
Atlantic (amongst others. which else?) are pushing very hard.  My
guess is that since the SIM-card concept (as in GSM) isn't availiable
terminal independent numbers become more interesting.  One thing I am
very curious about is if any of the proposed american PCN/PCS services
are planned to incorporate GSM-styled SIM-cards.  OK, it would be very
nice to be able to use a dual-mode phone in North America, but being
able to rent an "empty" phone and put a SIM card into it isn't to bad
either.  Some US operators can issue GSM SIMs to their subscribers so
that when they travel to Europe, Asia or Africa they can roam as
freely as any GSM user - but unfortunately the reverse isn't really
possible (automatically/securely).

So which are the trends in UPT?  Since one of the bases of the system
is that it is not the calling party that has to do the search, he only
dials *the* number, this burden is put on either the system or on the
number owner.  To what degree can automatisation be included?  To what
extent can voice recognition and AI be included into the system?

I think that much of the future of communication people lies in UPT
and I would very much appreciate your views on this matter.

Sam

From: cwhaley@astral.magic.ca (Charles P. Whaley)
Subject: "Innovation in Telecommunications" Research


I'd like to thank everyone who replied to my earlier request for
information on Centrex user groups and user-oriented online
discussions.  The contact information and copies of PBX vs. Centrex
debates that I received were extremely valuable in getting my research
project underway.

The research involves an analysis of the innovation process in
telecommunications. We all know that many technological innovations
originate in the R&D labs of the telecom manufacturers -- hopefully,
but not always, in response to user needs. What my associates and I
would like to explore are innovations at the user end; where a telecom
customer has modified, adapted or extended his or her telecom
equipment or services to create new services, features or applications
(either for resale, or to solve an internal problem).

If you know of some interesting cases of user innovation of this kind
(either in your own organization or elsewhere), I'd like to hear about
them. I'm not expecting whole essays back, but if you could send a
brief note describing the situation(s) with a name and phone number
(or email address) of someone involved, it would be much appreciated.
We'll follow up with telephone interviews.

I was originally going to limit the project to Centrex users, but
since we're looking for underlying principles rather that product
specifics, the actual telecom system involved probably isn't a major
consideration. So, if you know of someone who has done something
particularly clever or creative by building onto or modifying a key
system, PBX or Centrex system, please let me know. We'll be
interviewing a number of such people, and would be happy to provide a
summary of the results at the end of the project.

P.S. Geography is not an issue. While I'm based in Toronto, I'll be
conducting much of the research with my associates at MIT in
Cambridge, MA.  So examples of American, Canadian or international
user innovations in telecom are all welcome.


Thanks.

US West has asked the commission to reconsider the decision; if they
don't, US West is threatening to file a lawsuit in Federal court,
claiming that this is an unfair situation. Their bone of contention is
that they have as much as $30 million in recent equipment installations 
that have not been "paid for" yet.

The commission will handle a certification process for potential local 
service providers, with the earliest expected certification being in late 
4th quarter of 1995.

The decision also includes the establishment of a universal service fund, 
assumably along the same lines as the national fund, for the same purposes. 
Obviously we all know that the new service providers are going to target 
the heavy telecom users in central Phoenix before they ever even consider 
Tucson, let alone the other 90% of Arizona (geographically speaking), so 
the fund is supposed to cover US West's increased costs to continue 
providing service to those areas.

US West has asked the commission to hold a series of formal hearings on 
this topic before implementing the changes; in my opinion (and others) this 
is just a stall tactic. This has been in discussion with the public and 
members of the commission for over a year, and I'm sure US West has been 
involved. Besides, this isn't the first place that US West has had to deal 
with this, right?

On a related note, yesterday's edition carried a small, back-page type 
notice saying that the permissive dialing period for the 602->520 area code 
change has been extended to October 23, 1995 from July 21. This will make 
the lack-of-number situation in central Phoenix approach the boiling point 
long before then, I'm sure. The new cellular systems in Payson and Winslow 
(just installed by US West) couldn't even be given new 602-NXX exchanges, 
so they were given _existing_ numbers out of the Phoenix area, so local 
phone users in Payson have to dial US West intra-LATA long distance to call 
a cellular customer standing next door to them. Not good, to say the least.

TABLE 13. TELEPHONE NUMBERS ASSIGNED FOR 800 SERVICE (AS OF MARCH 31, 1995 

     On May 1, 1993, procedures for routing 800 calls were changed.  The
first three digits of 800 calls no longer indicate the carrier handling the
call.  The new system enables customers to change service providers while
still retaining the same 800 number.  This system of "portability" relies
on a large data base maintained by Database Service Management, Inc. (DSMI).
During the two years since portability was implemented, the number of
working 800 telephone numbers is reported to have doubled.  The growth of
800 telephone numbers is shown in Table 13.

    (DSMI supplies a monthly summary of the number of 800 numbers assigned,
and that summary is available in the Industry Analysis Division public
reference room.)

800 SERVICE MARKET DATA
(REPORTED BY THE 800 NUMBER ADMINISTRATION SERVICE CENTER)

JB> Second half of table clipped - it mainly repeats data above.  It does
    track the number of 800 service providers, a total of 121 in January
    1995 with the followig disclaimer:

"Service providers" are users of the 800 Service Management System.  Most
are carriers providing 800 service, although the group also includes a
number of local telephone companies and a number of large corporations that
undertake 800 service for such purposes as credit card verification.

JB> Note that there are about 8,000,000 numbers assignable in the 800 NPA.
    As of March 1995 69.1% are 'working' and 9.9% are 'miscellaneous',
    compared to 30.6% and 8% in April 1993.
    Note also that the 'miscellaneous' number is 14.4 of the 'working'.
    The new limit of 3% of the number of 'working' in reserve should lower
    this number.

Subject: More on the FCC 800 Order - June 21 Update from FCC


The June 13th order from the FCC limiting each RespOrg to two hundred 800 
numbers per week was premised on maintaining a depletion of no more
than 28,000 numbers weekly among all the RespOrgs.
 
In a letter dated June 21 from Kathleen Wallman of the FCC to DSMI
president Michael Wade, Ms. Wallman says, "... at least some segments of
the industry recommend that we reexamine the way that total is allocated
among RespOrgs.  They suggest that it would be more equitable and less
disruptive for the Bureau to replace its "per capita" conservation plan
with a "market share" allocation plan." 
 
"Some segments of the industry" refers to AT&T, who first made this request
for "market share" allocation to the FCC on June 14th (as reiterated in an
FCC letter dated June 15th.) 
 
Ms. Wallman goes on, "Assuming that the affected parties find a market
share based plan more reasonable, and that no unforeseen downside is
discovered, we are committed at this point to pursuing this idea.... While
we are analyzing the data needed to introduce a market share allocation
plan and even before the additional system software work is completed, we
believe that the following approach would permit the introduction of such a
plan: 
 
1.  At the beginning of each business week, DSMI would assign each RespOrg
a block of numbers equal to its allocated share of 28,000 numbers. 
 
2.  Until we can perform more refined analysis of the data, each RespOrg
will receive a minimum of 25 numbers a week.  Since there are 138 RespOrgs
(LDDS, Wiltel and EDS are counted as one RespOrg entity, as are RCI New
England and Frontier Communication International), 3,450 numbers will be
taken from the total of 28,000 to meet this allotment, leaving 24,550 to be
assigned as follows: 
 
 -----  In addition to its base of 25 numbers, each RespOrg will receive a
share of the remaining 24,550 numbers that equals the product of 24,550 and
the percentage of all 800 numbers in working, assigned, and reserved status
on August 1, 1995, held by that RespOrg on August 1, 1994. 
 
3.  The RespOrg would place these numbers in one of three categories:  (a)
reserved; (b) working: or (c) hold status.  The last category would be used
to describe those numbers unassigned to any customer of the RespOrg; and 
 
4.  At the end of each business week, each RespOrg must return to DSMI any
numbers in "hold" status." 
 
The letter goes on to outline audit compliance requirements, including
certification of those submitted by the top nine RespOrgs. 
 
So, as of today's date, the DSMI is now directed to assign 800 numbers in
accordance to the procedures outlined above until furtner notice from the
Commission.  The maximum time a RespOrg may have an 800 number in reserve
status has been increased from 15 days to 45 days, and the FCC removed the
incentive that any RespOrg may retain 25% of the 800 numbers returned to
the "transition" status (although the 25% incentive should apply for the
week of June 13, 1995 through June 20, 1995.) 
 
Compliance with this order is to begin 12:01 am eastern time, June 22,
1995.  RespOrgs will be entitled to retain the 200 numbers they took
between June 13, and June 20, 1995 under the per capita conservation plan,
but must return to DSMI any numbers in "hold" status under the procedures
outlined today. 
 
And the beat goes on.....

Reply-To: jbucking@callamerica.com


My company was notified by the SMS 800 bureau yesterday and told that
the original allocation of 200 new 800 numbers per week has now been
changed to an average of the new 800 number set up during the last
year. I think this method will much fairer than setting the same level
for all carriers. This should also end the temporary shortage of new
800 numbers.

Subject: Observations on The 800 Situation


:-) 
 
First, the good news.   
 
I had the pleasure today of helping a company who's mistakenly
"disconnect"-coded 800 number was returned to the available pool due
to carrier administrative error (negligence?  spite?  who knows.
Mistakes happen.)
 
But having made and acknowledged the mistake, the carrier took a
"hands-off" attitude, said the number was out of their hands in the
"pool", and they were over their 200-week allotment.  They said they
could not, and would not, do anything.
 
The good news part is, my calls to the DSMI and NASC (individual names
withheld to protect the innocent) were handled efficiently and
cooperatively.  The number was quickly traced, and the problem
rectified.
 
 
Maybe they should provide RespOrg service directly! 
 
:-( 
 
On a more sour note, keeping in mind that the 800 database is *not* shut
down, and that the FCC has placed parameters on *carriers* regarding
*their* weekly allotments of 800's... 
 
1.  I called AT&T this morning and asked if I could get an 800 number.   
 
I was informed that the FCC had *shut down the 800 database* -- that *no*
carriers could provide 800 numbers to *anyone* -- and that I should place
my order with AT&T and go on their "waiting list." 
 
2.  Curiosity got the better of me, and I called MCI this afternoon.  They
said the same thing -- *no* numbers available to *anyone.* 
 
Then they went a step further.  First the rep asked if I'd called any other
carriers today.  I said no. 
 
Then he read me a list of other carriers, including LDDS and LCI, who could
not provide me with 800 service.  This is odd, since both LDDS and LCI were
within their "marketshare allocation", at least for this afternoon, and had
some numbers available. 
 
FYI, both calls were placed to the general 800 numbers for each carrier,
advertised to the public.

Bob, your point is well taken -- but according to some carriers' tariffs,
your suggestion could place your clients at risk of being accused of
"warehousing,"  and subject to possible confiscation.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I thought the term 'warehousing' and the
implications thereof only applied to carriers -- not to end users. For
example, suppose I as an end user have a dozen or a half-dozen 800 numbers
which I pay some carrier to supply to me. Now suppose for my own conven-
ience I choose not to use several of those 800 numbers, simply holding
them until I need them -- but I *am* paying the carrier some monthly fee
for these. Am I 'warehousing' the numbers and subject to having them
confiscated?  How is it my service can be taken away from me based on
how much or how little I choose to use it as long as I am paying the
monthly minimum? Nor are my 800 numbers published, nor do I encourage
their use by the general public. There are a lot of companies with 800
numbers that are not published. 

Tell me this Judith: the 'property rights in 800 numbers' that you and
many others espouse; does this hold true also for small residential 800
number users such as myself or am I going to wake up some day in the
future and find myself getting hustled by some large company in dire need
of an 800 number who can't get one and decides to rip-off mine one way
or another?  What if I have two 800 numbers here, or five or ten? Is 
someone going to come along and say 'big business needs those more than
you do' and grab them from me?  What's your outlook on this?   PAT]

Pat,

Every time the phone rings or every time the phone is answered?

I had a client, a small non-profit, that was *fortunate* enough to be on
national television. The network put their 800 number on the screen during an
interview. They had the capability of answering 6 simultaneous calls only.
They were billed nearly $20,000. mostly for unanswered calls. The exposure
damn near killed them.

We got a substantial credit for them and re-cemented their relationship
with the carrier.


Regards,

*BOB*


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: That is a good point. I believe 800 charges
only apply on the same basis as any other long distance charges, that is
when the call supervises, when someone/something answers the line. There
should be no charge for unanswered calls, and if calls > 6 were ringing
open somewhere in the long distance carrier's network or the local telco
network then something was wrong. Calls > 6 should have been returned to
the calling party as busy. You did the right thing in working this out
for them. Did I ever mention the 'million dollar phone call' Amoco was
charged for once when AT&T messed up the supervision on one of their 800
numbers used for credit card verification? It seems AT&T started super-
vising on schedule but 'forgot' to stop supervising on a call for a *long*
period of time -- several weeks or months I guess -- and when the connect-
ion was finally (manually) taken down and supervision stopped, no one
bothered to actually report this analomy to the business office people.

But my point originally was that on *legitimate connections* where someone
asks for connection to your number and telco in good faith puts through
the call, then you owe the money. Whether or not the call was a worthless,
foolish waste of your time and money is irrelevant. Telco cannot make
those decisions for you.  PAT]

Subject: Re: FCC Acts to Conserve 800 Numbers


The part about paying for calls intended for the previous holder
reminds me of another case: it was not about a previous holder, but
was the result of Howard Stern making up an 800 number (regarding
"suicide doctor" Jack Kevorkian) which turned out to be the number of
a vacation-home rental firm, which thus got swamped with calls.

I have seen the term "warehousing" in discussion of non-toll-free areas,
such as in New York City.  How does this FCC action reconcile with the
notion that no one shall be denied service due to number shortage?


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Now here the recipient of the calls and
person/company guarenteeing payment to telco has a definite cause for
action against someone else, namely nasty Howard Stern. I hope they
sued him for the cost of the calls, the loss of their phone line for
use in the way they wanted to use it, the salaries of the persons who
had to be pressed into emergency duty answering the calls, etc. The phone
traffic would not have occurred on its own in the normal conduct of 
business otherwise.  PAT]

Bob:

I do not have a fool proof solution, but a technique to help.  If you
are going to install an 800 number for a few billing cycles before
publishing it, try this: Have your long distance carrier set up access
only from one remote area code.  Anyone else calling will get a
message saying that the number cannot be accessed from their calling
area and the new owner will not be charged.  More customers of the old
owner should begin to get the idea.  Make sure that the carrier does
not charge you for changing the area code tables.

This should reduce the number of calls from the old owner that the new
owner has to pay for when the new owner starts to use the number.
When the new owner wants to begin using the number, he should turn it
on universally, or anywhere where he/she thinks they might get legit
calls.

While this technique requires advanced planning, it could be helpful.
Alternatively, if you do get hit with a large number of wrong numbers,
work on your carrier.  While they may have policies that say that wrong
numbers are your responsibility, LD is very competitive, and you should 
always give them a chance to make you happy.<grin>

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Except that many carriers rightly believe
that if a customer is going to be a chronic write-off; a constant source
of demands for credit, etc, then its just as well to let him move on to
some other carrier who will have him. After all, anywhere you go carrier-
wise with your 800 number, those wrong-number calls are going to follow
you. If I were a carrier and you came to me boo-hooing that your 800
line gets lots of wrong-number calls and that your present carrier had
gotten tired of crediting you (and believe me, I *would* find that out
before signing you to a contract; the carriers do talk to each other 
about stuff) then I would look rather askance at taking you as a customer.
I guess it would depend on the overall volume of business you were going
bring me but if the ultimate bottom line looked too crappy based on all
the goodwill write-offs you'd been given, I'd not want you.  PAT]

Thanks to Pat for the historical background.

The most important point was that operator's were _trained_.  When I had
PBX training, all of the Bell System literature focused on providing
quality service, more than just connecting this plug into that jack.

I think that attitude of "service quality" is missing from the
training of most operators/receptionists today as well as most voice
mail designers, which is shame.  And businesses wonder why people
scream at them when someone finally answers the phone.

Experienced operators did overlap, holding a cord in each hand or the
like.  For instance, as soon as you gave your number, she was answering
the next call while plugging you into the jack and ringing.  It was
amazing to watch the cords fly of experienced operators.

In the old days, most companies required "Bell Training" to be hired as
a PBX operator, that is a girl had to first work for Bell.  Turnover at
Bell was high -- I think pay was on the low side and operating conditions
demanding.  (Men were not considered for operator jobs until the 1970s
except in special areas.)

On cord PBXs, the busy test was the reverse as Pat described -- when
touching the plug tip against the jack rim, a very loud click would be
heard meaning the line was busy.  Trunk lines had indicator lamps so you
didn't have to test them.

Switchboard cords are held down by weights and pulleys, not springs.

I believe Pat got in backwards in one respect -- for busy test the
operator would hear a click if the line was busy, no click if it was
idle.

I grew up in a small town where the switchboard had about 1500 customers max.
The operation is pretty much as Pat described, except this was a cheap
switchboard for small towns and it used magnetic bullseye signals instead of
lamps.  (Western Electric 9-D)  With lamps you can get more lines in front
of an operator, but you need racks of relays in the next room to control
the lamps.  There were about a dozen operator positions, of which less than
half were the toll end and the rest were local.

The cord pairs were in three colors, red, green, and gray, as an aid to
operators in tracing them when things got messy.  The #9 boards used 1/4"
plugs, #310.  Some other boards used 3/16" diameter 309 plugs so they could
put the jacks closer together and get more in front of the operator.

The local board had to deal with up to four party lines; and I guess there
was a section of the board equipped to handle coin lines as well.  For two
parties the phone numbers had a suffix of 'J' or 'W'.  For four parties they
added 'M' and 'R'.  I have no idea what those letters stand for, if anything.

The toll boards had deeper keyshelves; as I recall there was a route
chart under glass on the keyshelf.  There wre Calculagraphs between
each two toll operators, for timing toll calls.  On the toll boards
there were magnetic shutter drops for the ringdown lines - also I
believe there were a few local magneto lines that probably terminated
on the toll board.  I'm not clear on the trunking between local and
toll boards.  I remember if you wanted to make a long distance call
you would say "long distance" in response to "number, please" and the
local operator would connect you over a trunk to the toll end of the
board.  But for incoming toll calls I don't remember if the toll end
of the board had multiples of the calling jacks for all the local
lines, or if they had to go over a trunk to the local end of the
board.  The toll board cord circuit was more complicated than that of
the local board.  For one thing, it had to distinguish between local
lines where it had to supply battery and toll/magneto lines where it
didn't.  Also it had a splitting key on each cord circuit so the
operator could talk to one end of the connection without the other end
hearing.

There was a magneto phone on the end of the switchboard for emergency
use.  It was wired to special cords at several positions.  I guess it was
for use in case the commercial power failed and the office batteries
ran down; or the main fuse on the office batteries blew; or something
like that.  It looked just like an ordinary farm magneto phone except
there were buttons on it for party ringing.

There was a chief operator's desk in the room, behind the row of operators.
This had a row of jacks, one per switchboard position, so the chief operator
could monitor the work of any operator.  There was a gas light hanging
from the ceiling so they could have light in case of electric power
failure.  And there were a number of oscillating fans mounted on the wall;
this was before air conditioning was widespread.

Just a few weeks ago my elderly aunt was telling me that in her youth
the office was in the same place, but the operation was much smaller;
she had a friend who was an operator and she would sometimes spend the
night in the switchboard room keeping her friend company.

This particular switchboard never had a dialing capability, except for one
odd operation.  The office was the base of a Highway Mobile Radio Telephone
system, which used dialing to select a mobile unit to ring.  So one of
the switchboard positions had a dial mounted on it, and an extra cord
associated with the dial.  So the one and only outward dialing trunk
to the radio system had two jacks, one for the talking path and one for
the dial.

The chief operator had several little bottles of paint of various colors.
Sometimes she would put a little dab of colored paint next to a jack on
the switchboard.  I don't know what these stood for.

I've read that in the early days of telephone switchboards there was a
terrible problem with dust getting into the jacks; one wire chief reported
he had made a big funnel that would fit over the face of the switchboard
and connect to a vacuum cleaner to try to suck the dust out of the jacks.
One solution to this problem was in the use of line and cutoff relays.
The jacks were simple open-circuit jacks.  The line relay detected the
customer's telephone going off hook and lighted the switchboard lamp.
The cutoff relay was operated by the sleeve of the jack when an operator
plugged in, and disconnected the line relay.  I guess the dust problem was
solved, or was considered unimportant, by the time of the #9 switchboards
because they did use break contacts in the jacks.  The multiple went through
all the jacks using the normal-through contacts.  Then in at the end of the
chain the contacts led to the magnetic signals for the lines.  So plugging
in anywhere in the multiple would disconnect the magnetic signal from
the line.

The #9D switchboard operated on 24 volts DC.  There was a #9C model that
used 36 volts, for use in places where line resistances ran too high for
24 volts.  Normal practice with dial offices is to use 48 volts.  I don't
know the voltage used by other models of manual switchboards.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: For cleaning and maintainence purposes,
the technician could take the wooden panel off the back side of the larger
switchboards and almost walk inside, or certainly lean well inside to
clean the relays and fix broken wires, etc. A lot of the old switchboards
had the magneto crank on the end of the board so that in the event of
a power failure the operator could turn the little crank by hand while
holding the ringing key in place. The 'paint' you referred to was actually
nail polish of various colors. The little dots of water removalable paint
were there for some sort of bookeeping/accounting reasons. I think it
had to do with who did and did not get toll service; stuff like that.  PAT]

Subject: Manual Toll Cord-Boards in the DDD Era
Date: Wed, 21 Jun 95 08:05:00 GMT


For about a year in 1980/81, I lived in Spokane WA. The city was a mixture 
of Step, #5Crossbar, and #1ESS, just like New Orleans was at that time. 
While New Orleans had TSPS since the mid 70's or earlier, Spokane was still 
using manual cord board toll operators. Even tho' there was ESS, there was 
NO 0+ dialing from Spokane. The only automated customer toll was 1+ 
non-coin. All collect/third-party/card/person, ALL toll from payphones 
(including station-sent-paid) and hotel/motel/PBX HAD to be placed on a
dial-0 (0-) basis.

I had a chance to visit the main Pacific-Northwest-Bell/AT&T building in 
downtown Spokane. It housed the local ESS switch which served downtown area 
(MAdison-4, RIverside-7, and TEmple-8) which had been Step a few years 
earlier, a Step 'tandem' for calls to/from nearby rural locations (also 
step) within the Spokane metro local calling area, the Spokane #4XB Toll 
switch (including a then-still-working 'Card-Translator' machine), and the 
main Operator's Room.

As I stated, Spokane did NOT have TSPS even as late as 1980/81. The manual 
cordboard room was not as large (or I should say as 'long and narrow') as I 
would have expected - it had modern florescent lighting and carpeting and a 
'contemporary' paint color scheme. The building itself probably dated back 
to the 1920's. I couldn't say as to how many operator positions there were 
(this was 15 years ago), but the boards were not that tall. Each switch in 
town had dedicated trunk appearances at the board, in seperate Coin and 
Non-Coin banks. There was a 'keyset' rather than a dial, and the keys were 
NOT arranged in a matrix grid, but rather two columns of five, along with 
'KP', 'ST', and of course (Coin) 'collect' and 'return'. There were also not 
as many jacks/appearances across the face of the board as I would have 
expected. The operators also also were still writing out toll tickets at 
that time. There were outgoing trunk jacks/appearances for the #4XB, 
Information, Repair Service, Police, Fire, etc.

I was only living in Spokane for about two months when the Mt.St.Helen's 
volcano erupted. Altho' the volcano was well over 200 or 300 miles to the 
southwest, Spokane was covered with the ash. I tried calling my parents in 
New Orleans and it took about a week of frequent attempts before finally 
reaching them. The payphone were I was staying at the time was having 
trouble getting dialtone (of course), and I remember losing a several 
nickels/dimes. (in 80/81, Spokane was 15 cents local, untimed, 
coins-first/ground-start). Sometimes after depositing 15c and getting 
dialtone, I would dial 0 and then -- nothing -- sometimes the coins would 
return, other times they would get stuck!(and collected). When (If) I would 
get an operator, she would say something like 'I'm sorry -- but I cannot get 
a trunk out -- my board is LIT UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE' or even if she could 
get a trunk on her board, the call would be blocked somewhere in the #4XB 
switch or toll network.

Most of my calls back to New Orleans as that time were collect calls, 
usually from that same payphone. When I moved back to New Orleans, I looked 
back at my Dad's South Central Bell bills, and it stated collect from 
509-46?-0000. It ALWAYS showed 0000 as the last four digits -- I don't 
remember what the third digit of the NNX was, but it was a valid one for 
Spokane, but seemed to be a 'default' for all NON-sent-paid calls.

Different 0 operators answered the line in different ways -- some answered 
'Operator, may I help you' while some answered with their first name or 
their position number -- some came on the line 'Pacific Northwest Bell, may I 
help you' and you ALSO got an occasional operator who would answer 'Long 
Distance, may I help you'. I never got one answering 'AT&T' nor 'Number 
Please', tho'.

That's 'bout all I can remember right now -- BTW, while I was still there in 
80/81, there were some cuts of local switches from Step or Crossbar over to 
ESS. When I left in May 81, they still had no TSPS and there was ONE non-ESS 
switch still in the city (FAirfax - some FA-x was step, others were 
crossbar).

IMHO, there will be a bit of both reselling AND facilities based services.

Already the Bells and larger independents have IntTRA-LATA TOPS
operators handling multiple LATAS for InTRA(only)-Lata 0-/0+ calls.
Telco Repair and Business Office centers are not necessarily in the
Lata you are calling from, and I think that telco is using its OWN
'corporate' network, something that THEY retained from AT&T in 1984.
The larger Indep's (GTE, Centel, Contel, United, Alltel, etc) probably
had their OWN 'corporate' networks PRIOR to 1984 (just like non-telco
corporations have had their own microwave, VHF/UHF radio, fiber, etc).
When Bell's Business Office or Repair Service or any administrative
office calls me back, from ANY SCBell or BellSouth location - out of
LATA (which includes out of State), I get a line or trunk number along
with SCB or BST or BSM (BellSouth Mobility) or SCBTC or whatever on my
Caller-ID box -- and it has been that way ever since we have had
caller-ID. They ARE calling me via their OWN corporate network.

GTE-Hawaii and AT&T each compete against each other for international
and even some domestic, as do AT&T and (formerly RCA)Alascom. They
also are probably re-selling each-others facilities for situations
where one doesn't have their own facilities.

Already there is a 'disconnected' LATA -- a single lata which has TWO
distinct but contiguous geographic regions -- United's Lima-Mansfield
OH. Has United used AT&T or someone else to connect an intra-lata (via
United) call between the two points? I would think not -- United
probably has its OWN trunking between its toll/tandems and to its
individual United class-5 local exchanges within its two-segment LATA.

I think that the MAJOR indep's and the Bells will establish facilities
where they might not have them - or need to expand facilities -- same
goes for larger Cable, Power, Gas, Water, Transit(rail/bus) utilities
which may enter voice telephone service. Smaller indep's will probably
resell larger companies facilities while establishing SOME kind of
facilities where economically feasible.

Already there are some indep's (not subject to the FULL MFJ stipulations) 
which ARE reselling inTER-LATA facilities. Here in Louisiana, East
Ascension Tel.Co.(EATEL) which serves Ascension Parish (not county)
east of the Mississippi River is part of the SCBell Baton Rouge LATA, 
but they ALSO offer EATELNET service -- voice/data/fax/etc. and even
has their OWN 10-XXX+ code.  I THINK that you can EVEN presubscribe to
EATELNET as your primary 1+/0+.

And then there are the (as I call them) 'Super-Lata's) in the northeast - 
Philadelphia area - PA/NJ - joint services across LATA boundaries provided 
by Bell Atlantic's NJBell & PABell; New York City area - NY/NJ - joint cross 
LATA service by BellAtlantic's NJ Bell and NYNEX' NYBell. There ARE 10-XXX+ 
codes, and you CAN presubscribe -- but if you do -- you canNOT 1+/0+ (nor 
011+/01+) outside of those 'super'LATA regions -- you would have to 10-XXX+ 
first.

Subject: Finding Out Whether a Canadian Phone Number is Unlisted
Date: Thu, 22 Jun 95 00:18:49 GMT
Organization: Queensland University of Technology, Australia


Dear all,

How can I find out if a Canadian phone number is unlisted?

I am looking for a relative, and her surname is "Kowallek" and she
lives in Canada.  I am having trouble finding out whether she has a phone
and if it is unlisted.  On the listed CD rom it doesn't come up with
any listed names.  


Thanks for your help.

h.luke@qut.edu.au


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Forget about the CD rom for the time
being. Those things are notoriously inaccurate for various reasons.
Do you know what city/province your relative lives in? If so, get the
area code for that city or province and try 555-1212. If you do not
know the city/province, can you make a reasonable guess at it for
starters? There are not nearly as many area codes in Canada as there
are in the USA, and several of the provinces have one code for the
entire province. In a couple cases, two or three provinces share a
single area code. If you have to, you can simply go through them one
at a time one after another. You'll be getting the most accurate and
up-to-date information available. 

Now -- how do you *phrase* your questions to the directory assistance
operator to get the most bang for your buck; the most information
possible?  In most cases you begin by asking for a check of the entire
area code or province (if one code takes it all in). Generally they
can do that. If you asked, for example, for a person in Toronto, and
the person did not live in Toronto but actually lived in London, Ontario,
many operators would not volunteer the fact that the name you asked 
about is located there instead. So you don't go city by city, ask up
front for the operator to scan everything available to her. 

You ask her to search for the last name 'Kowallek', period. If she has
any, she is probably going to reply to you that she has several, and do
you have a first name or town. Give her that if you have it *but only
after you started her searching for the last name in general*.  In other
words, you let her tell you if she has any or not, then you be the judge
of which ones you want to search further.

Normally, a non-published number is replied to differently than the 
absence of any listing at all. The operator may say, "I do not see that
name listed at all" or the response may be "there is one but it is a
non-published number". At least with DA as opposed to the Rom, the absence
of anything at all usually means there is no such person, period. With the
Rom, its hard to say what they mean.

If the operator has one, and it is non-pub, it is useless to sit there
and argue with her or try to pump for details. Non-pub means the operator
is not permitted to reveal ANYTHING -- address, first name, and certainly
not the phone number -- that you don't already know. If she has a non-pub
for your party then your reply to the operator is 'are we talking about the
one living in Edmonton?' (Whether you know the city or not is immaterial,
you just bluff and say something. Many operators will respond saying 'no,
this one is in Hamilton' or something like that.  Good ... now you have a
bit more. HANG UP AND CALL BACK TO D.A. Now we inquire about Kowallek in
Hamilton. Again you are going to be told it is non-pub, and your response
is, 'there seems to be some confusion operator; are we talking about Ethel
in Hamilton?' She will say yes or no. 

In case it has not occurred to you, we now call back a third time to
directory asking for Ethel Kowallek on Main Street. I'll bet you anything
the operator is going to reply 'the Ethel Kowallek I have listed is on
<true street name> with a non-pub number'.  Thank you ... call number four
or is this call number five ... you want the number of Ethel Kowallek at
1234 True Street Name in Hamilton. You don't care if that is correct or
not because the operator is going to tell you ... 'I have none at that
address, there is an Ethel Kowallek in the 2600 block of True Street, but
she has a non-pub number.' Very good operator!  Next call: you want the
number of Ethel Kowallek at 2615 True Street. What do you suppose the
operator is going to say?  "It is at 2637 True Street, but non-pub".

In other words, the more you mine, the more you find the diamonds you
are looking for. Any directory assistance operator is going to tell you
flat out she can reveal nothing but that she *can* confirm information
you provide for the sake of making sure you are both talking about the
same party, etc. So once you zero in on the name you want in a town that
seems likely, you start bluffing as though you *already knew the address*.
Over the course of maybe three or four phone calls, possibly up to a 
dozen, operators will bit by bit and piece by piece give you little clues
as to the person's address *as long as they think you are actually giving
that information to them*  <grin>.      PAT]

including Land Mobile Radio Communications Engineering, Radar,
Underwater Acoustics, and Remote Sensing. Several studentships are
available in the Wave Scattering Research group. The nature of the
research is theoretical/numerical.

The Land Mobile Radio Propagation research is concerned with the
development of propagation modelling software techniques
(computational electromagnetics) for radio communication environments.
The approach to propagation modelling is strictly physical
transforming a representation of the scattering surfaces (buildings,
terrain etc.) into a map of channel characteristics (expected
spatially variant system function).

The studentships cover subsistence and tuition fees and shall be
tenable for up to three years. Applicants should ideally hold or
expect to obtain a first class honours primary degree (or equivalent
or higher qualification) in one of the following areas:

Electronic/Electrical Engineering
Theoretical Physics
Applied Mathematics
Computer Engineering

Interexchange carriers use power transmission structures typically
as rights of way.  An armored fiber cable replaces the ground wire
on the transmission structure.  Hence the name Fiber Optic Groundwire,
or FOGwire.  This type of construction is generally much more costly
than buried fiber - the cable is more expensive and installation is
best done by helicopter.  But it's cost-effective over very rough/rocky
terrain where buried fiber would be impractical/impossible.  The
pleasant thing about FOGwire is that it doesn't require physical locates
whenever someone wants to work along the right-of-way - and nobody digs
it up.  Gets shot at now and again, but it's hard to hit.  Very nice
alternative to digging in the dirt.  Power companies are making some
lucrative deals with carriers for "pole rights" - good business usually
for both parties.

When I was in college, our campus radio station transmitted over the
power wires. We had a transmitter on each of the quadrangles and at
the woman's dorm. (This was VPI in 1960, 6000 men and 75 women) The
advantage was that the signal was available in the dorms, but not off
campus. WUVT did not need a license to operate, and student blunders
did not get to the FCC.

The problem with carrier current is that it does not go through power
transformers. We had transmission lines in the steam tunnels, and a 
coupling box at every transformer vault. 

I live in a rural area and am the only house on my transformer. I
would not be able to use carrier current to communicate around the 
neighborhood unless everyone was coupled to the high voltage line
on top of the pole. I am not sure whether we have 4800, 9600, or
15000 volts on our pole, but I am not interested in messing with it.

The carrier current signal is coupled between the black (hot) wire
and the white (ground) wire. The power wiring acts like a transmission 
line. Granted the impediance is widely variable and not constant, but
at low and medium frequencies standing waves are not a big problem.
(Because the run is less than a wavelength).

The power companies do couple to their high voltage lines and use them
for voice and data. I don't think they use carrier current for local
distribution loops (ie from the substation to the neighborhood)
although the are able to recognize a lot of outages. There may be some
signalling on some of the wires. Does anyone from the power companies
want to enlighten us?

Hi Greg:

As an old DMS support guy, I can tell you your problem is economics,
not technology. The DMS-10 is old but with CCS7 and proper software
and hardware, it CAN deliver CLID. Unfortunately, your local company
is not likely to want to sink that investment into an older
(depreciated) switch at this time unless they figure they will get a
big take on the CLID and other revenue generators it can bring.

Your last, best hope (for all you Babylon 5 fans), is that they have a
DMS-100 host (or similar) and that they might put a DMS-RSC remote in
your area that will support all the digital finery you desire.

By the way, the DMS-10 is ancient by high tech standards (over 15
years I beleive). The DMS was a big thing when it first came out as it
was the first "all digital" switch ... line card codec and all. When I
left my support position, one of our DMS-100s had over 65,000
subscribers.  It ran over 25 million lines of code in real time ...
the second largest real time system in the world, they said.

A technophiles dream ... a tech-support persons nightmare!!!

Have a great day and good luck with your CLID.

The big issue/question: what is the cost of universal service?
The big problem: who will tell us?
The big answer: the former monopolist operators.

My question is now which incentive will they have to tell us the truth?

According to BT, their access deficit for 1992/93 (one year) was #1.45
billion, According to a note from Tele Danmark to the Danish ministry Tele
Danmark has no need whatsoever for a universal service fund, nor for
access deficit charges to fulfill their universal service obligation.

How can this be possible? How can one company have such a major deficit
and another company no problem whatsoever.

The universal service problem has not been solved yet, we have barely
scratched the surface. In view of this all, I would be very interested how
the universal service problem has been attacked in the US (perhaps not
federally but on the level of the States). There has been a statement by
Al Gore where he mentioned in passing the so-called pay-or-play principle
(you either play and provide universal service, or you pay so that others
can provide it). If anyone could point me in the direction of a concrete
case where this principle has been applied i would be greatful.

Next time you call someone, try using your rotary dial.  Odds are
it will hang you up if you dial 3 or higher.  Or, if you dial 1 or 2,
you may activate extended services like three-way calling or forwarding.
The real ansser for this is voice recognition - fairly reliable, and
quite expensive.

Many IVR systems use T1 (digital phone line) technology.  The protocol
does not generally allow for hook-flash call redirection.  As a result,
expensive hardware is frequently required to allow the call to connect
somewhere else.

Most systems use star for abort/backup, and pound for enter.  There is
an official industry standard document for recommended IVR conventions.
It should be mandatory reading for IVR app developers.

In general, it is a good practice to kick callers out when they can't 
figure out what's going on.  A poorly written system may let you enter
an infinite loop, but it should at least kick you out after three mistakes
at any given voice prompt.  This makes life a little harder for hackers.

In theory, your suggestions are a good idea, and I don't think people
will disagree with your assessment of the frustration IVR systems may
give you.  Keep in mind that there are two kinds of systems you seem
to be describing as one here: automated attendants, and voicemail.
Voicemail is exactly that, and should really be no more.  Automated
attendants really need to be well written in order to avoid confusion
and frustration.  But, the market rules here, and if businesses lose
customers because of a poorly written IVR application, that application's 
writer will find itself with no new business.  The market should weed
out the junk.

Sorry this is so late.  I didn't see any response to this.

Here is how it works in my house.

One of the features we get from the telco is Call Hold.  This allows
us to put calls on hold by doing a hookflash and then dialing *9#.
If we then hang up the phone, it rings back, and then the answering
machine can pick it up.  This is really handy when I am in the
shower and someone wants to leave a message.

For multiple mailboxes, you might consider an answering machine that
I saw at Radio Shack recently.  It has four mailboxes, which I guess
are selectable after a greeting.  A couple of months ago I think they
had it on sale for $129.95.

Calling Card.  If I bite, I receive AT&T Long Distance Gift
Certificates equal to my international Calling Card Usage for
August and September, up to a maximum of $100.

The "new" thing about this card is that the number is between seven

my phone number without the area code.  (BTW, AT&T let on that they
had real-time ANI by reciting my phone number when I spoke with them.)

Now, I already _have_ an AT&T Calling Card, and I don't see any good
reason to get one with a different number.  But they won't ("no one
can") give me this rebate offer unless I get the new card.  (Ok, I
forgot to ask if I can keep both cards, take advantage of the offer on
the TrueChoice (sm) card, then dump it in October, but they didn't
suggest that to me as an option, either.)

Can someone please tell me _why_ AT&T wants to reward me for changing 
the number on my card?  I'm happy with my 864 XXX XXXX XXXX as my

not seem to understand is that when you connect a computer to a telephone
line and offer its services in general to the 'public' you lose whatever
reasonable expectations of 'privacy' you might have regards the computer
files had it not been put on line and if some effort had been specifically
made to keep the public away. To invite the public on the one hand while
saying the 'government' on the other hand is not invited is silly. If you
offer some spectacle for public consumption/viewing then members of the
public who work for the government are equally free to observe whatever
it is. Remember the fuss over the Oklahoma City affair? The senator said
government agents attended PUBLIC meetings as observers. Objections were
made that that was 'unconstitutional' and violated the rights of the people
at the meeting. Of course it isn't and of course it doesn't. The public
consists of all the public. Being a government employee does not make you
any less a member of the public. Being a police officer does not make you

As readers of the TELECOM Digest are aware, the use of interchangable NPAs
has caused more than a few problems.  I was listening to the "Don and Mike
Show" yesterday (a nationally syndicated radio program).  The show
originates near Washington, DC, but gets calls from all over the US.  They
were starting one of their contests and got a call from Mobile, Alabama.
The call got dropped accidentally and what happened next was interesting.
They had the callback number for Mobile, but the people on the air knew the
Mobile area code (334) couldn't be reached through their normal PBX lines.
They started to use a direct outside line to call the contestant back.
Unfortunately, the contest required two simultaneous calls to Mobile so,
they invoked the ultimate solution ... "Next caller!"  

Another example of high cost of interchangable NPAs.

Thwarting 'Softlifters'

Microsoft is trying out an anti-software-pirating effort in England,

consists of disks and a workbook designed to help companies understand
software issues and audit thier systems.

Another attack against what Microsoft terms "softlifting" also is in
the offing.  Microsoft officials confirm that beta versions of Windows
95 include a small viral routine called Registration Wizard.  It
interrogates every system on a network gathering intelligence on what
software is being run on which machine.  It then creates a complete
listing of both Microsoft's and competitors' products by machine,
which it reports to Microsoft when customers sign up for Microsoft's
Network Services, due for launch later this year.  Customers must
actively disable the routine if they don't want it to run.

Ah, but with the microscopic call setup time of ISDN, it seems (technicall)
possible to have a "dial on demand" kind of agreement with your provider
which would provide the appearance of a permanent connection with (hopefully)
less expense (depending on how popular your site was with incoming users).

I've often wondered if anyone will be providing this kind of service. It

the typical rates today for a full time internet connection.

instead of the DMS-10 software being available to provide it.  

In 2nd quarter of 1992, Northern Telecom(NORTEL) provided the industry

Then in December 1994, software generic 406.10 provided additional

Oh, please. There's also a kid in England who's dying of a brain tumor

Or something like that.

The following correction was circulated on Usenet about a month ago, but 
bears repeating in this forum:

  From: ASaunders@aol.com
  Subject: re: Microsoft plans corporate espionage

A recent trade publication article contained inaccuracies regarding the
purpose and operation of the Registration Wizard, the on-line registration
application in Windows 95.  The purpose of the Registration Wizard is to
offer an electronic version of the paper-based Registration Card that
traditionally comes with all Microsoft products.  The Registration Wizard
asks for similar information to that listed in the paper-based registration
card, such as your hardware configuration and applications usage.  Just like
with a traditional registration card, providing this information is
optional.  A customer using the Registration Wizard receives dialog prompts
asking them whether they would like to send this information.  They must
actively click 'send' for any information to be sent.

There are lots of benefits to customers that provide this information - such
as product update mailings and improved product support because the product
support engineer can refer to your exact system configuration information
on-line.  In the end, though, sending this information is optional and a
conscious decision by the user.

Microsoft traditionally does not make information gathered during the
registration process available to third-parties.  If the customer chooses to
send system and software information to Microsoft with the Registration
Wizard, it is a one-way, one-time occurrence and takes place at the time the
customer selects 'send.'

Unfortunately (as I was still in diapers) I don't know what the
equipment looked like, but in 1960 my parents moved into an old house
in the country.  At the time they bought it, it had no fancy indoor
plumbing and no phone.  My dad told me that the first installation of
a phone was indeed over the power line.  He described a "box" that the
phone was plugged in to.  He indicated that it worked just fine and
the quality was just as good as any other phone he had used in town.

I think this condition lasted for a couple or three years till the
phone company ran dedicated copper to the house.  My parents farm is
at the extreme edge of service for Monroe City MO and we were on a
party line for a good number of years.  I still look up and listen
intently for a short period of time when I hear a non-standard ring
pattern.  I guess I still think I need to count the number of rings to
see if it is for me :)

We had some kind of stepper switch until about '67 or so.  I remember
my mom telling me that we had to start dialing seven digits instead of
four ...  I kinda wish I was more phone literate back then.  It would be
fun to know more of the details of phone service in that small town
while I was growing up.

Subject: Communications Decency Act Part II
Date: Fri, 23 Jun 95 16:48:54 GMT
Organization: Online Orlando


I checked on thomas.loc.gov today and noticed that the final version of the 
communications reform bill was available. On checking on the communications 
decency act section, I saw that there were significant changes in the 
language from the version I previously reported to telecom. I have appended 
the revised version. The orginal HTML version is a lot easier to read than
this ASCII version. 

Paragraph (f) (1) addresses some concerns I mentioned in my first post,
about the possible liability of someone who simply provides access for
a minor to the Internet. It still looks to me like running a Usenet news
server will be a crime, if you let a minor have access to it.

I'm also puzzled by the second sentence in (f) (1):

>   `(1) No person shall be held to have violated subsections (a),
> (d), or (e) solely for providing access or connection to or from
> a facility, system, or network over which that person has no
> control, including related capabilities which are incidental to
> providing access or connection. This subsection shall not be
> applicable to a person who is owned or controlled by, or a
> conspirator with, an entity actively involved in the creation,
> editing or knowing distribution of communications which violate
> this section.

The phrase "person who is owned', sounds like a reference to slavery.
Maybe is has a special meaning in a legal context.

Does anyone know of a source for Telex modems.

These rare buggers act as an interface between the telex line and a
computer.

We are using a few in our organization currently, but the manufacturer
no longer exists. (Taken by aliens or something to that effect.)

I want to have a supplier in case the ones we have die.

I have heard rumors the a company called HASLER is know to make them.

And how do they define the term, virus? How are they able to distinguish
a virus from a Java program or a buggy database? Is this merely a case
of, they'll know one when they see one?

If a virus is a program which runs on a user's machine without request
or consent by the user, then Java may fit. The intention is certainly
to run programs on a user's machine transparently to the user. You might
argue implied consent, but it might not be *informed* consent.

If a virus is a program which runs on a user's machine and damages that
system or data stored on it, then any commercial software with a known
but un-fixed bug may fit.

There may be answers to these questions, but I haven't heard them and
I'd much appreciate hearing them. But then, the Finnish regulation seems
only to ban distribution of virii *with consent*, that is, at the explicit
request of the customer. The continued permission to distribute such
programs privately would seem to make it still legal to deliberately
infect another machine. Is there some other rule covering that situation?

Subject: India May End Absurd Datacom Licence Fees


India's Department of Telecommunications charges BBSes $50,000 and
e-mail providers $80,000 in annual licence fees, though few pay. I
spoke to R K Takkar, Secretary DoT and Chaiman Telecom Commission, who
admitted he needed to "be educated" on the differences between telecom
and datacom economic models. Although the comment of P N Bhagwati, a
former Chief Justice of India known for strong views on rights, that
the licence fees would be struck down in court, is in another article,
this one details the DoT's present and possible future datacom policy.

The Indian Techonomist, Sample issue, June 1995

Bandwidth restraint

How excessive regulation hurts India's promising data communications
industry, and what the government appears willing do about it.

When, three years ago, India's Department of Telecommunications (DoT)
allowed the entry of the private sector into the "value-added
services" - a quaint term including everything from electronic mail to
radio paging - it ignored reality. It did so again in a strange
notification last year, where it announced annual licence fees of Rs
2.5 million ($80,000) for e-mail providers and Rs 1.5 million
($50,000) for bulletin board services. Electronic bulletin boards
(BBSes) had been active since at least 1991 in India's major cities;
with its notification, far from "constantly endeavouring to upgrade
technologies," as it claimed, the DoT became the major impediment to
the growth of Indian datacom.

The value of India's data communications market (including fax and
networking products) has been estimated at $150 million this year by
Voice and Data magazine. Indians took quite rapidly to fax, once
import duties were low enough for reasonable prices.  They are taking
as well as they can to e-mail, given the limited opportunities, thanks
to the DoT. Astonishingly the DoT is not posing obstacles deliberately, 
but is just not aware of the differences between the economic models
of datacom and telecom - it can't tell a modem from a phone.

This should change soon, for two reasons. First, the 110-year-old
Indian Telegraph Act, from which the DoT draws its power, is under
attack from several directions (see ITK_ITA) - although changes to
such entrenched legislation take time. More encouraging is the
attitude of the DoT itself, or at least of its Secretary, R K Takkar.
In an exclusive interview for The Indian Techonomist Mr Takkar
expressed the DoT's willingness to change the way it behaves towards
datacom.

He accepted that licence fees "should not be looked upon as a source
of revenue" - answering the concern that the DoT wanted a share in the
earnings of datacom service providers over and above that from the
considerable additional telephone traffic generated. He said the
intention of the DoT should not be to make money, and that "at best
the government is entitled to recover its administrative costs"
through such fees. The sole purpose of licencing, Mr Takkar
maintained, was to ensure that the prospective service provider "is
earnest about that business, [will] be able to provide a public
service," and, echoing India's suspicion of foreigners' intentions,
"is a responsible citizen or company."

When it was pointed out that excessive fees curtail the spread of
electronic networks in the country, Mr Takkar agreed that "licence
fees should not be fixed [at a point that] stifles the growth of the
services" as the primary focus "should be on the widest possible
provision of the service." Widespread access to data communications
services, he reiterated, "should be the only objective of determining
the level of licence fee," and offered to "give a serious relook" to
the current fee structure.

Mr Takkar was quick to appreciate the distinction between the huge
investment requirements of telecommunications infrastructure and the
distributed, small-scale nature of Internet and other electronic
networking services. When it was suggested that India was poised for
the proliferation of small Internet service providers, as in the US,
if it were not for the DoT's licencing policies, he repeatedly
expressed that he was open to further inputs. "I would greatly
appreciate meeting [knowledgeable people from the industry]" said Mr
Takkar, "I'd like to be educated."

Bell Canada announces details about new Internet Access Service


(June 21, 1995) -- Bell Canada, participating in the first Canadian 
Internet Conference, today revealed details of the framework for the 
Internet access service it plans to launch before the end of 1995.

Our proposal, still to be finalized,  will provide residence and small 
business customers throughout Bell's territory with reliable, high 
quality and competitively priced access to the Internet.  Bell's service 
will be offered in both English and French.  Currently, Internet access 
service is offered to large business customers through Worldlinx.

The internet conference was held between June 20-22, 1995, at Carleton 
University in Ottawa.


The Service

Bell's  package will offer dial-up Internet access for single users in a 
residence or business environment.  In addition to affordable access, we 
will provide easy-to-use software. As a complete Internet package, Bell 
Canada will offer home access to electronic mail, over 10,000 
professional discussion newsgroups and global information sites like 
gopher and the World Wide Web, and access to a call centre to which 
customers can call for information and assistance.
 

Bell's Internet access service will be offered through <A 
HREF="http://www.worldlinx.com">WorldLinx Telecommunications Inc.</A> (a 
Bell Canada company).  Currently, WorldLinx offers fully dedicated 
corporate high speed (56 kb/s and above) Internet access services over 
WorldLinx LAN/WAN and Stentor Hyperstream networks.  This service 
includes full Internet access (World Wide Web, FTP, Telnet, news feeds, 
etc.) domain name and IP address registration.  As well, WorldLinx 
offers e-mail access to the Internet via TheNet:Mail.

The exact size of the Internet can only be estimated; however,  it is 
growing exponentially, approximately doubling in size each year, and has 
been doing so for at least the past six years. Each year there are as 
many new people on the Internet as all the people on the Internet the 
year before.  Worldwide, there are 80,000 new users joining the Internet 
every day.  In Canada, a growing number of telephone companies are 
already offering Internet access packages.

Bell is responding to the growing demand from our customers to provide 
them with full Internet access service.  A task force has been formed to 
develop a full-service, customer-focused product.

Our vision of the Internet is "Experience the World with Bell".  Access 
to the service will be affordable.  It will provide customers with a 
whole new range of choices -- in learning, entertainment and shopping.  
Above all, the customer will be in control.

Of the many books currently available on the topic of the World Wide
Web, some specialize in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) explanation,
some just enthuse, and a *lot* specialize in the Mosaic browser.  Most
general guides, though, tend to dedicate the bulk of the pages to
various Web sites and presentations.  (Screen dumps are a very quick
way to fill up space.)  Kent doesn't do as much of this, and uses the
space saved to produce the most complete description of WWW that I
have yet reviewed.

After the four chapters of general introduction in part one, part two
provides a raft of information on text, graphical, DOS, Windows, Mac,
UNIX and other browsers.  Even W3 by mail gets mentioned.  Part three
gives some background on establishing a dial-up IP connection.
(Familiarity with modem commands and the Kermit scripting language
would be a help.)  The array of client browsers is presented, with
some analysis, in part four, while the actual operation of the client
software (mostly Netscape and InternetWorks) is detailed in part five.
A quick, but useful, guide to HTML makes up part six.  And, not to be
left out, part seven is a list of W3 sites -- and archives for related
software.
 
The breadth of scope in the book is at some expense of accuracy,
particularly in terms of browser features.  The desire to be current
has led to an annoying number of "stop press" comments -- some run
into the paragraphs they are meant to correct.  Originally, the author
seems to have planned to include InternetWorks with the book.  Some
comments would indicate that the developers withdrew permission at the
last minute and that not all references were removed.  Also, some of
the material is a bit disorganized.  The documentation for text
browsers appears in part two, while the operation of graphical
browsers is described in part four.  A combined overview might have
contributed to overall understanding.
 
Still, even with these flaws, I highly recommend this to anyone who
wants to understand, connect to, use, or start providing information
on the World Wide Web.

Date: 26 Jun 1995 21:55:03 -0400

Two months ago, in mid to late April on a Saturday afternoon, while
sitting in a friend's TV cable-enabled apartment in Chelsea region of
Manhattan, I viewed a television commercial for MFS local phone
service.  A week later (after wandering various phone books and
calling various numbers) I ordered two MFS telephone lines for my
residence (not far from there, also in Manhattan).

The sales person, very polite and cooperative sounding, eventually
worked out all the paperwork necessary and threw in an extra line for
free.  The cost was amazing -- I forget exactly, but $14.50 per month
per line comes to mind.  I was told every feature NYNEX offers on a
line is offered by MFS for no additional cost to their monthly fee.
Also installation is free.  However, there are a few glitches:

A) I'm in the order stage now where NYNEX has to do something (I think
   the part NYNEX has to do is install the lines and route them to the
   MFS equipment co-located in the office for my area, as well as set
   up a call-forwarding for the one number I chose to keep the same).
   This has lasted at least two months.  Repeated calls to the sales
   person go ignored; perhaps she's inundated with these status
   requests?  I haven't had an update or any word for about six weeks
   or so, except for today I received a mail with the number for MFS's
   customer service when I do get my service working.  A good sign.

B) How can they offer all the same features as NYNEX and know what I
   want?  I want, and already have just about everything: Call Display
   (name also would be nice), call forwarding (delayed and busy and other
   types would be nice as well) with the ability to change it 
   remotely, call waiting, three-way, white pages on modem, and a few
   other things I forget.  Somehow this seems too good to be true, but
   then I'll find out the details when everything gets installed,
   possibly before if they call with info & questions about final
   installation.

To their credit, they are in a new market, and they did say it might
take a month to get things in order from NYNEX's end, although it's
been two months already.  But I can't yet comment on their service,
per-call costs, etc. as those details aren't yet forthcoming.

I do have some contact information for those of you who wish to experience
this fun little exercise in yet more ways to hate NYNEX with an
indirect, free-market twist or two with yet more possibilities of
telephone schizophrenia and disgust as well as a possible, eventual,
metamorphosis of pros and cons:

That was the information given for customer service in the standard

I'll note that calling 1-212-843-7700 reaches a receptionist, and I

Subject: *67 & *82 Behavior With LDDS/WilTel 800 Numbers From Manhattan
Date: 26 Jun 1995 22:10:59 -0400
Organization: URL:http://www.armory.com/~ulmo/ (see rivers.html for PGP key)


Dialing from my local exchange on one of my phones served by NYNEX W18th St office in Manhattan, I tried my own 800 numbers and my WilTel
long-distance calling cards with their 800 number access to call my other
line in my apartment.  In all cases, the behavior was as follows:

*67:  When I first dialed *67, my number display box said "Private".

*82:  When I first dialed *82, my number display box showed the phone number
      I was calling from.

No prefix:  The default on my line is to allow number display, and the
            number was displayed.

I have yet to report on what happens when my friend in California
prefixes my 800 numbers or using my calling cards with *67 from pay phones
or other phones.  Right now, calling my 800 number from California displays
the number of the caller on my number display box.

I was lucky to get 800 numbers which have no previous history and no
mass numbers of misdialers; only one mother from somewhere in 404 has
dialed me five times as a misdial of her son's number that she uses,
and by now has gotten accurate enough in her dialing that she hasn't
made the mistake in months.  But all the numbers she's called from
have displayed on my number display box.

While this all tentatively makes some sense to me, it raises some
interesting questions about what is really going on and what's
intended, i.e., ANI vs. (other?) SS7 data types.

Should I continue to report more of this stuff?

How do the latest FCC decrees apply here?


Bradley


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Yes, by all means continue to make reports
like this when you have them. I am rather amazed that *67 was honored when
an 800 number was being dialed. Tell us if it is honored when your monthly
billing arrives with the numbers listed on that.  Also, what does *82 do
in your case?  PAT]

I saw this in the most recent issue of Computer Underground Digest. Jim
Thomas is usually rather prudent about what he publishes, so I assume
he has done at least some verification of the following:
 
   Date: Fri, 23 Jun 95 14:09:15 EDT
   From: "W. K. (Bill) Gorman" <34AEJ7D@CMUVM.CSV.CMICH.EDU>
   Subject: FBI to search 30,000+ US homes/businesses

FBI plans to search upwards of 30,000 American homes and businesses were
"leaked" in a VERY BRIEF mention on the Rush Limbaugh show 6/21/95.
Mr. Limbaugh referred to a USA Today article, presumably of the same
date, which referenced a newspaper in CT as the original source.

According to the article, the FBI, apparently in anticipation of the
passage of the Constitution-aborting Anti-Terrorism bill AND the
equally totalitarian Exon "Communications 'Decency' Act" which has
been attached to the Telecom Reform Act, has leaked plans to conduct
SEARCHES OF THE HOMES AND BUSINESSES OF 30,000+ AMERICANS. Their
rationale for this is the claim that these persons - now get this - MAY
HAVE VIEWED some form of "child pornography", real or morphed, on
their PC screens sometime in the past.

Articles describing this  totalitarian lunacy have also appeared
in the Fort Wayne newspaperson 6/21/95. No mention of it that
I am aware of from TV journalists.  No guts, guys?

Will the feds find it expedient to seize every single piece of computer 
equipment found in these homes, along with any firearms, cash, jewelry, 
other valuables or financial records, regardless of whether or not
anything actually ILLEGAL is found? Past performance indicates that
this is likely to be the case. How many innocent Americans will be
killed in these raids?  How many children?  How many pets will be
tortured to death for the amusement of those conducting the raid, as
was the kitten which was stomped to death by a rogue BATF agent during
the infamous Lamplugh raid, as revealed during testimony before the
Senate Judiciary Terrorism Subcommittee?  Why is anyone who would
perform such a psychotic act permitted to hold a position of
responsibility in government service or law enforcement?

Has Congress lost all touch with reality?  Are they TRYING to see how
many ways they can find to force Americans into the burgeoning militias?
Are they TRYING to make the appellation "jack-booted thugs" actually
synonimous with all federal law enforcement personnel?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: If this is true -- if these intentions
are accurately stated, then I cannot imagine that the mainline media
has not jumped into the fray. I'd like to know if Limbaugh actually said
it (I do not listen to his program) and if he did say it if he quoted
the 'newspaper in CT' where it supposedly appeared, and if that is the
way it actually read in the paper, etc. It seems to me we have enough to
be legitimatly paranoid enough about these days without adding some sort
of second- and third-hand nonsense that someone else may or may not have
said. Remember the childhood game called 'Chinese Telephone'? A large group
of people stand in a circle. The first person writes down *exactly* what
he says to the next person, then he *whispers* it one time, and one time
only. The next person whispers what he thinks he heard to the third person
and so on around the circle from a dozen mouths to a dozen different ears.
No one is permitted to repeat the message; they can utter it one time only
in a whisper to the person next to them. Finally it comes full circle and
the last person says out loud the messsage, for better or worse, that
originally started. Then the originator reads the exact words of the
original message. The difference by the time it reaches the end of the
line can often times be hysterical. 

So, what did Limbaugh *really* say -- if he said anything at all -- about
planned FBI raids? What did the newspaper say, and where was its information
taken from? Is that too much to ask, so we can all be paranoid together
or conversely all laugh together at this latest round of nonsense?   PAT]

Subject: India's Telecom Strike Ends; 80 Bids For Basic Services


--==(C) Copyright 1995 Rishab Aiyer Ghosh (rishab@arbornet.org)

Indian telecom strike ends; 80 bids for basic services

23rd June 1995: The "indefinite" nationwide telecom workers' strike
ended today morning. The strikers protested against the entry of
foreign investors in basic telecom services, especially when public
sector companies such as ITI (which made its first loss in this, its
47th year) are not being permitted to participate in the bids.
Minister for Communications Sukh Ram last night threatened dismissal
of more than 400,000 workers who joined the stike, which had been
declared illegal. This was an unusual move, considering that the
government still does not allow corporate bankruptcy and lay-offs.

Meanwhile, 80 bids were announced for the tender for basic telecom
services.  16 companies, all joint ventures between Indian firms and
foreign firms (with a maximum 49% holding for the latter), bid for all
regions ('circles') of the country apart from the troubled northern
state of Jammu and Kashmir.

The biggest bidder by far was by Reliance Corp, collaborating with
America's Nynex. Reliance, a huge industrial conglomerate with more
shareholders than any other company in the world, was the only bidder
for many poor and remote states that came into the tender's 'C'
category. US West, which is conducting a controversial pilot project
in rural telephony in south India, only bid for fairly wealthy parts
of the country along with its Indian partner, BPL.  India's capital,
Delhi, was the most popular, perhaps because Bombay, the richest
market, came along with the rest of the state of Maharashtra.

Foreign collaborators included Bell Atlantic, Hughes, NTT, AT&T, Deutsche 
Telecom, Telstra, Telecom Malaysia and Israel's Bezeq. Notable absentees 
were Singapore Telecom, Bell South, France Telecom and GTE, all of which 
had previously formed joint ventures with Indian firms. Two surprises
were Moscow Teqlecom, which bid for really backward areas including the
remote Andaman and Nicobar islands south of Myanmar, and PTT Guangdong
of China, which played safe with Delhi.

Compared to the response from 32 companies for the nationwide cellular
services tender on June 7th, that for basic services today was thought
low-key. The complete list of bids will be made available in the Telecom
Archives (ftp://lcs.mit.edu/telecom-archives/) next week.

Subject: 800 Article in July 3 Business Week


A July 3, 1995 {Business Week} article reports that "toll-free 800 numbers
are just about used up." 
 
It quotes attorney Colleen Bothby, who represents such big 800 users as
General Electric and Bank of America, as saying that corporate America is
"very, very concerned." 
 
The article goes on to explain that a surge in demand for the 800 exchange
is partly due to the popularity of personal 800 numbers, such as those
acquired for college kids' use. 
 
It also reports that if the current FCC ration doesn't work, the FCC may
take back some unused 800 numbers. Main target, according to Business Week:
phone companies stockpiling them. 
 
Regarding branded 800's, the article says that many companies with
well-known 800 numbers -- American Express, for instance, which has
1-800-THE-CARD -- are worried someone could grab the corresponding number on
the 888 exchange. It says the FCC may solve that by just eliminating these 
popular numbers from 888.

Bridging the Gap Between Telecom & Marketing 


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: You know, my heart really bleeds for those
people. If Amex is going to dictate what numbers they will and won't allow
to appear in 888, then I want to do the same. I want the FCC to eliminate
all of my personal 800 numbers from duplication on 888, and also on 011-800
for that matter. Do you think they will do it for me?  How in the world
could anyone with a bit of brains manage to mistake 888 for 800 in dialing?
I have a few problems with much of 'corporate America' anyway, but I guess
my major hassle is with the arrogance so many of them are exhibiting where
something as simple as a telephone number is concerned.   PAT]

Subject: Answers to Your 800 Warehousing Questions


On Thu, 22 Jun 1995 TELECOM Digest (Patrick Townson) <telecom@delta.eecs.
nwu.edu> said: 
 
> [TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I thought the term 'warehousing' and the 
> implications thereof only applied to carriers -- not to end users.  
 
Actually, RespOrgs/carriers "hoard."   
 
Re accusations of user "warehousing", there is tariff language among
some carriers, imposed contractually on users, that classifies
"brokering" and "warehousing", separately or together, as "fraud and
abuse."  "Fraud and abuse", traditionally applied to such illegal
activities as selling non-existent real estate by phone, or faking
a dial tone, provide for the only enforcement -- confiscation -- that
carriers have against users. In addition to confiscation, it also
provides for revocation of portability.
 
Needless to say, neither "brokering" nor "warehousing" are illegal
activities.  "Brokering" is simply defined as "releasing for a fee.".  
That places every telemarketing company - and all the companies like
1-800 DENTIST - in contract violation, if their carrier is AT&T or one
of the other carriers that use this tariff language.  "Warehousing"
applies to the very scenario you outline below.
 
> For example, suppose I as an end user have a dozen or a half-dozen
> 800 numbers which I pay some carrier to supply to me. Now suppose for

Yes, according to AT&T's 800 tariff. 
 
> How is it my service can be taken away from me based on 
> how much or how little I choose to use it as long as I am paying the 
> monthly minimum?  
 
Patrick, by using AT&T, you are in contractual obligation with their
800 tariff, and you are voluntarily agreeing to these terms.  The
obvious remedy is to port to a different carrier that does not include
this language in its tariff.
 
FYI, AT&T "anti-warehousing" language was quietly slipped into their
800 tariff about a year ago.  It was submitted to the FCC in the same
document with the anti-pay for 800 MCI 1 800 CALL INFO that got so
much publicity.
 
Furthermore, the tariff language contains no parameters of minimum
usage, packaging (telemarketing, enhanced 800, etc.) or application
(seasonal marketing, etc.).  The language is openly arbitrary and
capricious, and enforceable at the whim of the carrier.

Good questions, Patrick.   
 
I'm a marketing person, so my response takes a marketing point of
view.  Our engineer would probably add a technical twist, our attorney, 
the legal ramifications.
 
So from my point of view: Toll-free service for non-commercial
applications (residential and data service) is a valid and valuable
product characteristic.  There *is* one characteristic of *800*
toll-free service -- mass consumer branding -- that is not relevant for
residential or data use.
 
We propose that residential and data services be moved to a new
toll-free NPA -- preferably one that does not confuse consumers via use
of "8--".  So that residential and pager services, for example, can
retain toll-free benefits, without infringing on the trademarks,
consumer traffic, and business utility of *800* toll-free.
 
FYI, at the recent 888 Implementation Meeting at the FCC,
representatives of the pager industry had no objections to this.

Bridging the Gap Between Telecom & Marketing 


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Well, I don't know about representatives
of the pager industry, but I want to keep my 800 numbers just as Amex
and the florist want to keep theirs. You mention tariff language used
by AT&T, but since I don't have them as my 800 carrier, I guess whatever
they propose to do in their tariffs is of no concern to me. I hope there
is major resistance by residential and small business users of 800 service
to any plan to force us off of 800 and into some other NPA. Heck, let
Amex and the florist move if they don't like our company. If they get
property rights in their numbers then I get property rights in mine also,
right?   PAT]

Subject: Meeting on Toll Free 888 Database Set


                      FCC Announces Second Meeting
            to Discuss Acceleration of Toll Free 888 Database

     The FCC will hold the second in a series of meetings with the
industry to discuss ways to accelerate deployment of the new toll free
888 area code.  These meetings are part of the Commission's overall
plan to conserve use of the existing toll free 800 numbers and
accelerate the availability of the new toll free 888 numbers.

     This meeting on Wednesday, June 28, 1995 will begin at 9:00 a.m. and
is open to the public.  The meeting will be held at Bellcore, Room B1-B2,
2101 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.  A tentative agenda is attached. 

     This second meeting will include reports from various industry
segments, including local exchange carriers, SCP vendors and switch
vendors, on ways to accelerate deployment of the 888 database. 

     The first 888 deployment meeting was held on June 15.  Future
meetings will be held approximately every two weeks throughout
planning for 888 deployment.  All meetings will be open to the public.
Documents from these meetings will be available for public viewing the
day after each meeting at the FCC, 2025 M Street, N.W., Room 6010,
between 9 a.m.  and 5 p.m.  Copies of these documents may be purchased
from the Commission's duplicating contractor, International
Transcription Services, (202) 857-3800.

     The FCC is holding these meetings as part of its overall effort
to smooth the transition from the existing toll free 800 number system
to the new toll free 888 system.  The FCC continues to work with the
800 service provider industry to conserve the existing 800 numbers and
to ensure the efficient use of these resources.

     Questions about this meeting should be directed to Mary De Luca at
(202) 418-1500.

Subject: Telecom News in the Netherlands From the Past Week


On the Dutch telecom field there has been quite some news this past
week.  On Wednesday the competitor of the Dutch PTT, Enertel fell
apart. Enertel was a consortium between the Dutch railways, the joined
cable providers and the American Bell-South. The plan was to set up a
joined network and be operational in 1998. Due to internal disputes
the coalition fell apart. Main subject was the fact that the cable
providers wanted to set up regional networks besides the national
network. The Dutch railways didn't agree with this, and so now they
are both going to try to get their own licence and set up their own
network. Problem in this matter is that current law in the Netherlands
only allows one competitor on the field of ground connections.

Other news is that in some small town in the province of North-Holland
PTT Telecom is going to test new service which will make it possible
to rent a voicemailbox at the PTT switching. Then when the subscribers
number is busy or not answering the call will be forwarded to the
voicemail service.  Rates are about US $4,00 a month. For listening to
your messages one will be charged a local call. If the experiment is
successful the new service will be offered nation wide somewhere in
the beginning of 1996. Just like the voice mail service, call waiting
is also being tested in some towns, and expected to be nation wide in
1996 or 1997.

PTT Telecom also announced that caller ID is going to be available to
customers in the near future. Yet, myself I am doubting if this is all
going to happen this fast, since it is considered an invasion of privacy, 
and some consumer unions have objections against it.

And to end this message, the second GSM network called MT-2 changed it's
name to Libertel.

Subject: Writing a Network Performance Application
Date: 27 Jun 1995 12:35:51 GMT
Organization: PiX - Proxima information X-change


We are two fourth year Electrical Engineering students who need to write 
an application which will communicate with an Ethernet card to obtain 
the following information online:
size, number and destination addresses of all frames sent on an Ethernet 
LAN, so that we can build an application which measures network 
performance. 

Thus far, a number of approaches have been suggested:

1. Write a Windows application, and write the TCP/IP layers ourselves.
2. Write a Windows application by interfacing with Winsock.
3. Write a DOS application, with assembler code to capture frames and 
place them in a buffer.

ANY help and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

[River Edge, New Jersey]

A major east coast reseller(Unitel/Totaltel)of the WILTEL Network
has developed an aggressive Business Development Plan for agents of
telecommunications services.

The plan is designed to facilitate agent recruitment by allowing you
to offer your agents the same aggressive compensation you receive.
They in turn can offer their agents the same compensation which they
are receiving.  In this manner, you are encouraged to develop an
extensive network of sub-agents and will derive significant overrides
on their sales.  When combined with the substantial commissions you
will receive from direct sales, and even higher Incentive Commis-
sions, your revenues WILL increase.

Following is a basic commission chart. For details, please send 
email to    abc@dorsai.org   or call (718)539-6134
 
It's totally free to be an agent for the first year.

Goodman, in the Preface, inveighs against the sensational, incomplete,
and misleading accounts of the "Information Superhighway" in the
popular media.  Then, in the first paragraph of chapter one, he states
that if you could hear digital signals you would somehow have an
understanding of this coming technology.  I've often listened to
digital signals.  They sound like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (on
CD-ROM), nothing (the speeds of modern computers render even the hiss
of interference inaudibly above the range of human hearing), or static
(when listening in on modem "conversations").  While it may be fun (my
wife has determined that the negotiation of a V.32bis/V.42bis modem
calling a V.32 modem with LAP-M error correction and non-MNP data
compression exactly reproduces the opening phrase of the song
"Misty"), it doesn't tell you anything about advanced communications
technology, or its impact on society.
 
This book does provide a broad overview of the myriad technologies
which might (no one knows what will) make up the Information
Superhighway.  It is more objective, and less prone to hyperbole and
cant, than others I've reviewed in this general area.
 
Note, however, that it is lacking in analytical rigour, research
(Pareto.  The 80/20 rule is the "Pareto Principle".  You're welcome.),
and even a basic familiarity with the common technologies.  The
Internet is introduced with references to the military and
governmental impetus for the ARPAnet project.  Goodman then goes on to
describe Usenet news, ignoring the fact that news is not, strictly
speaking, an Internet application, and Usenet was never part of any
government plan.  A continued insistence on the lack of a "single"
highway indicates that Goodman has no grasp of the concept of layered
architectures.
 
The jacket blurbs and the accompanying letter I received ("press
materials"?)  promote the book as a layman's guide.  Fair enough.
They would doubtless downplay the technical errors on that basis.
Conceptual mistakes of this depth and scope, however, must seriously
undermine the value of the book as a whole.  You *will* find more here
than in Time or Newsweek.  But not much more.

Subject: Cord Board Still in Use


After reading the many excellent summaries of manual cord boards, I
had to let you know some are still in use. I was recently on a
consulting assignment looking at Telcom D'Haiti. While they have some
12+ PC based toll positions, they still have a live CORD BAORD with six
positions. Half have been used to fix the other three, but those three are
still used with Toll Tickets during peak traffic periods.

It was rather startling since even with many other problems dues to
Haiti's economics, the Telecom D'Haiti has fairly modern network
service. the raved about the DMS-10 reliablility. So, who will start
the rush to go "buy" Haiti's cord boards?

Thanks to the contributors of the history.

I'm not quite sure how they come up with their numbers on the front
cover, but inside there are chapters talking about thirty-nine
packages of software for Windows or Windows NT.  These are, variously,
demo programs, shareware and freeware.  The book chapters appear, for
the most part, to be portions of the documentation for the programs.
 
The printed material is not always clear about what the packages are,
and what they contain.  Do the Spry, Distinct and Frontier samplers
come with SLIP software?  What does "X-ray" actually do?  Is "Sticky"
just another form of email?
 
Installation instructions are also problematic.  The Trumpet WinSock
seems to have SLIP capabilities, but the text keeps referring to
network cards and drivers.  This is particularly tragic, since almost
all of the other programs require WinSock.
 
The introduction states that the printed material should help you
evaluate which packages to try.  In some cases, the detailed
documentation provides a good overview, but, in many cases, you won't
know much more after reading a chapter than when you began.
 
Since all of these packages appear to require a direct Internet
connection, either dial-up IP or a dedicated network link, it could be
argued that installation instructions are not needed, since you will
be able to call on the services of your Internet provider's customer
support, or the network support within your company.  In that case,
however, the bulk of the material available here will already be
accessible online.

Subject: Maryland Will Add Two New Area Codes


WMAL-AM 630 had two reports about Area codes during their drive-time
show around 9:15am this morning.  The first was about the new 888 area
code for toll free calls, which was sent earlier.

The second report stated that there are (as yet unnumbered) two
additional area codes to be added to 301 and 410 in the State of
Maryland.  The report did not indicate if they would be used to split
either or both area codes (my guess is that they want to change the
numbers to make only numbers local to the Washington Metro area stay
in 301, and move everyone else out of 301 to another area code, and
maybe put Baltimore and local area in its own area code, and leave the
rest either in 410 or give Baltimore the new area code.

Considering that the State Capital in Annapolis acts like the only 
purpose of the Freestate's legislature is to pump money out of Montgomery 
County (where I live) and the rest of the state to subsidize the City of 
Baltimore, giving it its own brand new area code probably makes more 
sense, on the other hand, leaving it with the 410 area code and moving 
everyone outside of Baltimore to a new one is probably more appropriate 
to the favoritism the state has shown to that city!

Further details on this important and life-critical change :) to this 
state's telephone area code system were not disclosed in the report.

The host of the show noted that it seemed wasteful when a company had
stationery made and their area code changes.  It was not pointed out
that usually six months to a year notice is given before the voluntary
change-over period takes place, for which that is usually provided a
six month minimum "grace period" before mandatory use takes effect.  I
think from the first announcement of 410 until it became mandatory was
two years.

So unless a company is in the habit of ordering three- and four-year
supplies of letterheads, (which considering that even a small business can
afford a computer with laser printer, or even a color inkjet if their
letterhead is in color), it seems silly to raise that as an issue.

Date: Wed, 5 Jul 1995 17:40:09 MST
Organization: Primenet


Rural telephone coops can make a major difference in the life of the
rural communities if they emulate the good work of the RAIN group and
its membership like Mid-Central Telephone,Green Hills,etc.  Nearly
8,000 sq miles of rural northern Missouri is now covered by RAIN with
affordable dialups. Here I am living 12 miles from a town of 886 and I
have a dialup -- all I can say is thanks to telephone coops. If our
country is to get 'wired' it is going to be through the efforts of big
and small companies to do it ... anyway thought you folks, who are in
the trenches, would find this of interest.

        ***********************************************

For those who happen to be in the north central portion of Missouri,
Green Hills Telephone Company has installed dialups for shell accounts
in Chillicothe and Ludlow, Missouri.  For information call 800-675-1440
instate or 816-644-2000. (Jim Simon is the President of Green Hills
Telephone and could give folks information on this if needed.)

This rural telephone coop is enabling people like me, who lives out in
rural Missouri, to have affordable internet.  There is a meeting
tonite at the Chillicothe Missouri Library at 7 p.m. to kick off
selling of accounts.

Subject: AUDIO-NETWORKS and AUDIOTEX Mailing Lists


Greetings.  This is a reminder regarding two mailing lists of
potential interest to TELECOM readers:

--- AUDIO-NETWORKS ---

The AUDIO-NETWORKS mailing list is a global Internet discussion forum
for topic areas relating to the digital transmission of audio.  This
includes the range of systems useful for production, broadcast,
studio, and other environments.  The list's emphasis is on the
professional use of these systems.

Suggested areas for discussion include CODECs (and their various
compression techniques), ISDN/Switched 56 (as they relate to digital
audio transmission), deployed and planned digital audio networks
(private, public, domestic, and global), and related systems and
technologies.  Operational hints, experiences, suggestions, and
questions are invited.

For more details, please send the text:

  information audio-networks

as the first text in the body of a message to:

  audio-networks-request@vortex.com


--- AUDIOTEX ---

The AUDIOTEX mailing list is a global Internet discussion forum for
topic areas relating to the field of "audiotex" systems.  "Audiotex"
is a general term covering the broad area of telephone-based information 
systems of a wide variety of types.  The distinguishing characteristic
of an audiotex system is usually the use of either recorded or synthesized 
voice to output information to the user, with either telephone touch-tone 
keys or in some cases voice recognition systems being used for input.
Voicemail systems, information collection/retrieval systems, and entertain-
ment services are all examples of audiotex applications.

[lots of stuff about how big business is worried about little people
frittering away their 1-800 numbers...]

Frankly this attitude apalls me; firstly, phone numbers are leased, not
bought.

Secondly, since 1-800 is *always* dialed with a prefix, why can't leading
0 or 1 be used too?  That gets you an extra two million numbers.

Thirdly, since everyone else has to put up with `area code splits', what is
so different about 800?

A post box number seems the most reasonable analogue of a phone number -- 
it is a random number assigned as an address to receive a rented
service.  If you ask and are patient (or lucky) you might get "Box 1".
However, if the post office is fully subscribed or later gets closed,
or if you have to move to another town, then you're out of luck.

Or an X-rated video store might get 1-888-VID-BARE ?  Could AmEx object to
this?  This "branding" of phone numbers seems like so much snake oil from
this distance.  And the problem seems self-inflicted by the use of mnemonic
numbers to start with.

> the FCC may solve that by just eliminating these popular numbers from 888.

The obvious answer to this and related number-exhaustion problems is
to make new numbers longer than the old ones; this had two advantages:
(1) old numbers won't complete when dialed with the new prefices, and
(2) there are *lots* more new numbers.

Maybe you should just convince Utah, Vermont, Hawaii et al to vacate 180X,
so you could have all of 180-NXXX-XXXX for free-dialing numbers?  :-)
More seriously, what about 188-NXXX-XXXX, or even 18-NXX-XXX-XXX? Then there
can't be a problem, because 188 or 18 + 7 digits just won't complete...
This will work as long as you *don't* advertise 1888.

No country code (favourite pet hate...)  Or maybe Ms Oppenheimer's in Morocco ?

Then the TELECOM Digest Editor noted:

> FCC to eliminate ... 800 numbers from duplication on 888, and also on 011-800

Well, chance would be a fine thing.  Last time I checked, +800 was going to
have EIGHT digit numbers; as above, the duplication problem just disappears,
because +800-XXXX-XXX_ won't complete.

It seems the people who have created mnemonic phone numbers are now being
hoist by their own petard, and have the gaul to complain about it!

Footnote:

    Any time I see a company advertising a phone "number" that consist of
    letters like (for example) "THE-CARD", I (like people in many countries)
    give it a miss because it is too much trouble to try and figure out what
    the digits are supposed to be.

    We've heard previously the arguments about "7 digits" being a natural
    size number for humans to memorize, and I'm not convinced.  In all
    likelyhood, the true "natural length" is probably about three or four 
    digits, and longer numbers are memorized sequences of shorter chunks; 
    why else would you need punctuation?  And ask people in say, Tokyo or 
    France, whether they regard eight digits as "normal" ...

with eight digit numbers, next thing you know they are going to be wanting
ten digit numbers and trying to tell us those are the 'natural length' to

Subject: Dial 1-888 For Toll-Free - First Report


WMAL-AM 630 had two reports about Area codes during their drive-time
show around 9:15am this morning.  The second will come later.
 
This is the first media report where I've heard the major media
mention the upcoming implementation of the 888 area code (one of the
two hosts incorrectly referred to it as a 'prefix'), as an additional
number space for toll-free calls.
 
One of the points made was that some businesses are concerned that
people will not realize that this is also a toll-free area code same
as 800.
 
One of the hosts made the most reasonable solution right off the top
of his head, he said "Why don't they just have a national advertising
campaign, like they do for any other new product, something like
'888=800'."
 
I thought that that was a good idea.
 
And now, my own comments.  It hit me, that that's an excellent
solution.  In fact, you could make it very memorable by doing that.
For a few months, some combination of long distance companies fund a
trade organization, which runs newspaper ads, radio spots and TV ads
that do that.
 
Short ads in newspapers, start small and work up, that say, 'Coming
Soon: 888'.  That's all.  Eventually they work up to full page ads
that say the same thing.  The idea is that they saturate the media
with some silly message like that, which makes almost everyone go nuts
trying to figure out what it's supposed to mean.  Nobody spends good
money to put out a message unless they want people to notice, and this
will be something people don't know what it means.  Repetition is what
counts.
 
Or perhaps make it look like a movie ad for some high-tech movie
similar to those fake ads by Energizer Battery Company.  Perhaps show
films or pictures of high-tech communications equipment over
telephones being used.  Perhaps people putting jumpers on 25-pair
blocks in a telephone company switch rooms, etc., something ala
"Sneakers."
 
"Who knows what will happen to America when 888=800.  Coming this
winter." (or whenever the new area code is to be opened to traffic).
Show fake credits for the movie, e.g. 888 Films Presents 888=800
starring blah, blah, blah.  Perhaps use famous actors in ten second
spots, in the last commercial in the series, all saying the same
thing, and those are the ones listed in the credits for the final ad
or the regular series of ads.
 
Or radio spots.  "Remember 888 is the same as 800.  And it's coming
soon.  It will work the same way."  No indication of what that means.
Piques curiosity that way.
 
Here's an example of one of the highlight ads.  Maybe run this during
the Super Bowl, the way Apple Computer did with its "Runner Carrying
Hammer" spot that only ran once.
 
Someone, expensive business suit, picks up a phone, dials a number
clearly starting with 800, but the rest of the number isn't seen or is
a non-working number (or is a number set up to see how many people
call that number who saw the ad, maybe set up a contest, etc.)  The
person on the screen says, "This isn't United States Salvage and Car
Rental ..." and hangs up, trying again.  Again, same wrong number.
Then someone else starts to use the phone next to them.  Possibly some
guy in a visor cap on backwards, sweat shirt and sweat pants dirty
with oil stains.
 
He walks up to the phone, dials a number and waits, saying "Hello,
U.S. Salvage and Car Rental?  Do you have a part for," and then names
some odd, nonexistent, or unusual part, like "a torsion reciprocator
for a 56 Edsel?  Oh you do, good, can you have it shipped to me next
day overnight?  My account number?  1034-7680.  Yes, that's right, in
blue.  Thanks!"  He turns to leave when our hero who can't make their
call buttonholes him.
 
It may be that they use a woman to ask the guy who just walked up,
might look like the stereotypical 'scatterbrain' who can't remember
things, gives some comic humor.
 
She has a piece of paper in her hand, and an expensive-looking steel
pen.  "Excuse me, I've been trying to get them for hours, every time I
stop I try calling them I get some mortuary.  I can't seem to get
their 800 number from information."
 
Guy has a look on his face.  "Ohhhh.  It's not an 800 number, 
it's 888 ..."
 
"Oh, wait, let me write the number down."  She points her pen at the
paper, and the man looks over.
 
"You have the right number, the area code is 888, not 800."
 
"Excuse me, I thought it was a toll free number.  I'd better get my
calling card, and..."
 
"It is toll free, you won't need your calling card.  The phone
companies had to add a new area code 888, because they ran out of 800
numbers.  It's still toll free, and it still works the same way as an
800 number, you just dial 888 instead of 800 when someone has an 888
number."
 
"Are they changing the 800 number system?"
 
"No, it's an extra area code.  I said they ran out of numbers in 800,
they needed more of them.  A new 888 number won't be the same as an
800 number, and the two have nothing to do with each other.  As you
noticed, the same number in 800 doesn't belong to U.S. Salvage and Car
Rental, it belongs to Quick and Dead Drive-Thru Mortuary and Toxic
Waste Dump in New Jersey."  (Unsubtle reference there.) "Try calling
that number, but use 800 instead of 888."
 
She does.  Show of relief.  "Oh, good, I got the right number.  I need
to rent a 1966 Mustang for a week on Thursday.  I need to impress a
prospect who loves the old 'Pony Cars'.  Oh good, you have one
available?"  (Smile that lights up the sky for miles.) " Wow!  That's
an even better rate than I expected ..."  She continues talking as the
camera pulls back.  The man either leaves, or looks over at her, and
she smiles.  Something silly, perhaps.
  
(Logo below, "888=800.  Remember that...")  

Voice Over: So remember, 888 is also a toll-free area code.  Just
remember, 888=800, both area codes are toll free.  But also remember,
a number in area code 888 is not the same as one in area code 800, but
they both are toll free.  Use 888 the same way as you'd use a call to
800.
 
A message to you from America's Long Distance Companies (and here it
can list all the sponsors, etc.)
 
Or do something like the 'Taster's Choice' commercial series where
something like the above, but the guy and girl become interested in
each other, etc.  Or something else, main thing is to be unusual to
get attention, and to build interest in the ads.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Paul, you are a genius! Your idea makes
marvelous sense to me. I hope the 'people in charge of things' at the
long distance carriers, the ITU and others involved see your message and
decide to try your suggestion. And if they do, they had better give you
credit for it!  Perhaps Ms. Oppenheimer has something to add to this.
Judith, how do you think 'Corporate America' would feel about a massive
advertising campaign such as Paul has suggested?   PAT]
