%T   "CDMA: Principles of Spread Spectrum Communication"
 
The use of a "spread spectrum", or multiple frequencies, for
communication is known in some frequency-division multiplexed local
area networks, and in some proprietary high-speed modems.  Its use in
wireless communications has historically been limited to the military,
where the reliability and security in hostile environments have been
worth the additional engineering.  With the increasing use of, and
interest in, mobile and cellular communications, code- division
multiple access (CDMA) technology is quite desirable.  As well as
security, it offers much greater efficiencies of available bandwidth,
location and velocity information, and improved "hand off" performance
when crossing cell boundaries.
 
Intended as a text for a graduate course in electrical engineering or
communications, the book covers advanced topics in frequency reuse and
bandwidth, synchronization, power considerations, interleaving and
other topics.  (Students are advised to keep texts from earlier
courses as Viterbi does not always define terms or acronyms, and there
are errors in the index.)  While principles are outlined, the bulk of
the book is devoted to detailed calculations of the practicalities of
CDMA design.  Chapter six is specifically devoted to the design of
digital cellular systems.

I had almost a mirror image experience to yours on my residence line
about the time our local central office cut over to ESS in the early
'80s. I suddenly *stopped* getting long distance charges altogether.

Calls to numbers within my home NPA (201) got billed as usual, but
anything with a foreign area code simply didn't show up on my bill.
(This was before the "breakup," so everything was normally billed by
New Jersey Bell regardless of destination. Still, something
"different" about long-distance billing was clearly in place already.)

I suspected something went wrong in the reprogramming of the new
central office, but I didn't call NJB, since I was curious to see how
long it would take for them to discover it on their own. I was careful
to put aside the "savings" on the phone bill each month, since I was
certain the day would come when they discovered the error and demanded
payment. As the months dragged on, I found myself paying a little less
attention to how long I stayed on the phone, or how many times I
dialed an out-of-town BBS, but I didn't go nuts.

Still, it was a full year before I got a "that call" at work from my
wife. She said a nice lady from the phone company had called and
started off the conversation with "Are you sitting down?" (always a
bad sign) and had left a number. I called.

It wasn't all that bad. My LD bill had run up to a tad over 700 bucks.
I tried to sound surprised, but I don't know how well I did. It turns
out, says the "nice lady," that when they reprogrammed the CO, my
telephone number (let's say NNX-6147, was erroneously programmed to
appear on the bill of a local business who had seven trunks beginning
with 6140. Somebody added in their head and forgot to start counting
with zero, it seems. She couldn't explain why my short-distance calls
weren't affected. Anyway, the business hadn't noticed anything odd for
a year, but finally questioned the numbers they were seeing, and got
the phone company to discover their snafu and issue them a credit.

I asked for and received a full listing of the calls, and sure enough
they seemed to be familiar for the most part, but I figured it
couldn't hurt to try and cut a deal with Telco. I called them and said
that even though I couldn't remember every call I'd made for the past
year, let's assume for the sake of argument that all the calls were
mine. Did they expect me to just write them a check for 700 dollars?

No, no, said the "nice lady." Since the billing error was their
mistake, they were prepared to accept a small amount each month. How
much? Oh, say, five or ten bucks tacked on to each bill. So we're
talking about six to twelve years before they would recover the full
amount, right? Um, yeah, she guessed that was right.

Well, if she'd accept fifty cents on the dollar, I offered, I'd write
her a check the next day, and we'd call it even, and what did she
think about that?  Well, she wasn't prepared to do the math in her
head, but she was clearly familiar with the concept of Net Present
Value, which rather precisely calculates what a bird in the hand is
worth, in terms of birds in the bush, at a given interest rate (which
back then would have been double digit). Uh, could she call me back in
fifteen minutes? Sure.

Three minutes later, the phone rang. She had talked to her supervisor,
she said. And?  And, just to confirm, I *had* said the $350 would be
in the mail *tomorrow* right?  Yup -- first thing in the morning, I
assured her.

"Done," she says. "Let me give you a post office box number to mail it
to."

And I haven't seen a billing error since.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: About 1976 I had a case similar to that.
I was living in a building which had a switchboard for the tenants at
the front desk and I decided to get my own personal phone installed as
well. They put in my phone but never sent me a bill for anything, period,
for about one year. Apparently plant never sent the paperwork to the
accounting department saying the installation was complete. Since in those
days we had a category of service where you got unlimited local calling
(which is what I had ordered), provided there were no coin-rated calls on
the bill (which I was careful to avoid) there was never any reason for
anything to hit the accounting department out of the ordinary. Then one
day some #$&^# phreak somewhere made a phraud thirty-party call and billed
it to my number. Hmmm ... well of course the charges were forwarded to
Illinois Bell from whatever telco was involved (or maybe it was intra-
LATA all via Illinois Bell, I don't remember) and the end result was when
the charges got into the system they 'fell out' for lack of an account to
bill them to. Unbillable charges go into a suspense account and there are
clerks whose job it is to be constantly cleaning out the suspense ledger
and moving the charges to where they belong. This can be done by charging
it back to the telco from which it originated, or by trying to investigate
locally, etc. 

As part of the investigative process, if it is just a couple dollars or less
then the clerks usually write it off on the assumption it costs more to
do the paperwork charging it back to the other telco and arguing with the
other telco about it ("you sent it to us"; "no we didn't, you must have
gotten it from another telco"). And sometimes for whatever reason in those
days the paperwork would get so mutilated and banged up they did not know
where they got the charge from so they had to write it off. This time around,
someone decided to dial the number and see if it was actually in service
or not. Of course it rang; of course I answered. Bingo, that set off an
audit with accounting making an inquiry of plant to see what the actual
status of the line was. Plant reconstructed what paperwork they had on
it and accounting had to turn on the service after the fact. 

Like yourself, I had been putting aside money for that day, and one day
here comes a bill in the mail for installation charges and monthly service
for about *one year* to date. Like yourself, I made a fuss about it, but
not a very loud one. I mean, I knew what I was doing all along, so I
had no legitimate gripe. I could have inquired about it a year before I
did. They did however take off the phraud call which had been billed to
me, and the supervisor got a big laugh out of the way things had all
come together.   PAT]

Subject: Convert DID Voice System to ISDN BRI Voice System
Date: 21 Aug 1995 23:41:52 GMT
Organization: InfoTime


Could someone please help me find a solution to this problem:

I need to replace DID circuits with ISDN BRI.

Here's how my current system works:

There are several DID trunks connected to an Exacom DID SF-200
interface box, which is connected to a Dialogic voice card on a voice
mail system.  There are 140 phone numbers assigned to the DID trunks.
When a call comes in, the Exacom box signals the voice card and passes
the last 4 digits of the phone number to the voice card.  The voice
mail system then answers, looks up the 4 digit number and then plays
the associated greeting.

The main problem is that DID circuits are very expensive in my area
(the other, less important for now, issues include that DID is inbound
only, and I feel that ISDN would be a better technology for the
future).

ISDN can provide the same functionality for 1/3 the monthly cost.

Here's what I want:

I want an ISDN device that will accept an ISDN line on one end and
provide two analog phone lines on the other.  The analog lines should
be able to signal my voice card in the same way that the Exacom box
does (in band DTMF).  (If that is not possible I may be able to take
the signalling info from a D channel via (maybe) a serial interface,
that would provide the info out of band.  But the former is MUCH
preferred).

Exacom said they were going to make a product like this in the future,
the rep called it an ISDN to loop converter with DTMF.  They did not
provide a time-table, so I suspect it would be at least a year or more
 -- so I don't want to wait for them.

If there's not an off-the-shelf product for this, I'd be interested in any
tips on how I could build one myself.

BTW, I've contacted all the vendors I could think of, and nobody seems to
have anything remotely close.  There were a lot of PRI devices, but not
BRI.

Can anyone recommend any products, vendors, etc that may be able to help
me convert from DID to ISDN?  Any and all advice is welcomed and REALLY
appreciated.

                   ADAPTIVE SIGNAL PROCESSING
                      IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS

Adaptive signal processing algorithms are central to network echo
cancellation, speech enhancement and acoustic echo cancellation (for
hands-free teleconferencing and wireless communications), channel
equalization, interference rejection in CDMA cellular, smart antennas,
and active noise control.  The course will give an overview of the
Least Means Squares (LMS) and Recursive Least Squares (RLS) adaptive
filter algorithms. It will focus on how these algorithms are used in
the above telecommunications applications.  September 11-12, 1995;
8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.; UTD Conference Center; Instructor, Eric
Dowling, Ph.D.; fee - $595, CEU's 1.4; for additional information,

                MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING

In the past decade, the mobile communications industry has enjoyed an
exponential growth in its customer base.  This has forced many
industries to respond to the demands of this exciting field.  This
course introduces engineers and other professionals to the basic
elements of mobile communications engineering.  Principle, practice,
and system overview of mobile systems will be discussed.  The main
objective of this two-day course is not to provide an in-depth
coverage of all the elements of this field, but to focus on the key
elements, such as cell geometry, cochannel interference, modulation
schemes, and channel effects.  The key elements of TDMA and CDMA
emerging digital cellular systems will be introduced.  Subsequently, a
comparison of these emerging systems in the face of channel
impairments will be discussed in terms of the performance measures
introduced in this course.  September 15-16, 1995; 8:30 a.m. - 4:30
p.m.; UTD Conference Center; Instructor, Kamran, Kiasaleh, Ph.D.; fee
- $595; CEU's 1.4; for additional information, call Barbara Johnson at

               OBJECT-ORIENTED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

Object-Oriented Programming has become the methodology of choice in
the 1990's.  This course aims to equip students with knowledge of the
principles of sound analysis and design techniques for programs that
will be implemented in C++ or Smalltalk.  Students will learn by
experience as designs are formulated through the use of several case
studies.  The chosen methodology will mainly be based on Rumbaugh's
OMT, although brief overviews of FUSION and Booch's methodology will
also be given.  September 21-22, 1995; 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.; UTD
Conference Center; Instructor, Ivor Page, Ph.D.; fee - $595; CEU's
1.4; for additional informa- tion, call Barbara Johnson at (214)
883-2204.

                         VIDEO DIAL TONE

Video-based services, such as Video Dial Tone (VDT), are witness- ing
rapid growth.  This growth is likely to accelerate as some of the
regulatory barriers faced by cable companies, local exchange carriers
and interexchange carriers are removed by the Congress.  In order to
meet the higher bandwidth requirements of the video signals, telephone
and cable companies are introducing new transport and switching
technologies in the network.  The stan- dards organizations such as
ITU-TS and committee T1 and the ATM Forum are also defining new
standards for handling video servic- es.  This course is designed to
bring students up-to-date with the market dynamics of the video
industry and to provide techni- cal details, from data storage to
different delivery architec- tures for the VDT services.  September
25-26, 1995; 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.; UTD Conference Center; Instructor,
Sudhir Gupta; fee - $595; CEU's 1.4; for additional information, call
Barbara Johnson at (214) 883-2204.

              DESIGN OF FIBER COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

The design of high data rate/bandwidth short haul and long haul fiber
communications systems is becoming important because of the high
demand for large data rate/bandwidth transmission.  Efforts are on the
way to seamlessly connect the cellular networks to fiber networks
whereby more services can be offered. This course introduces
engineers, scientists and managers working in the telecommunications
industries to the basic elements of fiber communication.  Principle,
design, practice and system overview of analog and digital fiber
communication will be discussed.  After completing the two-day course,
the participants will have enough knowledge to understand, design as
well as to evaluate digital and analog fiber systems.  Design of
10Gbits/s digital systems, fiber communication for video transmission,
wavelength division multiplexed systems, systems with concatenated
fiber amplifiers, dispersion compensators and external modulators are
some of the topics that will be discussed.  The data rate impair-
ments due to nonlinearity and methods to combat them will also be
discussed.  October 17-18, 1995; 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.; UTD Conference
Center; Instructor, Lakshman Tamil, Ph.D., fee - $595; CEU's 1.4; for
additional information, call Barbara Johnson at (214) 883-2204.

Subject: New Newsletter on 800, 900 Numbers:  inTELigence


Newsletter Separates Fact From Fiction For Users Of 800, 900 Telephone
Services
  
New York, NY -- The alleged exhaustion of available 800 telephone numbers 
and proposed new rules on how the system is to be administrated has spawned 
a newsletter to keep users of 800 and 900 exchanges up-to-date.
  
inTELigence, published by Interactive CallBrand, tracks actions being
considered by the rule-making bodies involved as well as proposals from the
telephone service providers.    
  
"We separate fact from rumor," said Judith Oppenheimer, president of
Interactive CallBrand. "The newsletter tracks the regulators and the
service providers and compares their claims with what's actually going on
in the marketplace. That way we can advise users about what proposals they
may want to make to the rule-making bodies."    
  
Several months ago regulators became concerned about the dwindling supply
of 800 numbers and they predicted the current supply could be exhausted by
February, 1996. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other
bodies are reviewing how to allocate the current supply of numbers and is
overseeing the addition of a new 888 toll-free exchange which is supposed
to be ready for use in March, 1996.   
    
"The next few months will be critical and proposed rules will be changing
from week to week. Our clients needed some way to keep up and that's why we
started inTELigence," Oppenheimer said.    
  
Interactive CallBrand and its clients are concerned that doubling the
toll-free database will cause quality of service to be compromised. A
decline in service could mean slower phone service for customers who have
come to depend upon the 800 and 900 systems.    
  
inTELigence will also be monitoring plans by service providers to educate
the public about the new 888 service and changes in the telephone system
that may be needed to accommodate it.    
  
These issues are critically important not only to the technical people who
will have to implement the new system, but also to marketers who need 800
and 900 services for customer sales and who want access to the new 888
exchange.

Reply-To: fritz@mirage.hc.ti.com


There is an extremely interesting document available at:

http://www.open.gov.uk/oftel/oftelwww/oftcons.htm

which explains how the UK intends to handle the area-code and number
shortage problems, in a very flexible and user-friendly way.  Makes me
wonder why we couldn't do it the same way (I know, North America is a
lot bigger and has more people, but the scheme is scaleable).  It also
(horrors!) asks for *feedback* and *comments* on the various
proposals.

But we know it would never work here -- the opening statement is:

"*TELEPHONE NUMBERS BELONG* to people and businesses and they need to be
treated as a national resource. OFTEL took over responsibility for the
UK Numbering Scheme from BT in 1994. This means that OFTEL now makes
plans for the future use of numbers and allocates numbers to telephone
companies to allow them to provide service to their customers.  To help
us make the right decisions, we are committed to consulting all those
with an interest - residential customers, business users and the
telecommunications industry."

(Emphasis mine.)

And other heresies like:

"When you call a person with the same area code, you usually dial only
their local number -- this is known as local dialing.  But you can dial
the full national number if you prefer. Your call will be connected and
the charge is the same either way."

Of course.  And I repeat:  11D (or 10D) dialing for such calls seems

      I believe there is another reason for this, Pat.  The leading
"1" identifies the call as a call for which a charge is made.

      In Southwestern Bell territory, at least, originally the leading
"1" was not required.  A great many calls to the business office were
generated by people making 7D calls to numbers which were interzone or
toll.  They had no indication that the calls were chargeable.

      It eventually became apparent that a large number of customers
were not comfortable with the fact they could not tell from the way
they had to dial the call whether the call was toll or not.  (Note
that virtually all service in Southwestern Bell territory was, and is,
flat rate.)

      So the driving force in adopting "1+" in Southwestern Bell
territory, at least, was the demand from customers and the number
of calls that had to be written off.

      Those in this newsgroup tend to feel that everyone is, or should
be, as knowledgable as they are about communications matters.  The
great majority of customers are not, and furthermore they don't want
to be and don't see why they should be forced to be.  And in the long
run they will vote if that's what is required to make telephone
service convenient for them.  It is, perhaps, one of the penalties
that has to be paid for the telephone's becoming such an integrated
part of the fabric of life in the U.S.A. that the great body of the
public thinks it is theirs and should be operated for their benefit.

      Even in a corporate environment, it is very hard to educate the
users about how to use the telephone service.  Most of them don't
know; they may learn how to use a few features that are advantageous
to them.  I have been a part of such education efforts.

      There are some cases where this is true, but they tend to be
special situations.  One of the most notable cases is the Kansas City
metropolitan area (certainly not a rural area) where cross-NPA and
cross-state line (they are the same thing there) are indeed 7D for
local calls.

      But this is limited to calls within the Kansas City metropolitan
exchange.  If you call outside the flat rate area, you have to use
1 + NPA + 7D.

      Note that when cross-NPA 7D dialing is used, the NXX has to be
"protected" in the other NPA.  So the number of available NXXs is
reduced by the number of NNXs that can be dialed 7D across the
boundary.

      So I imagine the days of that arrangement in metropolitan
Kansas City are numbered.

      In the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, that time has
already arrived.  Local calls in the same area code are dialed as 7D.
Local calls across the NPA boundary are dialed as AC+7D (10 digits).
Chargeable calls to any point, whether within the same area code or
not, are dialed as 1+AC+7D (11 digits).

JEB> dialing to all exchanges within the community, and 11 digit dialing to

      Since in cities of any size the percentage of intra-wire center
calls is quite low, this wouldn't be of any great benefit.  And wire
center boundaries don't usually follow "residential area" or
"community" boundaries anyway.

JEB> worse.  (See previous messages about stationary and advertising costs

      Since almost all "areas" (wire center areas? metropolitan
exchanges? what kind of area?) are a mix of residential and business,
and served from the same COs, it's hard to see how, or why, this
distinction could be made or implemented.

      As to stationary and advertising costs, these occur whenever a
wire center boundary is changed, when a business relocates or gets a
centrex or other types of inward dialing arrangements.

      And if the business expects to ever get a call from outside its
own narrow area, it's going to need to show its area code anyway.

      Most businesses are fairly small, with a few lines at most (many
have only one).  But unless it's the local barber shop, most of them
expect someone will call them long distance at some time and will want
to show their area code anyway.  (Even the local barber shop may
expect to get calls from vendors outside the local area, and not just
unsolicited sales calls, either; businesses need vendors to supply
their needs.)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Wait a minute. We went through this several
years ago here about the meaning and purpose of 'one'. The One True Religion
says that 'one' indicates the three digits following consitute an area code.
I had thought that all those heretics who kept insisting that 'one' meant
'the call you are now dialing has a toll charge involved' had long since
been excommunicated from this Digest and that those who then persisted in
their heresy had been beheaded. <g> ... Now here you are back to pester me
again!  ...

Even if we assume there is some validity in the 'one = toll' argument --
and it probably was valid a number of years ago when area codes did not
change with every street corner and back yard neighbor's fence -- there is
not a lot of consistency there now. One does not equal toll for large
segments of customers in 312/708 who are near each other. There are many
many cases now where inter-areacode dialing is purely local. I'll grant
you in more rural and lesser populated areas of the USA -- let us take
Wyoming, or Montana as examples -- you still have to go the entire state
before you change area codes and toll generated from seven digit dialing 
is pretty common. But do they dial 1 plus seven digits in that case, in
order to catch the attention of the originator of the call?  I would think
they would do that if alerting the caller to the existence of toll was
the reason for the leading one.   PAT]

In *most* area where you may dial local across an NPA boundry you dial
7D.  'The rule' in *most* rural areas is 'if it is local, it is 7D'
regardless of NPA.  The exception is in *metropolitan* areas where you
dial 10D or 11D to cross NPAs.

Check the boundry lines between NPAs in 'rural' areas, such as the=20
Michigan/Indiana border, where South Bend, IN, can call Niles, MI, and
Elkhart, IN, can call Union and Edwardsburg, MI.

Along every NPA border there are several rural communities who can dial
across the line 7D.

Look at Indiana ---

 317-564 Delphi to 219-652 Burrows / 219-686 Camden / 219-859 Deer Creek /
                   219-943 Idaville / 219-965 Yeoman (and back);

 317-981 LaFontaine to 219-563/568/569 Wabash (and back);

 317-964 Union City to 513-968 Union City, OH (as expected);

 317-732 West College Corner to 513-523/529/798 College Corner, OH
                            and 513-796 Morning Sun, OH;

ALL of these offer 7D local across NPA borders.

The only 1+ NPA requirement I have seen in all of Indiana is from East
Chicago, Hammond, and Whiting, Indiana who can call Calumet City, Illinois,
locally by dialing 1+708.

Where there is a cross NPA local call in rural areas you are *most likely*
to find 7D dialing.  The exception is 10D or 11D.  Inter-NPA 7D dialing is
the rule, especially in rural areas.

All NEW services in the overlay, regardless of use.  Most would be
cellular/ paging/PBX uses since that is where most of the growth is.
1+NPA would always be allowed and suggested as the 'norm' with 7D
being allowed for local calls (all exchanges at your CO plus a few
close neighbors).

Nobody should ever have to change their phone number unless they move.
That would include wireless services.  Every time a cell operator has
to move their NXX from one NPA to another they must get every customer
to bring in their phone to change the MIN.  The same NXX cannot be
used in the old NPA for cell service untill all the changes are made.
Paging companies are easier to move since DID to their switches need
not contain the NPA.

As far as cellular in Chicago goes, there are a few NXX conflicts that
prevent moving all cellular in 708 and 312 directly to a new NPA
without changing a few NXX's.  But the majority of NXX's in use for
cellular are not duplicated in the other Chicago NPAs.

It would be nice not to ever change your NPA.  But that is part of
progress.  Have you noticed how many CO names changed when DDD was
introduced?  The recent discussions of Seattle, New Orleans and
Chicago exchange histories show a few of these.  Based on 1940's
estimates the exaustion of NPAs in 1994 was right on target.

The original plan was 'no resplit within 10 years'.  It is a shame to
see resplits within 5 years but that is part of the change in technology.
Overlays would fix this IF all users would accept numbers in the
new area and NO user would be removed from the old area.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It is quite interesting that you mention
the Hammond, Whiting and East Chicago area of northern Indiana in your
article. I remember when those all dialed 7-D to reach anywhere in 312.
Hammond's exchanges WEstmore-1, 2, and 3 along with TIlden 4 and 5,
plus East Chicago's EXport-7 and 8 had to be dialed 219 + 7D from the
Chicago side however. Note, it was not 1 + 219 + 7D since we did not dial
a leading '1' here until about 1980 or so. Even when Chicago had to
dial 219+7D to reach northern Indiana (but not the same way in reverse)
for a few years thereafter Calumet City could still dial 7-D to get
Hammond/Whiting. Of course this meant that the prefixes 397,398,659,
844,845,931,932,933 could not be assigned in the 312 area. 

A similar case existed in Antioch, Illinois and North Antioch, Wisconsin
where 312-395 could dial 414-396 as seven digits and vice-versa. This
did not however prevent the use of 396 elsewhere in northern Illinois;
the rule was that subscribers in Antioch had to dial 1+ to reach anywhere
in northern Illinois *other than their immediate local area*. I think at
one point they asked for community input on the decision and everyone
decided they would prefer to be able to call the Wisconsin side of their
community with seven digits (instead of ten or eleven) even it if meant
having to dial eight digits (1+7D) for everywhere else in the same area
code. That was a long, long time before the 312/708 split of course.  PAT]

There is another one in place and operating right now -- 281 here in
Houston, and 972 will be overlaid on 214 (i.e., Dallas) six months
from now.

Indeed, 10D is in its permissive period right now here in 713 (but
*not* in the 281 overlay -- any calls made from or to that NPA _must_
be dialed 10D now), and next March 1 10D will become mandatory on all
local calls within 713.

It's still in place in the Kansas City area as of a month ago, from
personal observation, and in a few border communities in South Dakota
(also as of a month ago, from the same personal observation), but in
my travels across sixteen states last month, those are the only places
I found it.

It refers only to LOCAL calls to other area codes.

Did you mean 562?  It was just announced as a geographical split,
which means a second area code change in less than ten years for some
people who switched from 213 to 310.  And 760 has been announced for
split of 619.

The outer Stockholm suburbs have had eight digit numbers for several
years.  Those are the old 07xx-xxx xx numbers that were merged with 08
between 1991 (?) and 1993.  Those numbers then became 08-5xxx xxxx (we
write them 5xx xxx xx).

The government regulatory, Post- & Telestyrelsen (PTS), has decided
that all new Swedish number series are to be 0 plus nine digits but
there is no plan to move all numbers to at least 0 plus eight.  I
guess dominant operator (& former monopoly) Telia isn't going to
change those unless PTS makes them.

I wonder if not the competitors would want numbers that are of
(almost) equivalent length to that of Telia's ...

        A difference is that the Australian area codes don't just
cover the cities mentioned. Each of the new Australian area codes will
cover at least one whole state. I belive Denmark and Norway also have
eight digit codes for wide areas consisting of more than one city.
France excluding Paris is also like this. I _think_ that Paris, Tokyo
and Hong Kong are the only cities that have an area code for the city
that is not shared with anywhere else and which has entirely eight
digits numbers. I think that this is what the original statement
meant, although it is not exactly what it said.  The question as to
what other cities should have an arrangement like this but don't will
largely be left as an exercise to the reader.  (I would argue London,
certainly. It might have made sense for places like New York and Los
Angeles, too, but the US decided long ago to go for a uniform three +
seven digits which rules it out).

  Subject: PATNEWS: TRW versus Inmarsat - patent wars in outer space

   One of the reasons that the professional IP community has been so
apathetic to the problem of software prior art is that for the big
boys, software patent lawsuits are more of a nuisance than anything
else (and even then, when you lose you often can win, if you look at
Microsoft's final arrangements with Stac and Wang).  As big as a
million dollars maybe to the rest of us, in some circles it isn't that
much.

   A billion dollars, well that's big bucks to pretty much everyone,
including two outer space companies, TRW and Inmarsat, amounts
currently at stake over a patent with a very curious history for which
the fat lady has yet to sing.  It's hard to be apathetic to billion
dollar actions.

   Last May, I had sent an IPNS news item on a patent TRW was seeking
dealing with satellite configurations in medium Earth orbit, based on
an article I had seen in the London Financial Times.  TRW had been
suggesting in the space community that it's patent was broad enough to
prohibit anyone else from using medium Earth orbit's for satellite
systems.  While not many of us are trying to do so, one other company
was doing so, Inmarsat.  Both TRW and Inmarsat are spending billions
to establish satellite telephone constellations, big stakes.

   Coincidently, the day after I sent out that news item, the patent
issued, kind of.  The "kind of" was that for awhile that day the
patent was prepared to be issued, and made it to the PTO's patent text
database long enough for me to download the text and mail it out as a
news item, only for the patent to be retracted by the Patent Office
and therefore never formally issued (TRW claimed to know of only two
other such instances in the past 100 years).

   The action puzzled many.  "All I can say is that the Patent Office
told us they wanted more time to review their internal quality control
methods", one TRW spokesman said. "We had expected to receive the
patent certificates on May 16, as scheduled.  It was not until that
date that we were told otherwise".  I quess that it is rare that a
patent gets this far before being pulled.

   "It is our responsibility to not knowingly issue an invalid claim",
said Stephen Kunin, the Patent Office's deputy assistant commissioner
for patent policy and projects.  "If, on internal review, it comes to
our attention that we may have a claim that should not go out, and we
have strong evidence that this is the case, we try to prevent it from
going out. TRW will most certainly be given an opportunity to get the
case ship shape.  They may end up with the claims they thought they
would get.  From our standpoint of administering the law, we want to
be sure we have done the job we are paid to do", Kunin said.

   I suspect Inmarsat must have some good lobbyists and pulled a few
strings [The timing of the above events, with the patent temporarily
issuing, is in conflict with the timing of an internal review catching
the patent in time].  As it should, and should be able to, given that
Inmarsat is investing $2.6 billion in its satellite telephone
constellation system that will compete with TRW's Odyssey.  As TRW was
claiming that their patents would stop Inmarsat from deploying its
satellites, Inmarsat must have done something to get the PTO to
reconsider (though Inmarsat denies doing anything), especially given
skepticism many in the space industry have about satellite orbit
patents in general.  Earlier in the year, TRW had said it would sue
Inmarsat once the patents issued.

   TRW was notified in April that their patents were to be awarded,
and due to TRW press releases, the PTO had been repeatedly contacted
by members of the space industry to find out what was up.  As Olof
Lundberg, CEO of the Inmarsat project stated, "We have always been of
the view that the concept of using intermediate circular orbits in
connection with global mobile satellite communications has been known
for decades and that any patent obtained by TRW for this general
concept would be of questionable validity".

   The rivalry between the two companies is intense. Last June, TRW
petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to deny the
application of Comsat Corp.  for authority to participate in the
purchase of facilities of Inmarsat-P, the proposed private off-shot of
Inmarsat. Comsat is the US signatory to Intelsat.

   Last month, TRW was awarded one patent, 5,433,726.  Interestingly,
the issued patent had 35 claims, while the original version that was
reconsidered had 51 claims.  TRW shortly thereafter warned Inmarsat
that it could be infringing TRW's patent.  According to Bruce Gerding,
TRW vice president and managing director of the company's Odyssey
program, "The broad scope of its coverage poses a major concern for
any aspiring imitators in the field of space-based personal
communications systems.  We believe that any imitator would have
difficulty in launching a commercially viable medium Earth orbit
system without infringing our patent".

   Inmarsat's Lundberg countered, "We are certainly not in the
business of infringing other people's patents.  We cannot believe that
any patent office would issue patents that are so broad that they
cover orbits and the general ability to communicate through
satellites.  Our detailed system design is quite different from our
competitor's."

   According to industry analysts, TRW has the fewest partners and the
least capital and is least likely to get its system off the ground,
and suspect TRW will use the patent offensively to buy time and raise
more resources.  (Other than Inmarsat, TRW also is competing with two
low Earth orbit ventures which all will be targeting the personal
communication systems market).

   Here are some of the details of the patent:

5433726
Medium-earth-altitude satellite-based cellular telecommunications system

ABSTRACT
    A satellite-based cellular telecommunications system employing a
constellation of telecommunications satellites in medium earth orbit to
provide multibeam radio frequency (rf) communications links for worldwide
cellular telephone service with a minimum number of satellites. The
telecommunications satellites are placed in a plurality of inclined orbits
about the earth at an altitude of between approximately 5600 and 10,000
nautical miles. The characteristics of the orbits, such as the number of
orbits, the inclination of each orbit, the number of satellites in each
orbit and the altitude of the satellites, are tailored to maximize the
coverage area of the satellites and their related line-of-sight elevation
angles, while minimizing propagation time delays, the number of
beam-to-beam and satellite-to-satellite handovers, and the total number of
satellites. The present invention also includes several additional
features which essentially eliminate beam-to-beam and
satellite-to-satellite handovers, thus dramatically reducing the
likelihood of dropouts. between the plug and the anchor to prevent the
plug from entering the opening in the vessel.

CLAIM ONE
    A method of providing medium-earth-orbit satellite-based communications
between low-power mobile handsets having an omni-directional antenna and a
gateway station through a satellite forming part of a satellite
constellation, comprising the steps of:

 launching a plurality of satellites to an orbiting altitude between 5600
    and 10,000 nautical miles, wherein at least one satellite has a reduced
    antenna field of view (FOV) less than full earth coverage;

 orienting said satellites in a plurality of orbital planes which are
    inclined at a predetermined inclination angle with respect to the
    equatorial plane of the earth;

 receiving, by at least one of said satellites, radio frequency (RF) signals
    from a plurality of mobile handsets which transmit said RF signals using
    their omni-directional antennas; and

 overlapping a portion of a coverage region of a departing satellite with a
    portion of a coverage region of an arriving satellite, including
    assignment means having a predetermined criterion of assignment that calls
    placed to or from a user located within the coverage overlap region are
    assigned to said arriving satellite.

Interestingly, the prior art cited includes 59 US patents, 8 foreign
patents, and 36 literature references, which is a pretty good amount
compared to most other patents, though no NASA or DoD technical
reports were cited.  I am curious to see what prior art will be dug up
if the patent is ever challenged.

   In the end, all of this will end up in the courts.  Stay tuned, the
fireworks should be great.  As a bit of advice to the PTO, there is a
pending biotech patent that will cause a global morality outroar when
it is issues.  I suggest you crank up the internal reviews, and save
yourself a massive headache.

Subject: New Area Code Test Numbers


US West issued a press release on August 17th that included supposedly
"toll-free" test numbers for reaching new area codes.  These are
generally used by people who are concerned whether their PBX's have
been updated sufficiently to allow calls to new area codes.  I can't
be certain these are toll-free, but calling them gets you what sounds
like a standard intercept.

The video which accompanies this book (little more than an ad for
Internet access -- and "Classroom Connect") states at one point that
the Internet's educational resources are almost uncharted.  This is
true only in comparison to the overexposure that other topics get.
"Educator's Internet Companion" is, too, almost a sampler of other
Wentworth products.  Still, it is worth consideration for some
practical ideas and a quick, easy-to-follow resource guide.
 
The lesson plans of chapter one are quite terse and provide more
suggestions and sites than usable curriculum.  Still, the thirty
outlines do cover a range of topics and activities (albeit they rely
heavily on Gopher, and World Wide Web).  The idea of "guided" tours
through menu-driven systems is odd, but the Internet can be daunting
initially.  The lists of Gopher, telnet, ftp, and WWW sites, as well
as mailing lists and newsgroups, are brief, but to the point and easy
to read.  A discussion of funding sources is limited in specifics to
the United States, but possibly extremely helpful there.  A series of
appendices cover, concisely, Internet concepts and tools, acceptable
use policies, and the major commercial online services.
 
Wentworth seems to be quite serious about the educational market, and their
offerings are practical in both content and prices.

Subject: IntegreTel/VRS Billing-Bulk Block Procedure


Pat,

The accounts payble administrator here has been working very hard to
get through to IntegreTel, Inc. & VRS Billing Systems, Inc. to block
numbers from our campus.  After several weeks, she managed to get a
decent rep who provided the following information via fax:

(My paraphrasing, exact text is denoted by "")

To block 10 numbers or less, call 1-800-BLOCKME (800-256-2563)

[TELECOM Editor's Note: Really, 1-800-4-BLOCKME (800-425-6256, optional 3)
See my note at the end of this file.  PAT]

Larger quantities of numbers, you can send an ASCII text file on
diskette.  The file must be a flag text file, not WordPerfect, Excel,
etc.  Each phone number should be on a separate line, 10 digit number,
followed by carriage return.  No dashes, commas, or blanks.  "If
numbers are within a range, please include the range in a cover
letter".  Enclose a cover letter with: company, organization, or
institution name, address, contact person with phone number in case of
processing errors.

Mail diskette to:
IntegreTel/VRS Billing Systems, Inc.
Consumer Relations Department
PO Box 611987
San Jose CA  95161-1987

Questions should be directed to the 1-800-BLOCKME number.

"Please note: This blocking services if free of charge and normally
takes 10 working days to take effect.  This blocking service takes
advantage of modern blocking technology that should prohibit access
to services, but is not 100% guaranteed and only effective for such
services that are billed by VRS Billing Systems and/or IntegreTel."

Hope all of you find this information helpful!

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I tried it your way and got a sort
of irritated lady who told me it was 4-BLOCK-ME **not** BLOCK-ME.
So I redialed it as suggested and did indeed get through to an
automatic service. I only have a couple of complaints about it
and both are minor. Your ANI is delivered to them at the time you
call, and if you indicate you wish to block your home number, they
respond by blocking the ANI given to them without an opportunity
to block *additional* residence numbers unless apparently you call
them from each line involved, one at time. They offer the choice of
blocking '800 callback services' as well as 'international services'.
A third option is to block 'all services billed by Integratel/VRS'.
They do offer a menu selection for blocking of business phones but
I did not try that one. Perhaps it allows more than one entry per
call. 

To repeat though, as the irritated lady told me -- after apparently
receiving many such calls -- 'the number for those people is eight
digits long': (1-800) 4BLOCK-ME, or 1-800-425-6256. What you do with 
the '3' on the end is up to you, I guess. 

Maybe this could be the start of something new in the USA: Eight digit
numbers, with Integratel boldly providing the leadership and setting
the example for other telco organizations -- even Bellcore!  <grin>  PAT]

I was under the distinct impression that IXCs were permitted to charge
to an 800 caller's line only with a prior written agreement, under a
recent FCC rule.

We went around with this a while ago, with many people pointing out
that often someone who was using a phone to call an 800 number had no
authority to charge anything to that phone line.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It can be a 'verbal agreement' as well,
or an 'agreement' that is implied by some single action on the part of
the caller such as pressing a touchtone button. In fairness to the
folks who run those services, bear in mind that many magazine and mail
order purchases come with forms already addressed in your name with
your only action required being to check a box entitled "YES ... send
me a subscription and bill me later." Those have been upheld as legal,
with the rule being that as long as the respondent is required to take
'some positive action in agreement with the proposal made by the seller'
then the contract is enforceable. If you and I mutually agree that your
pressing a button on the phone and causing the phone to make a noise 
that my computer understands to mean 'yes' will commence the sale or
delivery of my goods or services to you, then I gotcha!  Since voicemail
and the pressing of buttons on phone to communicate requests and
decisions is very common these days, one can hardly claim that the
same principle, when used by Information Providers is somehow too unusual
or different in nature.  Check a box ... press a button ... etc.   

The other thing the IP's successfully claimed was that in 'regular
telephone calls' the operator is allowed to accept your verbal
approval to charge your number for a collect call. No prior written
agreement is required when the operator asks, "I have a collect call
will you accept the charges."  Therefore, the IP's said it is an
unfair advantage for telco to be able to work with verbal agreements
on charges to telephone accounts but for us to be required to have
written agreements."  And in these times in which we live -- the era of
post-divestiture and all -- the telco is required to deal with one and
all at 'arms length' as they say. If Western Union, an entity separate
and not associated with telco, is permitted to speak with you on the 
telephone and charge the cost of your transaction to your telephone bill
based on your verbal statements, then other vendors similarly situated
must be permitted to do so as well said one IP.  You dial an 800 number
to speak with the Western Union operator don't you?  It never occurred
to you that you were being 'charged for a call to an 800 number' when 
Western Union charges were placed on your phone bill, did it?  Good ...
now we understand one another.   PAT]

Subject: WKP, Infotext, and Carrier Assignments


I don't know of any way to identify 500 carrier assignments at the
moment, but if you are looking for 800/900 number assignments there is
a relatively quick (and cheap) way to do so.

  Infotext Magazine (the trade journal of the pay-per-call industry)
sponsors a toll-free audiotext service called The Interactive Exchange. 
It contains some useful information, including:

* 800 & 900 NXX CARRIER ASSIGNMENTS
  Let's you quickly access 800 and 900 NXX assignments.
  Just enter the 3-Digit NXX code.

* WEEKLY NEWS
  Weekly news updates on the pay-per-call industry.

* STATE INFORMATION
  Enter the two-letter state postal abbreviation to hear
  pay-per-call regulatory news for that state. A list of
  all area codes (including NANP) for that state is also
  given.

* CARRIER INFORMATION
  Supposedly updated information on new carrier features.
  All I ever hear when using this feature is the carrier's
  address and phone number. Press 'A' for AT&T, 'M' for MCI, and
  'S' for Sprint.

THE INTERACTIVE EXCHANGE: 1-800-321-TEXT

Like any voicemail-type IVR system, it seems to send you to
the wrong places at times, and can be a bit confusing. The price
is right though! You don't even have to pay for the phone call
(and NO, it is not an 800 number that bills you back onto your
phone bill).

  I would also highly recommend reading {Infotext Magazine}. It is
really the only publication (left) that caters to the 'service
bureau industry'. Just reading some of the ads from the service
bureaus gives an interesting insight into what is going on in
the industry. It is free to qualified subscribers. You can find
subscription info at our FAQ File homepage below.


P.S. FYI, I just looked at their latest issue, and guess who has
the centerfold ad?  WKP, Incorporated! Here is a little snippet of
their ad:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
WKP is the audiotext industry's only full-service carrier serving
domestic and international markets. WKP has emerged as the leader
in the US market providing solutions for all forms of domestic and
international dialing.

WKP Offers:
* All transport, switching, call processing and accounting.
* Multiple dialing plans including: 10XXX, 011, 500, 800 and
  many alternative transport vehicles.
* A choice of service bureaus that provide audiotext, live
  one-on-on (SIC), psychic, conference calling and many
  other live and recorded services.
* Billing company choices that process call records at WKP
  tariffed/dominant carrier rates.
* 800 billing on LEC Calling Card, Visa/Mastercard and Check
  Debit.
* Comprehensive fraud control and caller screening.
* Customized tag messaging.
* No start-up fees, no number fees and no minimum volumes
  required.

There is no secret here, Allnet and WCT were both purchased by
Frontier Communications *very recently*.  In fact, Allnet's
shareholders just agreed to the merger Wednesday.  Other companies
purchased include ConferTech, American Sharecom, Schneider
Communications, LinkUSA, and ETI.  The only company expected to be
operating under their old name after the merger is complete is
LinkUSA.  All of the other companies will become Frontier
Communications.

I think you are looking in the wrong place.  My guess would be that as
these companies merge, their traffic will be handled on the "other"
company's switches, etc.  Allnet probably has no idea that they are
carrying this traffic.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I was referring to 900-999. Those can
really get raunchy, and quite expensive. I guess we can assume the
adult phone services are like any other business in the 'community'
which a large segment of the community finds distasteful. Consider the
adult bookstore in your community: how many different times have
petitions been passed and motions made at city council meetings to
have them closed down or moved to a different location under the
guise of zoning restrictions, etc. People say adult bookstores and
prostitution should all be confined to a so-called 'red light district'
and as to be expected, the people involved in those businesses fight
such efforts to restrict them. You say they bring down the neighborhood
and cause a lot of 'victimless crimes' to occur. There is no such thing 
as victimless crime (if some action has been codified as a crime, then
by definition there are victims involved), but that is not the point I
wish to make. It takes a major effort to remove nuisances of that sort
if indeed there is any constitutional right to remove them at all. 

We sort of had it nicely controlled before with the equivilent of a 'red
light district' in the 900/976 territory. But when business started to
go to down because the assigned district was so out of the way and
difficult to reach that most citizens did not go past there on a regular
basis anyway, the merchants in that district decided they needed to
expand.  They moved out on Main Street once again with their wares in
plain view, knowing full well that as the poet John Bunyan said, "what
we say, and what we do, in real life are often two." 

So here they are once again on Main Street: Alexander Graham Bell Boulevard,
with new and shiny storefronts in the 500 block, instead of their old
location down in the 900 block where no one goes any longer except a few
people who still know ways of getting around all the barricades the
community put up down there. 

So *now* what do you propose to do people?  Block 500's as well?  PAT]

This one answers "Callback Services" with a voice-prompt menu offering
to connect you with various departments.  When you select "information

to bored office workers sitting around at four in the afternoon waiting

I have a friend who has, squirreled away in his garage, a very old
wood telephone, with the crank and all.  I offered to get it working
for him if he could find me an old 2500 set, to take the network from.
He got it, but when I went looking for my old ITT maintenance manual,
well, I couldn't find it.  Does anyone have a schematic for a 2500
set, so I can figure how do the wiring involved with this?

If this is in computer form, could you mail it to me?  I don't work in

This is utterly false.  There are no (zero) NPA overlays in California
and there is only one that is in VERY limited use in New York.  The
415/510 split was a split, not an overlay.  The 213/818/310 and
714/619/909 splits were splits, not overlays.  The 212/718/718 split
(I list 718 twice because the Bronx initially kept 212 but later moved
into 718) was a split, not an overlay.  The 917 overlay on 212/718 is
used only by a small number of cellular phones.  In none of these
cases were old users able to keep their numbers, except to the extent
that the original plan for 917 was abandoned.  (The plan was to force
all cellular and beeper numbers into 917.)

There is one planned NPA overlay coming to California, but the details
are still in flux.  I believe the first fully operational overlay in
the U.S. will be Houston, Texas, ACs 713/281, and the people in
Houston are NOT happy about it, either.

In California, all calls to a different NPA, whether local or toll,
must be dialed as 11 digits.  All calls within a given NPA, whether
local or toll, may be dialed as 7 digits.  Thus, from my home in San
Francisco, a local call to Oakland is 11 digits but a toll call to
Palo Alto is 7.

Subject: AT&T Credit For Cut Calls
Date: 22 Aug 1995 10:51:22 -0700
Organization: GINA and CORE+ Services of The California State University


It seems that AT&T now has a new policy on giving you credit for
calls of one minute. My BBS calls its Hub during the night to get
its mail and newsgroups. At times for one reason or another the
call will get cut off; maybe because of something in the network
or noise or god knows what; remember it is a modem and not voice.
Up until this month when I called to get the credit; most times it
is just a few cents and never amounts to much, but money is money when
you run a BBS and don't charge. 

Now they will not give you credit unless there is another call right after
the bad one. Well this last month was a real bad one and in one case
my system tried 14 times right in a row and never got connected; other
times it was just a time or two and then maybe did not get connected
because the other end got busy or did not answer. 

I took my complaint through the system and yesterday got a call from
the Ofice of The Chairman of AT&T, who said that a credit would be
issued for a grand total of $4.95 with tax. It seems that the manager
with AT&T at a lower level was willing to lose a customer for such a
be issued for a grand total of $4.95 with tax. It seems that the
manager with AT&T at a lower level was willing to lose a customer for
such a small amount because of their so called new policy. 

They would have lost both my phones as well as my wats line, which is
a lot more.  This person told me that they could not say that they
would issue a credit each month this happens, but if it is just a
couple of times I never even bother. The reason behind this policy is
they can't be sure if it is their equipment, local equipment or the
subscriber's equipment on either end and besides the phone circuts are
made for voice. 

Right on all of the above, but I never got anything for the call since
I was cut off, and the newer modems are made to work over the voice
network just fine as is proved by my 95% trouble free operation.  I
also pointed out that the modems we are using are made by AT&T
Paredyne, so maybe there is a problem with them. Also AT&T now has
Internet access and they will have the same problems we all have.  He
agreed that this is an ongoing problem that they will live with, this
was not the chairman and I don't think he will even hear about it, but
should this occur again I will move my service as with the small
users the costs are almost all the same, I have checked.


The above are my ideas and have nothing to do with whoever my employer is.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: They were not 'willing to lose your business
over $4.95', they were willing to lose your business because you nickle and
dime them to death month after month over credit for stuff that in all likely-
hood is *not* their fault. People seem to feel that whenever there is a
problem with a phone call the phone company is automatically at fault and
should be required to absorb the loss. I disagree.  AT&T and the local telcos
are usually more than generous about making allowances when there is any
question at all about who is at fault. The local telcos routinely write off
small amounts as a courtesy to the IXC's rather than charge them back for
investigation and the IXC's do the same for the local telcos. Rarely is it
worth the time to investigate *where* the fault occured in a telephone
connection.  Both the IXC's and the local telcos also write off a lot of
charges due to just plain customer stupidity and stubborness also; it costs 
less than it does to have to respond to a commission complaint filed by a 
subscriber who read some consumer journal and knows his rights by God! and 
wants his money back. 

Everyone knows that the human ear is far less sensitive to noise on
the line than a modem, and that the human brain can make sense out of
things a modem would be completely confused by. Telephones come with
receivers which are placed against your ear, not with modem connections.  
That over simplfies it a little, but I have seen idiots ask for credit
on the dumbest things.  A few years ago a lady goes to a payphone and
dials my *modem* number in error. Or rather, she dialed it correctly
because her basic premise -- the number she thought she wanted -- was
incorrect. She stands there at the payphone and makes five calls in a
row to my modem, then has the unmitigated gall to call up repair
service and report my number out of order 'because there are just loud
noises on the line when I call it.'  The repair guy calls me on my
other line to ask me if there is a problem. I told him there was not,
and he tells me about this lady, and how after turning me in to repair
then wants to know how to get back the money she lost in the payphone
due to this 'phone company screwup' ... everything is the phone company's 
fault, you see.

Ask the newspapers, ask any talking head on your television set. Area codes
change on every street corner?  Must be a plot by the phone company to
turn more local calls into long distance ones. As we used to say in years
past to CB'ers with poor quality radios, "Take it back to K-Mart or
Radio Schlock and demand a refund. Tell 'em to give you back your welfare
check for this month then go by a decent radio that doesn't sound like pooh!"
Put in 1995 terms, check those modems and their settings. Look for loose
connections on your own premises. Consult with other users of the same
hub and see if they also have hassles like this every night during the
National Mail Hour. Ask the sysop of your hub to relate his experiences.
Once you have completely eliminated yourself and your hub as the source
of this problem ... or at least 75 percent of it, *then* go to telco and
get your refund for this month. Otherwise quit bothering them.  And by
the way, if you think AT&T is stingy with refunds due to customer goodwill,
try one of the others you highly tout. See how soon they get a bellyful
of your complaints also.   PAT]

This suprises me.  I have an AGT Calling Card which *is* accepted by
AT&T.  I used it extensively this past week in Missouri, Colorado and
Montana.  AGT is the provincial phone company for Alberta, a member of
Stentor, the Canadian phone cartel.  Bell Canada is also a Stentor
company. Bell Canada provides service in Ontario and Quebec.  BC Tel
is the Stentor in British Columbia, Manitoba Tel in Manitoba etc.  MCI
is allied with Stentor as a whole, not Bell Canada individually so if
they were blocking Bell Canada cards it would seem that they would
also block AGT and other Stentor cards.  Are you sure AT&T blocks Bell
Canada cards or were you just told this by someone at Bell?

Stentor thrives on this kind of "dis-information" and other dirty
tricks to try to keep their monopoly grip on Canada. Stentor is
determined to thwart true competition despite laws providing for it
and the regulators are frustrated and powerless against Stentor's
financial muscle.  Stentor has armies of lawyers and lobbyists to
dilatory tactics and obfuscate the truth when responding to CRTC
queries.  Potential competitors are destroyed by Stentor's predatory
pricing and unfair competition; and Stentor is too stupid, closed
minded and anachronistic to realize that all the Bell Companies and
AT&T have benefited from competition in the United States.  Sales and
profits are up and markets are expanding for the Bells in the States.
Who suffers in Canada?  Canadian individuals and businesses who can
ill afford it considering the state of their economy.

The municipal utility company (Gainesville Regional Utilities (GRU))
that currently handles (reasonably competently) electric, water, and
gas is also beginning to participate in the telecom market. GRU is
currently leasing access to its fiber network for implementation of
MAN service.  The most notable use of this network has been by Shands
Hospital which is affiliated with the University. Due to physical
plant constraints a lot of outpatient facilities have been distributed
around Gainesville with the facilities linked via a MAN allowing the
remote sites to have the same sort of bandwidth available within the
primary facility.

I recall a quote attributed to a city commissioner who said something
to the effect that GRU would be providing local phone service
throughout Gainesville. I find this idea to be a little unsettling: I
doubt that the electric company (which has little or no experience in
telecom) is going to be able to compete with the big boys.

Interesting. Gainesville seems to have one of the cheaper ISDN rates
that I've seen: last year I was quoted $34/month for a residential BRI
within 15,000 feet of the switch with no usage charges for local connections.

The HR version was passed by the House of Representatives, the S
version was passed by the Senate.  These two bodies are seperate
halves of our legislative branch.  Once each decides independently
what they want in a bill, sometimes each holding separate hearings,
the two bills are sent to a conference committee made up of a few
members of the House and a few members of the Senate.  They decide
what is the same in each bill and take the differences and try to
decide which way to go.

Once the conference committee decides how the unified bill will look
it goes back to both the House and the Senate and must be passed by
both in its final form.  If passed it is sent on to the president, the
leader of the Executive branch of our government, for him to sign into
law.

If President Clinton decides to veto the bill (he has threatened this)
he sends it back for another possible vote in the House and Senate.
If both the House and Senate each vote a 2/3rds majority in favor of
the bill then they 'override' the veto and it becomes law.

When the conference committee gets done with the bill it will be voted
on again.  I don't believe that they have even started looking at it
yet.

HR1555/S652 will become a law when it gets through the remaining
steps.  Reading through HR1555 shows that the law will require the FCC
to set up regulations to enforce this law.  If anyone does not agree
that the FCC regulations are the same as the law they can go to court
(the judicial system is the third branch of government).

The states have similar arrangements as the federal government.  Each body 
as its own method of getting bills passed into laws requiring the PUC to 
write a conforming regulation.

The federal government has authority over the state governments.  The states 
cannot do anything that violates a federal law.  Likewise the PUCs must form 
regulations within their state's law.

If the federal law or conforming FCC regulation does not prohibit an 
activity and the state law does not prohibit the activity then the PUC can 
allow the activity.

LEC intraLATA service was permitted (and is standard) since the breakup of 
the Bell system.  Your LEC is the default carrier for all IntraLATA calls.  
Recently the IXCs have been asking people to use the 10xxx codes so that the 
IXC carrier carries the intraLATA calls.

The LECs want to provide interLATA service.  That is part of HR1555.
The IXCs want to provide LEC service.  Some PUCs have approved this
based on certain loopholes in the federal law, FCC regulations, and
their state laws.  HR1555 will permit this kind of service, and force
the old LECs to compete based on national rules instead of state
rules.

BA horror stories?  Should we start a contest?  Not that I dispute the
above, but I have a fresh-from-the-press story that indicates that all
is not well at the "front-office" either: Last week I ordered another
line.  I was told that since I do my own on-premises-wire maintainnence, 
I do *NOT* have to be there for the installation.  When I came back
from my client site the day installation was supposed to happen there
was a note and phone message telling me that they could not install the
line since I was not there.  Hmm, interesting -- but expected.  So, I
called and was promised an early installation (the next morning
between 8 - 10).  

When 10am passed without a show from our friend at BA, I called.  I
had to wait about 20 minutes to get through.  Then I was informed that
they do not have my new number as an install-item.  Ok, so "we" trace
the order by my current number.  Found.  Now I'm told that the person
assigned is delayed at another job.  Now I start to get annoyed.
First, they promised to be within the time frame.  Second, if they
have a problem -- they can call, after all they are the *PHONE* co.  I
inform the lady on the other end that I'm waiting just for the
installer, and that since I am paid by the hour I expect them to come
ASAP.  She promises me that the person will stop what he is doing and
come to my place NOW.  I wait.  I wait.  it is 11:15, no one is here.

I call again -- using a different number to try and cut the on-hold
time.  That worked.  I speak to another person (that still can't find
the record of my new number ...) and when she finaly finds it I'm told
that there was *NO ONE* assigned to the install, and it will not be
done before 5pm.  Now I'm angry -- real angry!  I ask to talk to a
supervisor.  The super is all apologies, yes they screwed-up, yes there
is a problem, what can they do to make me happy?  Of course, I say come 
install the line *NOW*.  Well, since it is after 11:30, and the union 
rules dictate a 12 - 1 lunch break, she can not promise me anything
will be done until sometime after 1pm.  

By now I wasted 3 1/2 hours, so I figure I cut the losses, and try for
the next day.  She promisses me (1) my install will be the first one
done the next day (right after 8am) (2) she will call to make sure it
was done right.  Next day: 8:50 - no one here.  I call.  As I'm being
transferred, a knock on the doorr.  It took an hour to get here? I can
drive from center city Phila to Princeton NJ or past Wilmingtom DE in
that time span.  But, at least some one is here.  The installer does
what they usually do, and comes back after 30 minutes with the big
news: he can not get a tone to any of the three free pairs I have.  It
seems the five pair I have goes somewhere, but not far enough (note that
I have two pairs working fine).  

So this is a job for the cable crew.  He tells me there was a
cable-person around the corner, and he told him about the problem and
it will be handled soon.  I insist on a phone number where I can check
on the status of the installation.  As soon as he leaves I call.  What
number? We can't find it ... oh, that works order, no -- we do not have
a cable crew assigned.  The next available crew just started a job and
we don't know when they will be over.  Time now: 10:30 or so.  I'm
pissed.  I tell them that this is not acceptable, and I demand someone
to come *now*.  OK, they say -- we will tell them to stop and come to
your place.  Good.  I wait. I wait some more.  An hour later -- no one
here (do I sound like a broken record???).  I call -- by the time I
reach the supervisor, a knock on the door.  The cable guy is here.

Great!?  Not quite.  He tests the wires and informs me that they seem
to be 180 and 100 feet long.  That distance goes nowhere close to the
junction box where they are supposed to terminate.  So, for the next two
1/2 hours he tries to figure out where the cables goes.  He can't.
The microfiche says one thing, reality is not quite the same. By 1:30
he gives up.  There is one possibility he can't check (cuz the people
are not there) so he will ask the next crew to try that location.  At
this point I'm ready to kill.  It is pretty clear that I'm not willing
to just sit there and wait, and we agrees to a temp solution: he will
extend the three pairs and leave the ends "exposed" outside, so the other
team can test and look, etc.  They will mark the "live" pair when it is
done.  Today is the day after -- needless to say, the supervisor did
NOT call back.  Also there was no sign that anyone was testing the
pairs last night when I came back ...

So, after this long saga, and almost a week after the order, there is
no line and not even an idea when one will be there.

I do have a question: does anyone know if there is a legal basis for
me to bill the BA for the wasted time (the first day -- when they
acknowledge that someone did lie to me and messed-up big time)?

On the other hand, this can result in benefits to the customer, so it
isn't always the customer that loses.  Example: When I switched LD
carriers, the new one put in the order to switch from 222 to 333 on my
line.  The order was put in, and the business office duly noted the
change, charged me the switching charge (which I'd already received a
check from 333 to cover).  But the switch program was never changed.
So, 222 closed my account, 333 created one for me, and I continued to
use 1+ LD dialing.  The result: 222 kept getting charged for the
calls, 333 had a zero balance, and I never saw the charges for calls
made during that time, since I no longer had an account with 222.  So,
I won, 222 lost, and if there is a scam, I would think that 222 would
want to expose it to keep from getting billed for closed accounts.

I actually didn't consider it a scam: more like technical doesn't
communicate very well with billing and so there are lots of
discrepencies.  It happens with any large company.

In the end, a call to repair to explain the situation got everything
corrected, since the tech could go in and look at the billing office
record, see that a change SHOULD have been made, then go in and change
the switch on the spot to match.

A rep called me one night and I wanted time to think about the package
and compare what I'd pay (and the "rewards") against what I currently
pay (and the rewards I get) using Sprint.  I asked for a number to
call back once I'd decided, and the rep gave me a number, but cautioned 
that the people at the inbound call center do not have the authority
to offer the same deals as the reps at the outbound call center.

Makes sense.  My guess is the reps who originate the calls have a
bigger list of enticements than the inbound call center.  After all,
if someone calls AT&T, then they must already be somewhat interested --
they're less likely to make a compulsive decision.

True. But there should be a way to handle cases like what happened to
me. Maybe the rep who offered me the deal could have made a entry in
their data bases against my phone number, so that when I called back
whoever received the call would know that. I was under the impression
that AT&T service was better than the others (well ... I was a AT&T
customer back in Arizona before moving to NorthWest) but now I would
think twice before switching to AT&T (with or withour $100 !)

Don't you hate it when people think the entire world is just like
their neighborhood?  In NYNEX territory, you cannot dial any inter-NPA
calls with seven digits. None, zero, zip. This is equally true in New
York City as it is in Derby Line VT. It used to be the case that local
calls across NPA borders such as 617->401 and 802->819 could be dialed
with seven digits, but a year or so ago they changed the rules so now
all inter-NPA calls are 11D, even free local calls.

It seems to vary by operating company: in highly urban New Jersey,
they've still managed to protect enough prefixes that all intra-state
local calls can be dialed with 7 digits (11D also works) although with
the continued growth in 201 and 908 it's hard to say how much longer
that'll be the case.

In the related area of whether 1+ means toll or means 11D, that's also
a deeply religious issue where the religion varies from area to area.
In New York, New Jersey, and California, toll dialing was never
closely associated with 1+, so in those states you dial intra-NPA
calls with 7D and inter-NPA calls with 11D, regardless of whether
they're local or toll. But in New England they must have had more SxS
exchanges since the PUCs in 5 out of 6 states mandated that all toll
calls must be dialed with 11D. (In New Hampshire it's a customer
option.) Local inter-NPA calls are dialed 11D as well, so 1+ means
"toll, maybe".

This leads to some rather silly situations, e.g. if you're in Boston,
all but about 25 of the prefixes in 617 are considered local, so you
have to remember a special rule for dialing Marblehead, Marshfield,
Whitman and a few other places in 617 that are toll from Boston. This
is particularly silly since Boston has a peculiar combination of rates
so that the message rate charge for a 7D "local" call to Lexington can
be considerably higher than for a "toll" call to Marblehead.

You'll have to define "small number of cellular phones".  As far as
cellular is concerned, last year CellOne NY/NJ forced all of its
existing 212 customers to have their phones re-programmed for new 917
numbers (the customers did NOT get the same number in 917, as the plan
is/was to combine all wireless services from 212 and 718 into 917).
They told 718 customers that they would have to be reprogrammed
sometime in the future.  BAMS/NYNEX "asked" their customers to change
earlier this year.  As of Jan 1, 1994 (or maybe even earlier), new
cellular customers were no longer assigned numbers in 212 or 718.

The last I heard, there was talk about moving upper Manhattan land
lines to either 917 or a new NPA within the next two years.  The
problem with moving landlines to 917 NOW is that a customer is not
guaranteed the same number in the new NPA, since it has been in use
for a few years.

   In general, 'the rule' is not based on metropolitan vs. rural, but
on a state-by-state LEC basis.  For example, the "Indiana rule" is for
Foreign NPA Local calls is '7D'.  The "Illinois rule" is '1+10D'.

   I believe the "1 + NPA local" communities in Indiana are really served by 
Illinois Bell (or at least are part of the Chicago LATA).  So they follow 
the "Illinois rule".

   North Antioch, while in Wisconsin, is served by the Antioch switch,
is in Illinois Bell territory and part of the Chicago LATA.  They do have
to make 'Toll calls' using 1+708 to reach Blue Island, violating the
usual Illinois rule of Home NPA Toll calls being '7D'.  And they violate
the Illinois rule for Foreign NPA Local calls by permitting '7D' to
North Antioch.  For all practical purposes, Illinois Bell treats North
Antioch as part of the 708 NPA, except for taxes, PUC rules, etc.

   But for MOST purposes, cross-NPA local calls are dialed '1 + NPA' in
Illinois, Alabama, Alaska (are there any such calls from Alaska??  To
Canada, perhaps?), California, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Wisconsin and
virtually all of the East Coast and the traditional Southern states
(Texas excepted).

   Maryland, part of Virginia 703 NPA (DC area treated like Maryland)),
DC itself, Missouri in the St. Louis area (314 NPA), Texas and all of
Canada have cross-NPA local calls dialed as '10D'.

   The rest (most of the West minus Pac Bell/Nevada Bell, and the Plains
states) uses '7D' for cross-NPA local calling.  Or doesn't have such
calling at all.

   Note that there are exceptions to the 1 + NPA and 10D rules in such
states, usually when a Foreign NPA is served by a switch in another NPA.
This happens a lot in Independent areas, which are typically 'rural'.
Thus the observation that '7D' is a 'rural rule'.


Al Varney


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: While Hammond, East Chicago, Whiting and
Gary, Indiana *were* part of Illinois Bell in the past, they have been
part of Indiana Bell for many years now. How they got to be part of Illinois
Bell in the first place is an interesting bit of history. If you go back to
the start of this century or before, John Rockefeller had his offices in
Chicago, but his refinery in Whiting. William Gary had the offices of 
US Steel in Chicago, but the steel mill in a small company town named after
himself on the shore of Lake Michigan just east of Whiting. As phones 
increased in popularity and usage and it got to the point that every
company had to have at least one <grin!>, Mssrs. Gary and Rockefeller
both thought it would be a good idea to have this new form of rapid
communication between their offices in Chicago and their respective
plant and refinery superintendents. The Chicago Telephone Company (Illinois
Bell's predecessor here prior to its purchase by AT&T in the early 1920's)
was more than happy to oblige, and soon wires were strung all the way to
the southern shore of Lake Michigan. Telephone directories for the period
about 1900 show but one entry each for that area: the Whiting Refinery,
ask operator for Whiting Toll Station 1; and the United States Steel
Gary Works, ask operator for Gary Works. 

US Steel also had their 'South Chicago Works' running but it was served
by the South Chicago exchange of CTC (which is perhaps why in much more
recent years when they were still in business there their phone number was 
SOUth Chicago-2111.) The CTC was more than pleased to get phone lines
installed all across the part of northern Indiana at the southern tip
of Lake Michigan with the industrial barons largely footing the bill
for the initial work. When AT&T bought CTC and put it into the 'Bell
System' family of companies under the name 'Illinois Bell' the existing 
contracts and arrangements in place were simply kept intact.

Earliest instance of 'reseller' that I can think of: when workers in
Gary (the company town) inquired about getting telephones of their own --
those who could afford it since Mr. Gary was chintzy with wages and most
of the 'salary' earned by the workers went back to US Steel to pay for
rent and merchandise from the company store -- who do you suppose supplied
it?  The Turner Telephone Exchange ... a subsidiary of US Steel run by
an executive of US Steel named, ummm .. Turner I think  <grin> ... In the
early 1920's the United States Supreme Court divested US Steel, just as
happened to AT&T sixty years later. Part of the deal was they had to
divest themselves of the Gary Municipal Corporation and anything to do
with the town. CTC/Illinois Bell took over the phone service aspect of
it. 

They all thought so highly of Mr. Turner that they retained his name
for the exchange, not once mind you -- but six times as the (now indepen-
dent) town of Gary, Indiana grew, prospered and required more and more
telephone service; i.e. Turner-2, Turner-3, Turner-4, Turner-5, Turner-6 
and Turner-7. The exchange split six times over the next forty or so years, 
with the subscribers asking the operator for five digit numbers of the 
form 2xxxx through 7xxxx. Gary 'went dial' in 1956 and it finally evolved
to where it is today as 219-882 through 219-887. Things, you see, don't
just happen by chance. There are reasons things are numbered the way 
they are as often as not, especially where the very, very old telephone
prefixes are concerned.  Then one day US Steel for all intents and
purposes closed down its Chicago area operation, and Gary went belly-up.
It, like the 'downtown' areas of Hammond, Whiting and East Chicago is now 
mostly just boarded up storefronts, and deserted streets. 

Another early 'reseller' of phone service was George Pullman. His company
town by the same name was just south of Chicago, and along with rent and
groceries which the workers bought at stores he operated in the town he
owned, they could get phone service from him also if they could afford
it. When he became 'enlightened' and decided to stick to making railroad
sleeping cars and servicing them (when attached to railroad trains around
the USA) he sold off the town of Pullman to the workers who incorporated
with their own government. Eventually the town of Pullman was annexed into
the City of Chicago whence it became the Chicago neighborhood known as
Pullman as it is today. From the days when the Emperor owned everything in
sight and had the telephone exchange named after himself comes our present
day 312-785 or PULlman, named after the man who used to own it all.   PAT]

There are reports that AT&T is all set to enter the local call arena
and provide some fierce competition. According to Newsbytes reports
they are ready to take a beating at first to gain ground in the
market.

What are the implications of this move?  How is AT&T going to do it?
Can we be looking at an era where we could get local, long distance,
cellular, pager, PCS and even online services through the same
provider?  What about monopoly fears, you think the courts/DOJ/FCC
will like this?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: As long as there are 'several monopolies'
to choose from, there should be no objection.  There was quite a large
article in the {Wall Street Journal} a couple days ago discussing this
very same thing. According to WSJ, the 'secret plans' of AT&T call for
a massive strike entry into the market early in 1996. I really suspect
they must have gone back and studied closely how Ted Vail did business
when he ran the company a century ago: move in, take such huge losses at
first that you bankrupt all your competition in the process, then consolidate
it all back into one large company. 

Ted Vail was like that, you know. When the patent on the telephone expired,
and AT&T no longer could prevent other people from manufacturing them,
that is when all the small independent telcos started appearing all over
the USA. Vail would send his representatives into a small town with an
independent telco to make an offer to buy the company. Some would sell out
when the price was good enough but even then, back in the early part of
this century, there was sufficient hostility to AT&T that many of the small
telcos flatly refused to sell out. Outraged, they would tell anyone who
wanted to listen that, 'we will never become part of the Bell ...'. They
wanted to retain their independence. 

Vail's response would be, "then fine, don't sell. See how much value your
service is to anyone when you can't interconnect with anyone else." He
would pull the plug, literally, and refuse interconnection, leaving a small
town telco with just whatever subscribers it had and nowhere to connect
them except each other. Then he would start a competing telco in the very
same town and of course, as part of the 'System' it would be interconnected
with other 'Bell System' telcos. **Then he would give the service away to
all new subscribers for six months or so ... whatever it took.** The day
the independent was driven out of business by these tactics was the day
the susbcribers to the new 'Bell System' company in that town had to start
paying, and paying plenty to make up for the losses to date. 

What's interesting about this alleged plan by AT&T to 'take over' local
service next year is that they already have several new switches in place
largely sitting idle waiting for the day to arrive when they go in
service and (according to the WSJ story) AT&T plans to do something quite
ridiculous and offer their existing long distance customers 'local area
service' for some very small amount of money; far less than what the BOCs
are getting. Full custom calling features, the works.  Interesting times.  PAT]

The Stentor group plays the same game the competition plays. And, what
do you classify as dirty tricks? Pricing competetive? Thats the name
of the game. "Squish the competition!" Like all other companies trying
to make it in this world.

What the heck is real competition? We have a regulated competition
here in Canada. The CRTC regulates the pricing of the Stentor telcos
the same as they did when they were not in competition. If we want
true competition, get rid of the CRTC. Anything the government touches
here always goes to hell. This one will too!

You mean Stentor's LD pricing is cheaper that the competition.  That's

Until the local competition is implemented in a year or three, things
are not going to be like the USA up here. After local goes, LD rates
here will drop drastically. The Stentor group still has to up keep the
local network. Policies of the past dictated that people out in the
boon-docks 60 miles away deserved telephone service as did the city
dwellers. Since LD traditionally helped upkeep this local network and
LD rates now being lowered below this help point, one of two things
have to happen. The Stentor group either drops out of local, which
won't happen, or the local rates go up. (Way UP!) As this happens,
local competition will start popping up because it becomes a viable
business. (At this point, it's not.) Then, with local costs not digging
into the funds anymore, LD prices go down as the competition comes in.

Can anyone give me a yes-or-no answer on whether Wiltel has stopped
passing Caller ID from one area to the next?

I regularly call from Houston to Colorado.  The Houston numbers are using
a Wiltel reseller, and the Colorado number would always get my Houston
telephone number on their Caller ID box.

For the past month, the Colorado Caller ID box has been getting "OUT OF
AREA" every time I call it.

When I call my Wiltel reseller, they are clueless.  So, I call the
Wiltel operator (00#), and they give me some 800 number to call for
more information.  At this 800 number, they say they "can't tell me"
the answer and that I will have to call my reseller to find out the
answer.  (Runaround).

The funny thing is, when I first signed up with this reseller, I would
ask "you transmit Caller ID" and I'd get "you betcha" from everybody.
Now, everyone seems to have forgotten what Caller ID is.  Caller ID
was transmitted, and was very useful, but it's gone, and my reseller
even raised by rates about two months ago.  Argh!

Subject: Snakes In The Net (was Allnet Tries to Hide....)


Yesterday I spoke with a high-level AT&T person who has put me on the
right information track in the "500" number situation. He informed me
of the following.

Bellcore is the agency that handles prefix assignments for the 500
NPA.  500-200 & 500-938 are actually ASSIGNED to WKP Communications/
Long Distance.  500-738 is assigned to International Teleservices Ltd.
of Los Angeles CA.

Brian Cartmell of WKP made the application for the prefixes for both
companies, so they may be related. My source indicated to me that
there are certain guidelines to be followed with use of the 500 NPA by
companies, among them, that they are not to be used by "Adult Services". 
He said he was aware of Mr. ("an old hand in that business") Cartmell
and WKP. My source also stated they were aware of WKP's reputation but
that they were assured by WKP that everything would fall within the
guidelines. My source said he would forword those guidelines to me and
I will post them here when received.

He was very disturbed by my report. He stated if there was a FORMAL
COMPLAINT and/or WKP was in violation of the guidelines, or they
willfully misrepresented themselves in the application, THE PREFIXES
CAN BE REVOKED!!! ;+)

So, ALLNET/Frontier et al may NOT be directly aware after all of what
is going on. Many times the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is
doing, and my impression is this was so filtered that they truly did not
know. They know NOW however :+), as the numerous calls from various VP's
indicate. So "tentative" apologies to ALLNET.

Pat, you are absolutely right in your analogy of the adult bookstore
and the "red light" district. I am not concerned about the content of
what they do, in fact I am a STRONG free speech advocate. But it
really galls me that these people polluted the 800 "block", and now
the "500" block of our neighborhood. You indicated in one response
that you thought it would be a good public service of TELECOM Digest
to expose these people. I AGREE!! I am willing to act as a clearing
house for this information, post file's and "alert" lists to the
archives, and to post findings and reports to this Digest. Interested?

One further note, (if you would indulge me for a few more lines) the
LAMEST phone call I received over the past few days was a d00d (sorry)
from "Bank One", whom I have no business relationship with whatsoever.
He said please call 800-939-3306 ext xxxx "it's important". WHY do you
suppose this number gets a reorder from pay phones and only works from
"regular" lines? WHY do you suppose there is no attendant, or live
person available anywhere or at any extension? (I don't have any
collection agencies after me.) Maybe that person will see this and
leave a more detailed message on my Voice Mail. Pretty lame attempt to
get a direct voice number (ANI) if you ask me. I wasn't born

In yesterday's {Mercury}, there was another article about Pacific
Bell's new network in San Jose.  A San Jose woman refused to allow
Pacific Bell to connect her house to the new network.  She legally has
this right, because Pacific Bell cannot install equipment more than ten
feet from the property line.  She said she is not interested in video
or internet service: though she does own a computer she doesn't have a
TV.

Pacific Bell finally agreed not to hook up her home, but they also
told her that she would lose her POTS service in a year or so when the
copper network is abandoned. She said that was fine with her, because
she doesn't want any part of the new technology.

The CPUC said that Pacific Bell has agreed to not pass network costs
on to customers through their basic service phone charges.  The
article also mentioned that since locla competition may be coming to
California, another company may buy Pacific Bell's then obsolete
copper network.

This analogy is flawed, (unless I have misunderstood).  People are not
objecting to the existance of these services but to their billing
practices.  To extend your scenario, the adult bookstore sends the
bill to me because whoever shopped there happened to get to main
street via my driveway.

It seems to me unfair to have a product the cost of which cannot be
determined until the purchase is made.  I think a mechanism should
exist for dynamically charging calls. Imagine how long the teleslime
would last if that $5/min popped up on a display before the call was
connected.

Obviously this would take a big investment for only marginal gain.
Encoding the "Billing Class" by using certain number forms (900) is a
fair trade-off.

> So *now* what do you propose to do people?  Block 500's as well?  PAT] 

What other option is there?  500s are a billing lottery unless you
trust who/what ever you are calling.  Folks who can't get through to
500s being used as intended will come to my attention much sooner than
people who are "only making a long distance call" to some landmine
500.

Right after I made the post I got a call from a tech at AT&T, they had
opened a ticket since there had been several complaints over a number
of months. It turned out that the Hub I call is right next to an
Interstate and the noise is truckers running hight powered CB radios.
They had been aware of it for years, but PacBell never took any
action. They are putting a filter; if that will help, never did on my
TV; to take care of the problem. By the way, I only called AT&T when
there were a lot of them, not just a few, and it was not the money as
I said it was always just under $5.00, but this was a real pain since
it slowed the net down.

I don't know what the demand is, but cable TV companies have already
thought about this.  For a while there was a company that distributed
a full newsfeed via the veritcal blank of WTBS (I think) and it was
available to anyone who bought a special modem and payed a monthly
fee, actually that service may still be around.  You got a high speed,
cheap, newsfeed but you had to send news via conventional nntp of uucp
methods.

There was also talk of cable companies setting up ppp connections over
regular phone lines, you'd send over the phone line but you'd receive
data via your cable TV hookup.  I've never heard of that going beyond
some test customers, but with the advent of deregulation it could
become more popular.

The new Southern Bell (BellSouth) phone book for Charlotte, NC arrived
this week, and I bet there are others on the Digest like me who do the
Steve Martin routine when they hear the phone book slam against the
door ("The new phone book's here!").

To quote directly from Page 10 of the White Pages:

"Calls into Charlotte's expanded area within North Carolina may be dialed 
with just seven digits.  Calls into Charlotte's expanded area within
South Carolina require the 803 area code plus seven digits - no need
to dial '1' before the area code."

I guess this is another case of "1+ means toll".  I had assumed that all
of the 10D inter-NPA areas had been changed to 11D.  I guess not.

Charlotte has a local calling area that covers a 40-mile radius from
the city all for a flat rate (something I'm not used to, coming from
NYNEX/NY).  It was also recently mentioned that Atlanta has the
world's largest local calling area.  Can someone confirm this?

They did do that. Heck, here in Oregon and Washington, up until the
introduction of N0X and N1X exchanges forced a change, the rules were
as follows:

Local inside NPA: xxx-yyyy
 Toll inside NPA: 1-xxx-yyy
Toll outside NPA: 1-NPA-xxx-yyy

I don't know of any cases of local calls acroos NPA boundaries, but I
suspect that they were dialed as seven digits, because my older copies
of exchange info for NPA 503 list a number of "protected" exchanges for
708 and the like.

Of course, since Jan 15, 1995, 1 + seven digits is not allowable *anywhere* 
in the NANP.

But both from previous discussions here, and helping people across the
US and Canada set up dialing translation tables for Fidonet mailers,
I'd have to say that the practice of "1 means toll" was far more
prevalent than the reverse (going both by area, and number of NPAs).

Take a good look at how long distance is dialed *now* (after the the
introduction of NNX area codes). There's a pretty clear pattern of "1
means toll" vs "dial it all as 7 digits" (10 for inter-NPA). It's
places like Califormia, New York, and Chicago that are not using 1 to
indicate toll. And these are the places where other "comsumer
unfriendly" practices such as *mandatory* measured service exist.

"1 means toll" is alive and well. And maybe someday, it'll penetrate to
the telephone hells like Chicago and LA. :-)

BTW, I have no problem with *allowing* 10/11 digit dialing of local
numbers. I think it makes sense. But I do think it'd a good idea to
have to dial a 0 or 1 before any long distance call. If nothing else,
it makes programming dialing equipment easier, because you can set some
defaults such that you won't accidentally treat a new exchange clear
across the state as a local call. Forcing the call to wait until
"cheap" time doesn't interfere seriously with delivering the email, but
it certainly prevents unpleasant surprises. (this is less critical now
that in-state rates are getting rational. But it's still a good thing).

That must be a fairly recent change.  About two years ago, I remember
having to make some phone calls at pay phones from Monterey to Sunnyvale
(both in 408) and having to dial the 1 before the seven digits.

In CBT-land (parts of 513, 606, 317) we can use seven digits for
'local' calls.  I can call across NPA boundaries to points in Northern
Kentucky (606) and Southeastern Indiana (317)

We recently lost the ability to do 1+ seven digits (now all TOLL calls
are 1+ ten digits), but that's a small price to pay.

The Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana Public Utilities Commissions disagree
with you.  1+ still serves a 'Toll-Alerting' feature, indicating that
the call will cost more than a local call.  When the phone companies
react to Internet Telephony and make all calls cost the same, then we
won't need the 'toll alerting' feature anymore, I suppose :-)

The above it not always true. Some years ago the City of Riverside,
California put a transformer in my back yard next to my house on the
ground. They did it without asking or checking for right-a-way or
easement. They did a lot of damage working on it over the years. I
always claimed they had not right to put it there, but they said they
had my permission in writing, they would not or could not show me
their claim. 

In time it finally after years fighting them I got it to court, the
paper they had was an eaement, but it was a copy and from what it
looked like they had copied my signature onto it from something else
and then just copied it over. They could never produce the form They
then claimed that even though they may not have had the paper they had
the right to have it there since it was needed to supply me my power.
That did not hold up since it also supplied the whole block. It turned
out because of a change in the planning department that the city
required for the builder to get his permits, the house was build
there, where that would have been the street. 

What finally happened was I was paid for ten years of it being there
and they finally moved it. The judge said that they did not have the
the right to just take the property and on top of that the placment
violated the cities own electrical regulations. 


The above are my ideas and have nothing to do with whoever my employer is.

Yes, but PacBell wants to install equipment where they currently have
no easement rights.  Remember, these boxes are to be placed *every 10
to 12 houses* in the front yard.  The city contends that since there
will be so many of these amplifier boxes, Pacific Bell should try to
negotiate the location with the homeowner.

I certainly wouldn't want the telco coming out and saying "Well, we're
putting our box here and we want to rip out this concrete work here, and
some of your trees."  I personally wouldn't mind have an amplifier box in my
yard, but I would like to have a little control over *where* it would be
placed (ie: somewhere that's not very noticeable).

You want it fully automated?  I think it's scary!  But then again, I
know 411 operators, they support their families with their jobs, etc,
yakity shmack. I know you probably don't care, so I won't go on.

   But the first thing I thought of was Berbet Doodah.

   When I was working 411 one night, we had a caller come in who
wanted Berbet Doodah. The operator looked for it, checked the
spelling, didn't find it, and the customer would not accept that. So
he was routed to the SA.

   Now I get him. We checked the spelling again, phonetically, "B for
Bravo?" "Chess!" "E for Echo?" "Chess!"etc. until we had spelled out
Berbet Doodah. I checked the whole area code, reversed the words
(Doodah Berbet) and even went through the Residence files. No Berbet
Doodah!

   I informed him of this, and now he was very upset. I asked him if he
was sure of the spelling, and he started to spell it phonetically again,
only this time, it was  "B as in Bictory, E like Edward, L rike Rarry, B
like Bictory, E like Edward, T like Tango, nest vord T like Tango, U like
Umbrella," etc, etc. until he had spelled out enough to parse it together
as "Velvet Turtle", a local restarant. As I was giving him the number, I
was glad I wasn't his waitress. ;-)

   Let's see what your automated system does with Berbet Doodah!

      Why Did My Penn State Successful Dial-Up Connection Drop?
                          A Checklist
 
                         by H. D. Knoble
                            08/15/95

                   Office of Telecommunications
 
Once an Access dial-up connection is established at a data rate
compatible with your modem and serial port to Penn State TCP/IP
services, the connection may drop; the following is a check list of
possible reasons for this specific scenario. We recommend that you
copy and check this list before calling for technical assistance if
and when you experience seemingly random connection drops
(disconnections).  This not only will help us; but it will help you
improve the reliability of your microcomputer communications. The
checklist follows:
 
(1) a) Between the hours of
 
                   Monday-Thursday -- noon to midnight,
                   Friday -- noon to 6:00 p.m., and
                   Sunday -- 6:00 p.m. to Midnight,
 
       the CAC Serial Protocol (dial-up) servers (xxx-xxxx, xxx-xxxx,
       and phone numbers at other Penn State locations) drop data
       (drop the modem connection) after 1 hour of Internet activity
       or after 15 minutes of inactivity. "Inactivity" is defined as
       no Internet data exchange. E.g., using Eudora to compose a letter
       taking more than 15 minutes to compose it while using no other
       Access clients; e.g., while connected using any Windows applica-
       tions that are not Access clients - like Word Perfect, Excel,
       etc. - for more than 15 minutes at a time would cause no Internet
       data exchange and so would be considered Internet "inactivity."
 
    b) Twenty-four hours per day, the OTC Serial Protocol (dial-up)
       servers (xxx-xxxx) drop everyone after one hour of inactivity.
       "Inactivity" is defined as no Internet data exchange.
 
    This was done because some people were staying connected (using
    a Server rack modem) for hours (sometimes 24 hours) at a time,
    even when not using their PC; therefore many others were often
    getting a BUSY signal when dialing the Servers.
 
(2) In addition to (1) above, when accessing specific hosts through
    Telnet/TN3270 the following applies:
    a) For LIAS (or dial-up connections to LIAS) after approximately
       6 minutes of inactivity, the connection is dropped. After 5
       minutes of inactivity a message and a beep is sent; then after
       1 more minute of activity the connection to LIAS will be
       dropped.
    b) For OAS, 15 minutes of inactivity causes re-authentication via
       password; after one hour of inactivity, the connection is then
       dropped.
 
(3) For both CACSLIP (DOS clients) and CACTWIN (Windows clients)
    (rarely for MacTCP), some screen savers (some TSR's in general)
    do interfere with communications. Typical symptoms in this case
    are "random" line drops (when screen saver kicks in/out), and
    file transfer via FTP interrupted and aborted. We do not recommend
    running screen savers or other timer-related DOS Terminate and
    Stay Ready programs when using modems--period.
 
(4) For Windows Access clients, a Windows GPF (General Protection
    Fault) may cause the connection to be dropped. Please see the
    file: pub/dos/windows/gpfguide.txt on FTP.CAC.PSU.EDU for more
    about Windows General Protection Faults.
 
(5) There are lots of external (environmental) causes for faulty
    modem communications, especially (but not only) for high-speed
    (14.4/28.8) connections. Most of these are related to the phone
    line itself. Sometimes (but rarely) this is a Bell Atlantic
    problem. More often the problem is related to the phone line
    between the phone jack and modem, or serial connection between
    modem and microcomputer serial port. Our recommendations, based
    on years of experience and experiments involving actual cases,
    follow:
 
    a) Do not route the phone line within three inches of any
       electrical cord or extension cord, or PC CPU cord, or
       Printer cord, or Monitor cord, or any electrical appliance
       or power supply. This often means taping or stapling the
       phone line away from such places between jack and modem.
       Symptoms are random dropping of the line, problems with
       TCP/IP clients, logging in, etc. Inductance from electrical
       lines wreaks havoc with phone lines.
 
    b) Do not route a phone line being used by a modem through
       answering machines. Some of the "smarter" (and cheaper) ones
       have been known to intercept/inject data, which of course is
       undesirable.
 
    c) Do not route a phone line underneath a carpet since people
       probably will walk on it, thus crushing the very fine wires
       therein. The same is true for running phone lines where
       doors will close on them, etc.
 
    d) Do not use old phone lines from jack to modem. Use a new phone
       line of the correct length, without splicing (splicers also
       have been known to cause loose connections, and thus problems,
       in some cases).
 
    e) For external modems, if your serial adaptors or serial cable
       is old, adaptor pins bent, or cable cracked, replace them.
       Make sure your serial connections are TIGHT. Parts (a) and
       (c) above above also apply to serial cables.
 
    f) For internal modems, and for all microcomputers in general,
       dust buildup on internal components compromises built-in PC
       cooling systems. While any PC is running, fans circulate air
       around internal components. We recommend that after unplugging
       all related electrical connections, you remove the CPU cover
       and carefully blow dust off all computer components, including
       internal modem cards, at least once a year; compressed air cans
       (purchased where electronic components are sold) or reversible
       vacuum cleaners may be used this purpose. Dust free components
       PREVENT communications problems.
 
    g) Surge protectors for both computer power and phone connections
       are recommended. But we recommend that you unplug your
       computer and modem during electrical storms (which may do more
       than interfere with a TCP/IP dial up connection).
 
6) When dialing with a modem through a phone with the Bell Atlantic
   feature "Call Waiting", if "Tone Block" is not activated
   (i.e.,Call Waiting is not canceled for this call) then if someone
   calls after such a dial-up connection has been made, it is highly
   likely that the data connection will be dropped. (Please see page
   43 of the 1995-1996 Bell Atlantic phone book for State College for
   information.) That in fact is most often the case if the connection
   is via CACSLIP or CACTWIN via CAC or OTC Serial Protocol servers.
   One activates tone block (downtown State College) by prefixing
   the four characters "*70," to the phone number to be computer
   dialed; for example: *70,xxx-xxxx. The CACTWIN and CACSLIP
   install/customization menus provide the option to select dial-up
   numbers with the tone block prefix.
 
(7) Hours of availability for the Penn State Data Backbone
    are advertised as follows by OTC:
    "Normal operating hours for the Data Backbone are from 7:30 a.m.
    to 5:00 a.m.; 5:00 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. is the time designated for
    normal maintenance. Most often, the historical record shows that
    the maintenance period was given over to normal operations.
    However, normal maintenance may disrupt the data backbone so no
    guarantees about quality are made for the normal maintenance
    time."
 
(8) Finally, the Backbone, a Nameserver, Router, or Mainframe
    (such as PSUVM, LIAS, or OAS) is down or was down (or hung, or
    overloaded) when the problem was being experienced. One of the
    CAC Help Desks can help confirm these instances. Call them
    AFTER you checked out possibilities (1) thru (6) above:
    (1) and (2) can be monitored by being alert and using a watch;
    (3) thru (6) should be attended to as regular maintenance as
    good computing practice.

Subject: UCLA Short Course on Optical Fiber Communications
Date: Thu, 24 Aug 95 18:37:00 PDT


On September 26-29, 1995, UCLA Extension will present the short course,
"Optical Fiber Communications: Techniques and Applications", on the
UCLA campus in Los Angeles.

The instructors are Tran V. Muoi, PhD, President, Optical Communication
Products, Del Hanson, PhD, Principal Engineer, Hewlett-Packard, and
Richard E. Wagner, PhD, District Manager, Bellcore.

This course offers a review of optical fiber communications
fundamentals, then focuses on state-of-the-art technology and its
applications in present and future communication networks.

The course begins with the major building blocks of optical fiber
communications systems (fiber and passive components, sources and
transmitters, detectors and receivers).  Actual design examples of
fiber optic links for short-haul and long-haul applications are
studied, and recent technological advances in addressing problems due
to fiber loss and dispersion are presented.

The impact of fiber optic technology on communications is highlighted
in the latter half of the course.  Recent developments in local and
metropolitan area networks to support multimedia traffic (i.e., data,
voice, and video) and their evolving architectures and standards are
fully covered.  The treatment on telecommunications systems includes
various technological options for subscriber networks, exchange
networks, and the global undersea networks.  Network architectures
evolving from the traditional telephone and CATV networks are
contrasted.  Technology trends and directions for realizing the
so-called information superhighway are examined as well.  Finally,
optical networks using wavelength routing and multi-wavelength
cross-connects are presented.

The course fee is $1295, which includes extensive course materials.

   Out of curiosity, and an engineer's natural tendency to want to
understand the order of magnitude costs of things, I'd like to have
even the roughest estimate of what it costs to send, say, a megabyte
of data from one point to another over the Internet?

   I appreciate this is a very poorly defined quantity and that these
costs are spread (and hidden) all over the place.  But, let's say we
peel out all the costs (hardware, software and peopleware) associated
with what people do with Internet data after they get it, or the costs
of generating it before they send it, and just consider some
reasonable estimate of the transmission costs (phone lines) plus some
reasonable estimate of the real costs associated with the activities
of individual Internet nodes in receiving, processing and passing on
data that flows through them.

   How much, averaged in some way over all the worldwide links, to send a
megabyte (or a gigabyte, if a megabyte is too small) from here to there?

Currently I found the following:

- France (minitel) >> http://www.epita.fr:5000/11/
- Italy (Electronic Yellow Pages) >> 
http://www.saritel.interbusiness.it/pge/LoginPgeEn.html
- Switserland (Telecom) >> http://etv.eunet.ch/cgi-bin/etvq

I need to look up adresses and telephonenumber for my genealogical
research.

Please mail me if you know any other online telephone directories.

I am looking for people to evaluate a few text to speech systems and 
grade the quality based on fidelity and proper conversion to spoken 
English (American).

This will be blind test where you will receive wave(.wav) file output 
from the various systems and the text that they all read and a 
questionaire to fill out and return.

Please let me know if you can help me out.

I am not a developer of any of these, just wanting to get several peoples

Pat writes in Volume 15 Issue 349:

Except that the story has appeared in this newsgroup/digest twice before

 -- in January 1990 in Volume 10 Issue 12, and again two and a half
years later in Volume 12 Issue 667.  It turns out that the previous
posting was transcribed by Pat from tape, but this time he was
reconstructing the story from memory.

It was at my suggestion that Pat reran the article in 1992, but after
making the suggestion then, it occurred to me to have a look at the
applicable section of Richard Rhodes's superb book "The Making of the
Atomic Bomb" (Simon & Schuster, 1986, ISBN 0-671-44133-7).  The book
turns out to imply, on pretty good evidence, that there is something
quite wrong with Mrs. Fermi's story.

Following is the "rebuttal" which I wrote in 1992.  Text quoted with
"|" signs is from the accurate version of the story, as posted then.
Notes that are [[double-bracketed, like this]] are being added this
time, in 1995.

                             ---+---

Let me summarize the timetable:

|  "The test was set for 4:30 AM the next morning, so we returned to the
|  hotel and went to bed early. We got up at 3 the next morning and drove
|  out to the location ...

The chronology that she gives after that is:

4:45... they return to town to telephone, but can't get the operator.
5:00 or just after... Fermi finds and wakes up the operator.

They are back at their observation point 5 minutes before the explosion.

|  .... later, we got together with the others who had
|  been assigned there and found out that it wasn't the rain that delayed
|  things; it was that woman asleep; you see, the main people responsible
|  were linked by phones through Alamogordo; they had to coordinate what
|  they were doing and sychronize their work. All of them got the same
|  thing on the phone we got: no answer from the operator for 45 minutes!

So this would imply that the operator's nap started at about 4:15, if
not earlier.

Okay, now to Rhodes.  On page 664 of my copy:

#  [Robert] Oppenheimer, [Gen. Leslie] Groves, [Kenneth] Bainbridge,
#  [Gen. Thomas] Farrell, [Richard] Tolman and an Army meteorologist met
#  with [the meteorologist for the test, Jack] Hubbard at McDonald Ranch
#  at four that afternoon [the day before the test] to consider the
#  weather.  ...  They decided to wait and see.  They had scheduled
#  a last weather conference for the next morning at 0200 hours;
#  they would make up their minds then.  The shot was set for 0400
#  and they let that time stand.

As a source for at least part of this paragraph, Rhodes cites "The Day
the Sun Rose Twice" by Ferenc Morton Szasz (Univ. of N.M. Press, 1984).

Now on page 666:

#  Thunderstorms began lashing the Jornada [del Muerto] at about 0200
#  hours ...  Winds gusted to thirty miles an hour.  Hubbard hung
#  on at Zero for last-minute readings -- only misting drizzle had yet
#  reached the tower area -- and arrived eight minutes late for the
#  0200 weather conference at Base Camp, to find Oppenheimer waiting
#  for him outside the weather center there.  Hubbard told him they
#  would have to scrub 0400 but should be able to shoot between
#  0500 and 0600.  Oppenheimer looked relieved.
#
#  Inside they found an agitated Groves waiting with his advisors.
#  "What the hell is wrong with the weather?" the general greeted
#  his forecaster.  ...  Groves demanded to know when the storm would
#  pass.  Hubbard explained its dynamics: a tropical air mass, night
#  rain.  Afternoon thunderstorms took their energy from the heating of
#  the earth and collapsed at sunset; this one, contrariwise, would
#  collapse at dawn.  Groves growled that he wanted a specific time,
#  not an explanation.  I'm giving you both, Hubbard rejoined.  ...
#
#  Oppenheimer applied himself to soothe his bulky comrade.  Hubbard
#  was the best man around, he insisted, and they ought to trust his
#  forecast.  The others at the meeting--Tolman and two army meteor-
#  ologists, one more than before--agreed.  Groves relented.  "You'd
#  better be right on this", he threatened Hubbard, "or I will hang
#  you."  He ordered the meteorologist to sign his forecast and set
#  the shot for 0530.  Then he went off to roust the governor of New
#  Mexico out of bed to the telephone to warn him he might have to
#  declare martial law.

For all of this material, Rhodes again cites Szasz, but he notes that
Szasz in turn cites Hubbard's *contemporary* personal journal.  This
is pretty solid evidence, unless Hubbard had some reason to falsify it.
The signed forecast would be even better evidence: has anyone seen it
or seen it reproduced somewhere?  According to Rhodes, Hubbard gave it
to Bainbridge at "about 0508", following which the master switches were
unlocked and the bomb fired with a 20-minute delay.

There is further evidence that the telephones were not all down during
the period that Mrs. Fermi mentions.  From page 667 of Rhodes:

#  The meteorologist prepared his final forecast at S-10000 [the command
#  center, 10000 yards south of Zero].  He called Bainbridge at 0440.
#  "Hubbard gave me a complete weather report", the Trinity director
#  recalls, "and a prediction that at 5:30 am the weather would be
#  possible but not ideal.  ...  I called Oppenheimer and General
#  Farrell to get their agreement that 5:30 would be T = 0."  Hubbard,
#  Bainbridge, Oppenheimer and Farrell each had veto power over the shot.
#  They all agreed.

Rhodes cites a different source for this: "All in our Time" by Jane
Wilson (Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 1975).

There is a further problem with Mrs. Fermi's story, which is this:
the Trinity test site is 60 miles from Alamogordo!  From her account
it seems to be at most a 25-minute drive from the telephone exchange
to the observing point, which she says is 15 miles from the site.
(Unfortunately, while Rhodes mentions something about what Fermi did
during the test, he doesn't mention where he did it.)

[[ In the version posted this year, she doesn't say how far the observing
   point is from the Trinity test site, but does say it's 5 miles from
   Alamogordo, and refers to people being stationed *50* miles out.
   I guess Pat remembered *part* of this exchange of postings from 1992,
   and unconsciously adjusted the distances this time to fit the times.

   Before I found out that the recent posting was unreliable for fine
   detail, it occurred to me that Mrs. Fermi might still have had an
   Italian accent in 1965, really said "50 miles", and Pat misheard it
   when transcribing the tape in 1990.  Unfortunately for this explanation,
   the complete sentence is: 

   | It was set up that the scientists were deployed over about a
   | two hundred square mile area; we were about fifteen miles from
   | the target.

   A circular area of 200 square miles would have a radius of just 8 miles.
   Of course, the observing locations need not have formed a complete
   circle.  In fact the main observing points were 10 miles out.  I don't
   know if Fermi was at one of those points, though. ]]

I am left with three possible interpretations.  One is that Mrs. Fermi's
story simply never happened.  A second is that it happened exactly as
she said, except that after 20 years she got some of the times wrong,
while Hubbard participated in a cover-up, and Wilson's source was also
misleading.

And the third, which I think most likely, is that Fermi's drive into
town did happen, but the operator's nap did not really affect the timing
of the test.  In this interpretation, not all the telephones for everyone
went through that operator; perhaps it was only the lines between the
test site and the hotels where the scientists were staying, say.  (Also,
maybe the operator was not in Alamogordo but in a smaller town closer to
the site, such as Tularosa or Carrizozo.)  Maybe what someone really said
was that they had been afraid that the test would have to be cancelled
because certain people couldn't be telephoned, and then it was all right.

I dunno.  I'd like to believe the original story.  But the evidence...

Subject: A Few More Notes About TWX
Date: Fri, 25 Aug 95 13:47:00 GMT


This article is about the operation of a TWX from a user's view,
during the DDD period, 1962-1982, when TWX was an *integral* part of
the DDD Telephone network- whether AT&T owned it outright, or during
the 1970's, when it was a marketing function of WUTC but still
routed/switched/numbered/dialed over the Bell System's DDD Telephone
network. This is when The Bell System DDD (AT&T Long Lines with its
Bell Op.Companies, and interconnecting 'independent' GTE's, etc) was a
predominantly Crossbar switched network, and Common Channel Signalling
was only a theory at Bell Labs, when inbound MF address and SF
supervisory signals were the thing.

When Bell automated the TWX network and retrofitted Model 28 teletypes
with a dial/handset-earpiece/modem/keyset control, and the 'teen'
series (Model 10, 14, 15) teletypes had a '6-line-keyset-500-deskset'
telephone (with mouthpiece insert removed/disconnected) in 1962/63,
all TWX teletype machines were only 3-row keyboards, 60-66 Baud,
5-level Baudot punch-tape code. They had numbers assigned with their
geographic telephone NPA, plus seven digits, using a centrally located
NNX code for that city or region, ususally that of a #5XB.

A year or so later, Bell began the N10 special areacode series of TWX,
4-row keyboards, Model 33 & 35 TTY machines, 8-level ASCII punch-tape
code, and 100-150 Baud rate, with a built in speaker, dial or
touchtone pad, modem, and built in 6-keyset control.

For dialing purposes- you pressed 'originate' on the control keyset
(or associated modified 500 deskset telephone), listened for regular
dialtone thru the 'half-a-handset', earpiece, or microphone-disabled
500 set handset.  You dialed *the full ten digit number* of the TWX
customer you wished. There was NO prefix of 1+ no matter WHAT type of
TWX machine you were calling from, even if your area DID USE a
mandatory 1+ for toll telephone DDD. For the most part, TWX machines
got dialtone from a #5XB office, regardless of where they were
located. Even if a TWX was out in the 'sticks', it usually was FX-ed
to get dialtone from a nearby specially modified #5XB office, however,
INCOMMING calls could be routed thru its own local telephone Step by
Step, Panel, #1XB, or non-modified #5XB office. This special
arrangement was known as 'divided-line' access. I think that many
TWX's on the 510 special areacode were the original divided line
access customers, altho' they could have been upgraded later on, but
still kept the 510 special areacode. Within a matter of seconds, you
either got ringing, busy, reorder, recording, whatever. If it rang and
was answered manually or automatically, you then heard the 'modem'
high pitched tone for a few seconds, handshaking occurred, then the
loud high tone was disabled from your speaker or earpiece, and
data/text transmission occurred (answerbacks first).

As I stated in my earlier article, for the most part, regular
telephones could NOT dial N10 areacodes, but 3-row keyboard TWX
machines (with regular geographic telephone areacodes) could; they'd
HAVE to, since they were TWX to TWX calls! N10 (4-row keyboard) TWX
machines could dial to ANY N10 or geographic telephone NPA-NXX code,
EVEN IF THE TELEPHONE NUMBER WAS A TELEPHONE! Since there was no way
to speak, the person on the telephone receiving the call would just
keep saying 'Hello, Hello, Hello' and then hang up, thinking they were
getting a 'bad' call, just like fax users or data users today dialing
(by mistake) telephone users. You would hear ALL voice/speech thru
your earpiece or half-a-handset or built-in-speaker. You COULD enter
the full ten digit number for any local Time/Weather/Temp service and
'broadcast' it on the speaker on Model 33 & 35's! If you were on a N10
4-row keyboard machine, you'd probably chalk-up a charge for that
call, since it was ID'd by the #5XB as a N10 origination. However, a
3-row keyboard geographic telephone NPA machine *might* not chalk-up
any charges, since it was 'local-telephone' call (this was WELL BEFORE
any 976-PAY-PAY-PAY-per-call-numbers, too!).

I remember visiting the local offices of WUTC, WUIntl, ITT, RCA
Americom/Globcom, TRT, etc. back when I was in high school in the late
1970's, requesting TWX/Telex directories and user's manuals, and
seeing how the USER managed a TWX machine, including calling up the
local weather report's telephone number!

Using a TELEX machine involved pressing an originate key, but NOT
hearing any dialtone. On WUTC Telex, a lamp lit up under the rotary
dial, you spun the dial just like a telephone, and when there was a
data connection, the motor in the machine turned on, answerbacks were
exchanged, and you could send/type your message. On ITT, RCA, WUI,
TRT, FTC, etc. domestic telex 'private' networks arranged for
primarily international calls, you either pressed originate, or you
turned a knob switch from 'off' to line, your motor turned on right
away, a line and data connection was established with that IRC's
switch, you got the switch's ID code, and you TYPED your destination's
telex number, similar to the way it was in many foreign countries,
according to THEIR telex directories instructions pages! Busy circuits
and other 'call progress' info was TYPED by the switch onto your
machine's paper roll-except for WU Telex machines, where the lamp
underneath the plastic dial would blink or flash at specified rates.

BTW, the dial or touchtone pad on TWX terminals did NOT have the
letters- only numbers! Except for the oldest (teen series model 10,
14, 15) terminals which had an associated BLACK 500-deskset, rotary
dial, with 6-key controls- THAT had the regular dialface with letters,
numbers, 'Operator' over the zero! BUT since telephone numbers were
assigned to TWX in 1962/63 (when automated by integrating it with the
DDD Telephone network), 'ALL-NUMBER-CALLING' was being phased in, and
even if the NPA-NNX code for TWX had an exchange name at one time, NO
TWX numbers were ever identified as '504-VAlley-2-5XXX'; only as
504-822-5XXX, which was the series of numbers used in the New Orleans
metro area for 3-row keyboard TWX machines in the 1960's and 70's.

How far we've come now with email & the Internet! (and let's not
forget Fax machines, too!).

Subject: India's VSNL Offers Corporate Domains, Internet Access


-==This Indian Techonomist bulletin (C) Copyright 1995 Rishab Aiyer Ghosh

India's VSNL offers corporate domains, Internet access for $800

August 25, 1995: India's overseas communications monopoly, Videsh
Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), will allow corporate users of its new
Internet service to have their own domain names. Although individuals
can pay $160 for 250 hours of use, institutions have to pay $300 to
$800 for the same use, if they choose to connect through dial-up
lines.

Amitabh Kumar, VSNL's Chief General Manager for Planning told The
Indian Techonomist that corporate users will be able to register their
own domain names - such as techonomist.com.in - through VSNL's name
server, and will have multi-user accounts. The only previously
announced distinction between institutional and individual dial-up
accounts was that the former would only get shell access.

Although VSNL's service is a result of loopholes defining its monopoly
- it is strictly speaking a "gateway" to the Internet outside India,
and cannot provide connectivity within the country - it seems happy to
encourage competition. This is not very surprising, as VSNL makes
money anyway - the overseas communications link must be acquired from
it, even by competing Internet providers.

Competing providers don't exist, thanks to government restrictions on
datacom (see http://dxm.org/techonomist/dcom.html) - but Mr Kumar said
VSNL is "discussing [this] with the DoT," and would "prefer to work
with Internet service providers while providing wholesale services to
them." Mr Kumar adds that VSNL is prepared "to meet the requirements"
of datacom after deregulation of restricted "value added services."

Meanwhile, the first week after the launch of VSNL services has gone
reasonably well, with individual accounts growing the most rapidly.
Service is available through the Department of Telecom's national X.25
network, I-NET, and through local calls from Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta
and Madras. VSNL claims it will connect Bangalore and Pune, two
centres of much hi-tech activity, later this year. The excuse for this
delay of some months is lame - apparently a lack of space to locate
their servers.

A more likely reason is the nature of the loophole that lets them
offer the service at all - their limited rights to provide last-leg
connectivity for overseas traffic. GPSS, an old VSNL X.25 gateway, is
also available only in India's four major cities.

We have this kind (?) of telephone cards in Sweden.  They're not
reusable and only carries a number of units.  Of course this will be
expanded to real smart cards sometime in a not to distant future.  I
think the French have real smart cards in their pay-phones, I'm almost
sure they've got cards that don't run out of units.  Whether they're
smarter than that I don't know.

Using smart cards for identification is very secure and can be used by
e.g. banks.  There are a great number of tests being carried out at
the moment, I don't know all to much about France and France Telecom.
But they've been pushing for smart cards for a looong time now.  There
has been French tests with pay-phone-and-ATM card all in one.  There
was however great administrative problems since neither France Telecom
nor the banks wanted to give up to much control to the other part.
Ergo failure.

We have smart card styled SIM cards carrying the equivalent of the ESN
etc in GSM phones and there are no technical problems with expanding
this for home use, i.e. having a home terminal plugged in the wall and
thus implementing UPT.  The main driving force for smart card home
terminals isn't very likely going to be UPT but rather new banks not
wanting to invest in offices having a lot of staff etc.

Of course the telecom business has be active so that they can use the
terminals and the cards for telephone services too.  I.e. not only
secure transportation and identification over the telephone network
but also personal telecom services.

"New banks" could be insurance companies, larger corporations etc.
This will revolutionize the banking business -- and if the telcos play
their cards right -- and the telecom business.

The major obstacle is again who's to have control over the system and
especially the identification part while still maintaining all
services -- financial and communicational -- integrated.

AT&T is one of the companies providing competitive local phone service
here in Rochester, NY.  As you may know, Rochester Telephone (a division
of Frontier Communications) is an independent phone company, not a RBOC.
RochTel came up with an Open Market Plan where "Rochester Telephone" would
have regulated rates, but other companies could buy time on the RochTel
networks and switches to resell as dialtone to consumers.  AT&T is one 
such reseller here.  Time Warner Communications, the local cable co., is
also offering phone service via their fiber-optic CATV distribution network,
which means they don't have to give RochTel money for the network.

Anyhow, a few months ago AT&T was complaining that they were having trouble
competing in Rochester, because it was taking so long for RochTel to 
configure their equipment as necessary to process new customers.  Apparently
AT&T has to ask RochTel to set up each new customer in the switches or
something ... and it means long delays in getting hooked up to AT&T or
if you need repair as an AT&T customer.

Sounds like another case of what goes around, comes around.

Frontier, RochTel's parent company, is partners with Nynex and several other
cellular providers in New York and New England.  In the next few months,
the current company -- RochesterTel Mobile Communications / NYNEX Cellular /
Advantage Cellular / Mountain Cellular -- will become Frontier Cellular
throughout New York State and other markets in the Northeast.

Frontier Communications International, the long distance company, has
been buying up other LD carriers left and right.  Right now, they are
the fifth largest LD carrier, behind AT&T, Sprint, MCI, and LDDS.  (In
my opinion, they also offer far better customer service than most
other LD carriers I've tried, including AT&T.)

Frontier owns local telephone companies in several states throughout the
Northeast and midwestern states, including Frontier Communications of
Minnesota.

While I'm not unhappy with RochTel/Frontier service, I must say that
recently they've been reminding me a bit of a younger, leaner, meaner
AT&T -- a juggernaut.  Since they were never part of Bell, they have
much more of a free hand than the RBOCs and AT&T ... and I wonder if
they don't aim to be the next pre-breakup AT&T.

I wouldn't suggest that anyone looking for an ideal numbering strategy
look at the UK model (except on a what not to do basis!)  The reason
the authorities there are entering a pretent public consultation
process is because they have done so much damage and screwed up so
badly up to now.

There is no long term numbering strategy in the UK - it changes
virtually every year, which is great for the printing industry!  Since
"PhONEday", the UK has enough numbering space for about 8 billion
phone lines, which means that phone numbers are much longer than they
need be, under any population / user terminal growth scenario.  You
can't tell which part of the country an area code is located from the
first digit or two, as one can in virtually every other European
country -- (eg area code 01232 is Belfast, Northern Ireland while 01233
is in Kent in the South East of England).

The UK has several codes for toll-free and similar numbers including
0800, 0500, 0345 and 0645.  In surveys, about 20% of the population
don't know that 0800 is toll free and nearly half the population don't
know that 0500 is toll-free.

Mobile phone numbers, paging, and premium rate numbers are found all
over the numbering space.

Instead of giving London 8 digit local numbers (like Paris and Tokyo),
it now has two area codes, which can mean having to dial 11 digits to
reach someone in a neighboring suburb.

Anyone looking for logical or radical numbering plan ideas should
consider other numbering plans such as found in Switzerland or Ireland
or Denmark or Norway (where they have done away area codes
altogether).

Most European numbering plans have the following characteristics:

*Hierarchical area code structure* (like the US Zip code.  While one
mightn't know where Zip 90234 is precisely, even a non-American can
guess that it is on the West coast and probably in California.
Someone who knows California can probably guess it is in the LA area,
etc.)  This structure follows on to some extent from the country code
layout (eg all country codes beginning with 3 are in Europe).

*Variable number length* so that cities that outgrow 7 digits can have
8 digit local numbers.   No multiple area code confusion.   Small
towns can have even shorter local numbers, if desirable.

*Distinctive non-geographic codes* so that anyone can tell a mobile
number or a pager or a premium rate number from a regular phone number
easily.   

*A single code for a single function* - all toll-free numbers should
begin with the same code to assist public recognition.   So if you run
out of numbering space in the 800 range,  add an extra digit to the
bit that follows 800 - (ie 800 nnnn nnnn).   This goes back to
variable number length flexibility.

A viewpoint from Ontario (Bell Canada country) ...
 
In the National Capital Region (613: Ottawa, Ontario and 819: Hull,
Quebec) there is 7D _local_ dialing across the NPA boundary (also the
Ottawa River, the provincial boundary, and if Quebec separates from
Canada, an international boundary).
 
By contrast, the Greater Toronto Area was recently split (1993) with
Metro Toronto remaining 416 and the outlying region becoming 905.
(This must have used one of the last remaining NZX style area codes).
Local calls across this NPA boundary are dialed 10-digits only;
however there are areas on the outer boundary of 905 where one can
dial 7D local across the NPA boundary to other area codes (519, 705,
613).
 
No local calls are dialed with a 1 in front.

However, all long-distance calls between or within NPAs are dialed as
either 0+ or 1+ ten digits.  (Up to about five years ago it was still
possible to dial 1+ 7D for long-distance within the same NPA. This
ended when the NZX area codes started to run out).

It was not until I started to go to the States, and also talk to US
enployees of the company I work for, that I realised that many people
dial 1+ for local calls.
 
Is this because 'local' service in the States can be metered? All our
local service is flat-rate. Bell got stomped when it recently tried to
introduce metered local service for business.  There was mention of
this on this group not long ago.
 
I suspect the 1+ now tends to signify some kind of metered service,
and as far as the user is concerned, the difference between 'local' or
'long-distance' service becomes more a matter of cost.
 
Incidentally, we do not have the same separation between local and
long-distance carriers also; Bell Canada operates the local monopoly
in its territory, and also competes in the long-distance market. (The
400-kilo gorilla ...)

Subject: Questions: History of AC 905; What's a TWX?
Date: Fri, 25 Aug 1995 04:14:01 GMT
Organization: InterLog Internet Services


I've two questions:

1) Old catalogues at my work give 905 as the area code for northern
Mexico, and 903 as the area code for Mexico City!  905 is now _my_
area code in southern Ontario (outside Toronto).  Mexico is country
code 52 now.

What happened? Did their phone system get rebuilt and centralised? Was
north and central Mexico part of country code 1 once, and then the whole
country was put under country code 52?

2) What is or was a TWX? The same old catalogues give 10-digit TWX
numbers all in what are now area codes N10 (310, 410, 510... ); but
the locations are much more scattered, and don't correspond to the
present area codes.


Scott Robert Dawson  srdawson@interlog.com     
http://www.interlog.com/~srdawson/scothmpg.htm


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Gee, I feel old today. These are both
topics we have covered here in the past, but a brief summary might be
good for people new to the Digest in recent months. Mexico never was
in code 1. They were always 52. But for a number of years, international
direct dialing was in flux here in the USA with some people able to do
it and others not able. For those who were not able to place a call to
Mexico using 011-52, the 903/905 hack was available. These were two
previously unused area codes which were set up to call Mexico. They were
never actually known by those numbers; instead the official rule was 
that one could call Mexico by dialing '90' followed by '3' and the local
number in many towns in northern Mexico or '5' followed by the loal
number in Mexico City. Once IDDD was universal throughout the USA, there
was no longer a need for 90-3 or 90-5 and they were retired from service
pending assignment as regular area codes elsewhere.

What is TWX, the man asks. Well, the <T>ype<W>riter E<X>change was AT&T's
competition to Western Union's Telex, or <TEL>egraph <EX>change. Earlier
in this century, Western Union had expanded their telegraph services to
include a 'do it yourself' network where telegrams (essentially messages
typed out on paper transmitted long distances over wires) no longer had
to be sent from a public telegram office. Businesses could lease a telegraph
sending/receiving machine and do it themselves in their offices via a
switched network Western Union constructed, in large part with the help
of their very good freind, AT&T.  After awhile, AT&T thought that Telex
looked like a very profitable thing, so they decided to do it themselves.
They had to call it a different name of course, so they chose TWX, which
is pronounced 'Twix'. They were also just getting into area codes about 
the same time, so they reserved area codes 310,410,510,610,710,810 and 910
for TWX machines. Where 310,410,510 and 710 covered the eastern part of the
USA, 910 covered the entire western part of the USA from Chicago westward. 
610 was Canadian TWX and 810 was Mexican TWX, although I never once saw a
single example of 810 back in those days. 

One day Western Union got in a snit about the success of AT&T's TWX network
and filed suit to force AT&T out of that business. Their claim was that
they (WUTCO) had the exclusive rights to written communication by wire just
as AT&T had the exclusive right to verbal communication by wire. Remember,
this was *long* before divestiture; I guess it was in the early to middle
1960's. AT&T lost the case and the Supreme Court ordered them to divest
themselves of TWX. 'Conveniently', WUTCO was more than happy to purchase it.
The purchase was made 'in place' with the switching equipment, etc, remaining
in AT&T (really local telco) central offices, but belonging to WUTCO. The
'area codes' assigned for TWX use went along with it, and for about twenty
years or longer, WUTCO operated two separate and distinct networks, their
original Telex network and their TWX network, with Telex network switches
and equipment in their custody and maintained by them and TWX network
switches and equipment owned by them but maintained by the various local
Bell System telcos under contract. Is that all clear as mud now?  <grin>. 

A number of years ago WUTCO decided to change the name of the service from
TWX to 'Telex II'. Then they started 'Easy Link' with a gateway into both
Telex and Telex II from Easy Link. Easy Link subscribers got email, and
those who wanted an address for the receipt of telegrams were assigned
network addresses in the 910 'area code' regardless of where they were. 
Then AT&T eventually bought the whole thing back from WUTCO, and I guess
all the Telex II (TWX) machines were moved over onto the original Telex
network and all the reserved area codes were put back into service for
voice telephony. Honestly, I have no idea these days who -- if anyone --
operates and maintains the Telex network, if it even still exists. Does
AT&T still operate it domestically in the USA?  I know that the company
known as 'Western Union International' which was never part of Western
Union, is owned by MCI, or at least it was.  Anyone have updated stuff
on this?   PAT]

Do they read the ANI to you?  If they do, we now have another way

You're fortunate that they found it. It took me over eight months to
convince Nynex that they made the exact same mistake on my line. I'd
call them FROM the line through an operator and have the operator read
back the number to customer service. The nice lady on the other end of
the phone would always come back with "I have no record that the
number exists." to the amusement of both myself and the operator. They
never did find all my toll charges but I know where they went. Seems
that the local VA hospital is on the same exchange as me but their
numbers are xxx-71xx where mine is xxx-071x ... so it's obvious that
someone shifted a digit. I found out because in years of old I used
to, well, know my way around other carrier's networks and a friend in
NJ called me and asked if I was up to old tricks again. I got a bill
for eight months of flat rate local service -- which came to a grand
total of $160 because even the end-user charges weren't added in.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It would happen a lot that if the subscriber
was on the same premises as some major account (for instance, a switchboard
serving most of a large building) that the installer who came to do the work
'just assumed' without reading the order carefully that the new install was
part of the larger customer's account, and they would turn the service on
but not submit the paperwork correctly. Likewise, a major organization or
institution occupies most -- but not all -- of an exchange with a centrex
account and then here and there a few independent subscribers are stuck
in on the same exchange ... the centrex admin had better watch out, because
someone processing the paperwork says 'oh, exchange xxx, that is all used
by the Universal Amalgamated Corporation,' and just toss the new charges
on their bill.  PAT]

Subject: Smartcard Phone Spotted in Oshawa Ontario!
Date: Fri, 25 Aug 1995 00:04:26 GMT
Organization: InterLog Internet Services


Last week I was in Oshawa visiting friends and we stopped at a food
store. The pay phones in the lobby were the standard Nortel 'Millennium' 
model, but the top housing above the screen was bright blue with the
new Bell logo, and the card reader housing was bright yellow. Both of
these were changed from the previous grey-blue.  The graphic by the
card slot showed two cards, one with a stripe and one with a small
square.

Intrigued, I remembered them and turned to the Web when I got home.
Earlier, I had seen an ad in French for a new Bell phone card with a
chip, in a promotional magazine for the Montreal Jazz Festival. Bell
Canada serves most of Ontario and part of Quebec.

A check of Bell's Web site, http://www.bell.ca, turned up a media
release dated 7 April, which described the new card and its rollout
across Quebec and (in September) Ontario. The card was supposed to be
easily buyable in convenience stores, depanneurs, etc.
 
My question is: are these cards reusable? Can you put more money in
them when they run out? Will they be refillable in an ATM? Is there
some sort of standard for these cards so that they could be used, say,
in other countries? Will other countries' cards work in a Bell phone?
All this hints at a vast behind-the-scenes transaction network
rivaling the banks'.

Today (Aug. 22) the {Baltimore Sun} had a reprint of an {L.A. Times}
article "800 numbers have the ring of success" by Roy Rivenburg.
There is no hint of area code 888 or the rumbles involving it, but it
does note that 800 numbers are relatively new with regard to consumer
affairs (the phones replace at least some of the mail).  Also, it
says:

"The granddaddy of toll-free product numbers emerged at Whirlpool,
which christened its 'Cool Line" in 1967, the year AT&T introduced 800
service."

NYNEX is already allowing calls to Connecticut's new 860 NPA, two
weeks before permissive dialing is scheduled to start.  I can call 860
from my office in 617-254 (Brighton MA), although not through the
office PBX, which does not yet recognize 860.

SNET's announced test number, 860-203-0950, is not yet operational.

I'd be interested to know whether other areas are getting early
access to 860.

BTW, on a trip to New Jersey the last weekend of July, I passed a
glass-company truck on the highway that had already been altered to
show (860) instead of (203) ... and this a full month before permissive
dialing started!  Glad to see the message is getting through to some
people.

I was reading in TELECOM Digest recently that plans are being made to
allow any of the various small countries and territories in area code
809 to get its own area code.  The first of these is Bermuda, area
code 441, going into effect later this year.

Under the current system, directory assistance for all of 809 is
centralized (I think somewhere in Florida) -- you reach the same
operator for Bermuda, Puerto Rico, or Jamaica.  However, if each of
those has its own area code, they could decide independently whether
to continue contracting with the folks in Florida (or wherever) or to
set up their own operation.  Conceivably they could even try to set
different charges for access to their directory assistance.

Ironically, if every different country got its own area code, it would
simplify the determination of rates: only the area code would be
needed to figure the cost of a call, instead of the area code and
prefix.

Just one of those little bits of technotrivia that preoccupy me when I
really should be asleep.

Interesting, indeed. Taking this argument to its logical extreme, since
now there are no restrictions as to who can be in whose market, it is
possible that using Ted Vail's old tactics AT&T might end up buying
USWest, PacTel, SWBT, Nynex, BellAtlantic, BellSouth, Ameritech, and GTE,
and we will be back to square one.


S. Bapat   bapat@gate.net


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: No, I don't think they could buy up those
companies. I think all those former AT&T companies have to be left alone
where AT&T is concerned. That is what I meant by saying 'several monopolies'.
Today, a hundred years after the government-ordered breakup of the Standard
Oil Trust owned by John Rockefeller, any of the various parts of the former
oil monopoly (Exxon, Amoco, Chevron, etc) are by themselves larger than the
original monopoly. Competition, eh?  So let's open a gasoline refinery and
oil producing business and see how far it gets us ... Within the next dozen
years or so watch and see if each of the Baby Bells are just as powerful
and sassy as AT&T ever was in the old days if not more so. No one today
remembers when Exxon, Chevron and Amoco were all one and the same; and
I venture to say in a few years very few Americans around will still
remember when there was a single 'telephone company'. Instead there will
be a half-dozen or so large, major players in the industry, each a complete
full service phone company with long distance service, local service and
everything else they offer. So instead of one monopoly to 'choose from'
we will have six to choose from. Still, I guess that's better than just
one.   PAT]

This brings to mind a terrifying episode that occurred when my wife
was about to give birth to our daughter.  We were in a public building
at the time my wife realized that the baby's movements were very
diminished, which indicates that the baby could be dying.  We called
the OB/GYN from a payphone and the answering service wanted our number
for a return call.  I read the fine print on the phone which said "no
incoming calls accepted".  The service refused to give us the OB/GYN's
home number.  We panicked for a short time until I realized we had our
brand new cell phone in the car which we were able to receive the OB's
calls on.

Subject: Mexico and TWX (was History of 905, etc)
Date: Fri, 25 Aug 95 09:58:00 +6C


PAT,

PLEASE, PLEASE lets get the history of Mexico and TWX correct -

Only yesterday I was looking thru the TD ftp archives of older back issues 
and found some replies dated 18 Jan 1989 regarding TWX and 'supplementary' 
Area Codes postings in the Guide to N.America/Area Codes.

FIRST, MEXICO.

Mexico had been developing its OWN internal automated network probably
in the 1950's, but most likely during the 1960's. The EXTREME Mexican
northwest border with the US (California, Arizona, New Mexico),
covering about a dozon or so border towns in the Mexican states of
Baja California (N), Sonora, and Chihuahua were 'assigned' a special
Area Code of 903 (not 905) circa 1962 or 63. Whether they were readily
dialable or not in 62/63 I don't know. I was unaware of 903 for NW
Mexico until the early 1970's when researching out-of-town telephone
directories at the Public Library. The New Orleans directory did NOT
list 903, 808, 907, or 809 (or 905) until around the mid 1970's. 

903 was ALSO used as a 'billing-identification' or 'mark-sense' code
for 'all' of rural (non-dial, local manual) Mexico as well. Automated
Mexico (within +52) was also operator dialable from US/Canada using
routing code 180+the eight digit Mexican National number, and became
customer dialable (if you had IDDD) as 011+52+the eight digit Mexican
National Number around 1979 or 80. Northwest Mexican 903 border towns
'seem' to have had a NNX-XXXX number, as I have seen such in various
travel/tourist/hotel guides from back in the 1960's and 70's, and I
even remember seeing 903 as the (N.American) areacode for such towns
as Ensenada, Tijuanna, Rosarito, etc. in *other* countries' telephone
books. While 903 was in use in the 1970's (and 60's), those border
towns were NOT listed in the Mexico City directory as dialable towns
using Mexico's internal automated dial toll network (+52).

In 1970, Mexico City became dialable from many points in US/Canada
using 90-5. Mexico City's +52 city code is a single digit, 5. Their
local numbers are seven digits long. This makes up an eight digit
Mexican National numbers. Some towns (dialable, too) on the outskirts
of Mexico City had *five-digit* local numbers, and a Mexican (dialable) 
city code of *three* digits, beginning with 5. Any Mexican (dialable)
city code starting with '5' could be dialed from (most/many) US/Canadian 
points as (1+/0+) 90+ the eight digit Mexican National Number IF it
began with a '5'.

In 1980, AT&T Long-Lines and Telefonos de Mexico re-arranged the Mexican 
border towns in '903'. They were re-numbered and re-routed to conform with 
Mexico's internal numbering scheme, and were assigned city codes beginning 
with '6'. Mexico's zone 6 covered a LARGE chunk of northwest Mexico, but 
prior to 1980 did not include those dozon or so border towns. In 1980, it 
did. I haven't had a chance to compare pre-1980 with post-1980 Tijuana 
directories, but its pre-1980 numbers of 903-NNX-XXXX were changed to (+52) 
66 + a six digit local number. I don't know how the 'central-office' codes 
were changed, other than that they were 'shortened'. You could reach ALL of 
Mexican Zone 6 points now (from US/Canada) with (1+/0+) 70+ the eight digit 
Mexican National Number IF it began with a '6'.

ANYONE in the US/Canada could use 90-5 and 70-6, although AT&T promoted the 
IDDD method (011/01+52+eight digits) and ONLY publicized the 1+/0+  70-6 & 
90-5 for those who did NOT have IDDD, altho' even IDDD capable customers 
COULD use them as well.

By 1991, Bellcore 'reclaimed' 90-5 and 70-6, and insisted on IDDD access 
*only* as they reassigned 905 to the 416 Ontario split which took place in 
1993, and 706 to the 404 Georgia split which took place in 1992. 903 had 
been reclaimed in 1980, and was reassigned to the 214 Texas split in 1990.

NOW for TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange service)

AT&T began its TWX network as far back as *1931* as a MANUALLY
connected teletype service. It was NOT an integrated part of the
telephone network, and had its OWN numbering scheme. It only served
the continental US. In the mid 1950's, CNCP (now Unitel) began
automated telex service in Canada. By 1958, Western Union began an
automated telex network in the US. Mexico as well had a telex service
by the late 50's or early 60's. All of these networks, including AT&T
TWX used 5-level punch tape Baudot code, at a speed of roughly 60 to
66 baud.

AT&T's TWX was still manual by 1960, but traffic was growing and
connection set up times were getting longer. In 1962, AT&T did a
splash cut of TWX from manual to automated. There is an article in a
1962 issue of 'Bell Laboratories Record' magazine describing this.
MOST TWX terminals were retrofitted with an attatchment consisting of
a modem, '6-line-keyset', rotary-dial, and a 'half-a-handset'. The
half-a-handset was like a 500 telephone set's handset cut in half with
only an earpiece on it. Some of the oldest teletype TWX machines had
an actual 500-desk-set with the 6-keys hooked up to it. In those, the
transmitter insert was either removed or it was disconnected. The
6-keys were not actually lines, but controls. One was for originate,
one was for (attendant) answer (altho' later machines had an
auto-answer capability), one was for clearing or releasing the
connection, another for testing, and another for 'local' or more
specifically offline typing or tape-punching. I don't know what the
other key was used for right now. ALL TWX customers were assigned
'telephone' numbers, using their OWN GEOGRAPHIC telephone areacode,
and a 'centrally' located NNX code, which was usually that of a
#5Crossbar office in that city or in the larger town nearby. TWX
machines could DIAL telephone numbers, but couldn't talk to them, and
telephones could DIAL to TWX machines!!! All of these TWX machines had
three rows on the keyboard, and still used 5-level-Baudot code, just
like the telex machines in telegraphy.

About a year after AT&T had automated their TWX network by *integrating* 
it with the DDD Telephone network, they announced that there would be
a *new* TWX service, using 8-level-ASCII code, faster speeds, and
4-row keyboards (Model 33 & 35 teletype machines). They reserved FIVE
special areacodes for this service: 510, 610, 710, 810, 910. Please
note: 210, 310, 410 were NOT used for TWX- 410 was used in many parts
of the country for reaching telephone Repair Service, while all three
were used in some areas for various testing purposes such as ANAC
(Auto reading back of your telephone number) or Ring-Back.

Pat, please note the geography of the TWX N10's in the 1960's:

610 TWX Canada

710 TWX US (Northeast - states now serviced by NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, 
So.NewEnglandTel)

810 TWX US (Midwest/Southeast - states now serviced by Bell South, 
Cincinnati Bell, Ameritech- Michigan, Ohio, Indiana EXCEPT the NW corner 
near Chicago)

910 TWX US (Midwest, West of Mississippi River- states now serviced by US 
West, SW Bell, Pac*Bell/Nevada*Bell, and the remainder of Ameritech- 
Wisconsin, Illinois, northwest corner of Indiana near Chicago)

510 TWX US (smaller towns ALL OVER the US, which were not near a #5XB office 
at the time)

710, 810, 910 were part of the 'TWX Switching Plan' (TWX-SP)
610 (Canada) was not initially part of the TWX-SP
510 was NOT part of the TWX-SP

The Independents worked closely with AT&T Long-Lines to provide TWX as well.

TWX was routed over the DDD Telephone network, but for the most part, 
regular telephone NPA's could NOT dial to a N10-NNX TWX machine, but a 3-row 
5-level TWX machine with its own telephone NPA could. N10 TWX machines could 
dial ANY telephone NPA, including telephone numbers. Model 33 & 35 TWX 
teletypes had a built in 6-key control set, dial or touchtone pad, and a 
speaker instead of a handset earpiece.

This is the 'snit' that Western Union got into. They brought
complaints against AT&T for this newer and faster TWX service, stating
that AT&T shouldn't be involved in telegraphy! By 1970, after
legal/court/FCC hearings and investigations, AT&T agreed to 'sell' its
TWX (ALL of it) over to WUTC.  Canada was NOT involved in this. TWX in
the US thus became the 'marketing domain' of WUTC.

For the next ten or so years, TWX was *still* numbered, dialed,
routed, switched over the Bell System's DDD Telephone network
*as-if-it-were* an integral part of the Bell System. WUTC 'sold' the
service, billed the customers, repaired the terminals, and leased
loops and trunks (and the switching capability) from AT&T, Bell, and
the independents. Canadian TWX was always the part of the telephone
companies themselves up in Canada.  3-row slower speed TWX machines in
the US (using their geographic telephone NPA codes) were declining
thru the 70's, and by 1979 were discontinued altogather. Throughout
the 1970's, WUTC and AT&T were planning for WU to do its OWN
routing/switching of TWX (US ONLY). By 1982, WU completed the
'removal' of TWX from the DDD telephone network (US only). Within a
year or two, there was no need for geographic meanings of the N10
codes, so WU began assigning numbers ANYWHERE from ANY N10 (510, 710,
810, 910). There was also no more need for geographic meaning to the
NNX's within any N10, and WU also began to assign 'central office'
codes of the form N0X, N1X, and even 0XX and 1XX! (I have TWX/Telex
directories from 1978, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1989/90, and 1991).

As far as AT&T (and later Bellcore) were concerned, the N10's were now 
reclaimed, except for 610 Canada. The VERY FIRST N10 to be re-assigned was 
710, to the US Federal Government for some still unspecified private 
service. It was assigned sometime around 1983 or 84. I was not aware of its 
use until I saw it in a Bellcore LERG in 1990 in a list of NPA codes.

In the meantime, WU had plans for the other N10's on TWX -- the only
one I ever saw being used was 310. It was a special access prefix to
be used for TWX customers to directly dial US Telex terminals (WU and
the other IRC Domestic US Telex networks) without having to go thru
WU's 'Infomaster' store-and-forward setup computer. 210 was 'supposed'
to be used for WU US TWX to dial direct to CNCP/Unitel's Canadian
Telex, and 410 was to be used for WU US TWX to dial direct to Mexico's
Telex (BTW, Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska, Caribbean never had TWX as such;
only Telex, altho' they have had telephone numbers for Data and Fax, of
course). I saw references to plans for 210+ & 410+ but never saw any
actual instructions in WU's TWX/Telex directories as such, only actual
references to 310+.

The other N10 codes for TELEPHONE purposes have been 'reassigned' as such:
510 to the 415 California split, 1991
410 to the 301 Maryland split, 1991
310 to the 213 California split, 1991
210 to the 512 Texas split, 1992
910 to the 919 North Carolina split, 1993
810 to the 313 Michigan split, 1993
610 to the 215 Pennsylvania split, 1994

Canadian 610 TWX had been on the decline in the 1980's, and incidently never 
did reach the popularity of CNCP/Unitel's Telex service. The local telephone 
companies of Telecom-Canada (now Stentor) began to introduce ISDN and Data 
services on non-TWX central office NNX codes of the 610 NPA thru-out the 
1980's. By 1993, when Bellcore needed to use 610 for telephone purposes, 
Canada and Bellcore agreed to 'splash-cut' all remaining TWX machines and new 
data services on 610 over to the new 600 special areacode. According to 
ITU-T (CCITT), the 'international telex country code' for Canadian TWX has 
been discontinued since Stentor Canada discontinued TWX altogather in 1984. 
The Data services on 600 have their own ITU-T (CCITT) Data network country 
codes, tho'. And, the 600-NXX codes used in Canada are being assigned to 
'carriers' similar to the way 900-NXX & 500-NXX codes are being assigned 
today, and the way 800-NXX codes were assigned before 'portability' 
(1985-1993 timeframe).

Western Union began its EasyLink email type of service in the early to
mid 1980's using its own numbering scheme. By 1990, AT&T purchased all
of TWX (WU began calling it 'Telex-II), Telex-I, and EasyLink from
WUTC. I have the AT&T directory from 1991 and was told last year
(1994) that it is the most recent directory available. AT&T continued
to have 'EasyLink' numbers and network, Telex-I, and Telex-II (known
again as TWX), and ALL using the numbering schemes still used by WUTC.
TWX still used N10's (510, 710, 810, 910), but there was no geography
to the N10's, nor to the 'central office' code portions, now NNX, NXX,
0XX and 1XX, but AT&T had this as a PRIVATE NETWORK SERVICE, not an
*integral* part of the AT&T *telephone* long-distance network as it
had back in the 60's, and even 70's. I don't know how thin an AT&T
message services directory would be if one were printed today. With
email, Internet, Fax machines, and other dedicated data networks,
traditional/nostalgic TWX & Telex in the US and Canada have continued
to shrink.

AND, I have been TRYING to compile a numerical listing and assignments
of the OLD TWX N10-NNX codes- If ANYONE has an old listing (with
assignments to cities & states/provinces) down to the central office
NNX code level of the OLD (circa 1960's/70's) TWX 510, 610, 710, 810,
910, I would appreciate it VERY much if you could email, mail, or fax
me a copy. Thanks in advance!

        I've actually had one of these cards for a couple of months
now.  I participated in Bell's contest at their web site
(http://www.bell.ca) and they sent me one with $10 on it.  It seems to
mimic using cash.  That is, local calls are $0.25 and long distance
calls are direct-dialled rates plus the operator-surcharge of around
$2 (the same as if you used cash).  The long distance surcharge goes
against what the pamphlet said, the surcharge was only supposed to be
$1.  That might be because they're really not in use here yet.  The
card looks like a regular phone-card except that it has no numbers on
it (i.e. card number), and a nice picture of "Chute aux Rats,
Mont-Tremblant" (a water fall).

        Well from what I gathered they contain a small microchip in
them that stores how much money you have in them.  I doubt that they
could be used in a bank machine as they don't rely on a magnetic
strip.  That's why Bell are changing over the Millennium pay-phones to
the yellow readers.  However, they should be reusable but I don't
really know.  The value of the card is printed in the upper-right hand
corner.  This might indicate that it is not reusable, or at least can
only hold $10.

        The prime locations for these new phones seems to be Colleges
and Universities.  I've also seen the occasional one popping up in other
locations, but they seem to be concentrating their initial targets at
students.

        They're very convenient for local calls but the high-surcharge
for long distance would make me want to swipe my calling-card instead.
If they brought the surcharge down to the same level as the
calling-card ($0.75) it would be a pretty good deal.  However, with
the new card the phone tells you exactly how much the call will cost
(initial charge and additional minute for long distance or 25 cents
for local).  I find this very convenient, it also gives you a timed
countdown (minutes & seconds) of how much longer you have on the card
for the current long distance call.  I find it very nice to know
*exactly* how much the call is going to cost when I make it!

My own comments:

As I noted before with regard to overlays vs. splits, Americans
believe that once they've learned something, then it must ALWAYS be
true.  This also applies to the meaning of 1+ and the meaning of
"toll".

The reason 1+ means "toll" in SOME places is historical: With
step-by-step switches, dialing 1 immediately cut through to a toll
trunk, and a toll switch ate the rest of the digits directly.  The 1
was literally an access code for a different switch, one which had
call detail billing.  Local calls never had detail billing, and never
hit the toll switch.

In areas that used mostly crossbar and/or panel (which did NOT cleanly
interwork with step, so panel and step were geographically isolated),
the crossbar ate the first 3 digits, and routed the call accordingly.
So there was no need for 1+.  These areas generally did not use 1+ for
toll.  New Jersey, New York, and San Francisco were examples.  I grew
up in New Jersey where 1+ meant "your finger slipped on the hookswitch, 
but the CO knows better than to interrupt dial tone because of it".

7-digit dialing between area codes requires one of two solutions.  One
is to make intra-NPA toll REQUIRE dialing 1+10d.  But it's counterintuitive 
to get a different NPA by omitting your own.  So even where NYNEX (in
MA) was ordered by the state to use 1+10d for intra-NPA toll, they
don't allow 7d inter-NPA.  Besides, this fails if the same prefix is
local in both NPAs.  For 617, where 90% of prefices are "local" to
each other, this couldn't work for calls to 508.  Thus it's 1+10d.

The other solution is "code protection", where near-border NXX codes
aren't assigned in both NPAs.  This wastes codes, and can no longer be
afforded in most NPAs.  (Still okay in a few, but bad form.)  That was
the original way in some places, especially places like NJ where there
was never 1+ dialing.

Of course in some cases, "local" costs less than "toll" (Boston local
zone 2, 9-16 miels, during weekends costs 5.5c/min, vs. 3.6c for the
longest intra-LATA toll call), so the 1+ rule is less useful than it
sounds.

AT&T Bought Cross Country Cable last month. Come January 1,1996 they will 
be able to offer dial tone to all of these subscribers and bypass the LEC.
Right now this company offers toll bypass for large companies.

Please remember that 1-800-692-6447 (MY ANI IS) will quote back the
telephone number of your line OR TRUNK-line that the call is being
placed out on.

Most PBX and Cellular systems do NOT pass out the seven/ten digit
number of the actual PBX extension or Cellular unit. The particular
outgoing trunk-line IS identified and that is what is being quoted
back on 800-MY-ANI-IS or a local telco C/O ANAC-out code. Most PBX and
Cellular systems I have run across also don't pass out the actual
extension or cellphone number to a Caller-ID box.

Our PBX here at work will have the outgoing trunklines' numbers show
up on a caller-ID box on outgoing local calls (or quoted out on the
800 'ANI' number). BellSouth Mobility calls show up as 'Out-Of-Area'
at the called party's Caller-ID box. 800-MY-ANI-IS will quote back the
'same' trunkline number of BSM New Orleans (I don't remember exactly
what it is right now, but it is always the same 504-45x-xxxx). My
actual cellular number is 504-460-xxxx, New Orleans ratecenter, for
BSMobility Cellular, and MOST 46X's in 504 are not New Orleans, but
the Kenner LA (suburb of New Orleans) rate center. 

(BTW, 504-460 is 'new', comming on line in April '95; MOST one-armed
bandit slot-machine damnable COCOT private payphone pieces of CRAP
here don't have 460 programmed in as a local NNX code- they either
claim invalid number or 'default' it to a NPA 504 TOLL nnx code,
requesting something like $3.00 a minute!!!!!) When I go to
Mississippi Gulf Coast (Cellular South) or points just south of New
Orleans such as Houma, Thibadeaux, Plaq.Parish, Lafitte, etc.
(MobilTel), I get an entirely DIFFERENT number when I 800-MY-ANI-IS,
which is the trunkline being used by that cellular service. If I roam
to Baton Rouge LA (another BellSouth Mobility cellular service area),
I would get a Baton Rouge area number if I'd 800-MY-ANI-IS, the
outgoing trunkline for that area.

As for determining the actual number of a PBX extension, I would guess
that each PBX manufacturer has some time of ANAC code for the PBX
ext's. Maybe you could call the PBX operator or administration for
assistance in that matter.  Many PBX systems do have internal PBX
Caller-ID, so call up another extension you know has a displayphone or
box, or maybe dial the PBX '0' Operator! There ARE some PBX to Public
Telco interfaces which DO identify the number of the extension, but I
haven't run across any myself. Centrex systems for the most part DO
give the actual telephone number, however, since Centrex is USUALLY a
TELCO public central office switch based large-business system instead
of a PBX on a customer's premesis.

Don't forget the payphones installed in Las Vegas casinos, which are
rigged to keep your quarter even if your call doesn't go through. At

Agreed, but they now *seem* to be trying to correct for that.  OFTEL
took over the numbering plan only last year, from BT.  A large part of
the problem seems to have been inherited from the fact that a country
so relatively small was divided into so many 'area' codes:

"The present geographic scheme - now using 01 numbers - was designed
by the Post Office in the 1950s and is based around 638 areas, each of
which has a code. With the exception of London and some other major
cities, all these areas are of similar size."

This gives the potential of 800 000 numbers for some small towns of a
few hundred people.

The article is very critical of this, and suggests that an "02" series
of *much larger* area codes be overlaid on the current "01" series, with
only 020-029 used.  Presumably, these would be few enough for people to
remember their geographical relationship.  *BOTH* the 01 and the 02 area
codes could be used permissively.

Also, "numbers beginning 04 can in future be used for mobile services;
07 for Personal Numbering services; and 08 for special services such as
freephone, services charging national calls at local rate and some
information services."

While I respect your views and agree with many of your observations
(mostly the ones I deleted without comment), I suspect that you haven't
really read the article thoroughly.

This is not different from North America.  And unlike the NANP, where
area codes were assigned pretty much at random, the UK codes started
out as alphabetics related to the place name.  So 01232 (then 0232)
was originally 0BE2 - BE for Belfast, while 0234 was 0BE4 for Bedford,
0484 was GUildford, and so on.  This broke down after a while, and
there was never any way of guessing what the 4th digit would be, but
it is the basis for those numbers.

The French system is nothing like this.  The Departement numbers
are scattered randomly around the country, so you can't tell where
a number is unless you have memorized the list.

This is terrible idea, for the one simple reason that telephones don't
have Enter keys.  So the switch has to decide when you've finished
dialing by some means, usually a timeout.  Or if the switch is smart
enough it may be able to avoid timeouts on certain calls, but the
result is inconsistent behaviour.

The NANP has this for 900 and such, though there are some local
variations (976 and the like are not universal).  There is no need to
know that yo are calling a mobile number if the mobile user is paying,
Indeed many people would consider it a privacy violation for the phone
company to tell all their callers what kind of service they have by
assigning special numbers to mobiles.


Tony Harminc


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Actually, telephones do have 'enter' keys
or 'carriage return' keys. It is the '#' key located underneath the '9'.
Sometimes known as the Octothorpe, the signal from this key is generally
understood to mean the end of the dialing string has occurred. For 
example, try dialing just 0 for the operator, then 0# for the operator
and note how much faster the latter connects, since no time-out is needed.
Likewise try calling the number to which your calling card is assigned
(which allows entry of just the calling card pin rather than the whole
number) and after entering the four digit pin then do nothing ... it will
time out eventually and process your call. Do it again adding # after the
four digit pin and note the difference. 

If some specified number of digits are expected and required, then the use
of # will not affect the timing one way or the other. For example punching
in the seven digits of a local call followed by # has no affect whatsoever.
A non-working two or three digit combination followed by # will have no
affect whatsoever; that is the network will continue waiting patiently for
more input from you. But if some two digit combination (for example 72 ro
call forward or 67 to suspend transmission of caller ID) is presented and
these can also serve as the first two digits of some longer combination,
then adding # will make a difference, and the network will go right to work
on what (two digits or other less than 7/11 combination) you have entered.
So why don't we have telephone numbers of any length with the understanding
that when the subscriber has finished giving the instructions, a # is used
to indicate conclusion. The network would then process what had been given
in the proper context.   PAT]

Reading Mark Cuccia's interesting and informative history of the
Mexican hacks and TWX, this reminded me of something I read in Carl
Moore's history.of.area.splits in the Telecom Archives a while back 
dealing with the introduction of area code 318 in 1951, which I'm 
interested in finding out more about. Carl writes:

Furthermore, in 1959, according to Carl Moore's file, 415 did a
*three-way split* with West Central California moving to 408 and North
West California moving to 707, with the San Francisco Area retaining
415 (which, as we know, later split again to form 415/510).

So, do any historians out there know anything more about these DDD
trials, specifically why a new NPA was allocated, and then reclaimed
several years later. Also, was it a full cutover, or simply some kind
of optional 'overlay' where either 318 or 415 could be used to reach
San Francisco? If San Francisco was still in 318 for some time after
1951, why then did it return to 415, which was obviously nearing
capacity, as it split three ways a few years later?

Finally, are there any other known cases such as this, where an area
code is split and is later reclaimed, or changed back to the former
code or somehow reshuffled (apart from another split or overlay)?

Incidentally, the above three-way split of 415 in 1959 seems to indicate 
that the current three-way split planned for Chicago cannot claim to
be the first, especially since the Chicago split/reorganization is
being implemented over about two years, and not all at once. (I don't
think anyone actually claimed that it *was* the first, just that that
it was the only one that anybody could think of!)

900 information providers are required, under current law, to voice a
`disclaimer announcement' during the initial 24 seconds after answering.  
This announcement must state the name of the information provider, and
the price of the call (stated as a per-call amount, or a per-minute
amount, as appropriate).  The announcement must then state that the
caller may disconnect NOW to avoid charges.  This announcement
normally ends with a beep signifying the beginning of the chargeable
call.  If the caller disconnects before the beep, no charge is made.
The information provider generally pays the long distance carrier for
these calls.

For telecom resellers, PBX administrators, COCOT-owners and such,
there is generally no other option than to completely block calls to
900, 976, and now, 500 numbers.  If credit-card billing is accepted to
these numbers, then 0+ calls to such numbers may be allowed if
billed-number screening is also effective.

No, you can get ANI without taking any action.  Here's the sequence:

        1-800-4BLOCKME
        wait through first message (cannot be interrupted)
        as soon as the menu starts: 3 2 (you can do these fast together)
        "As a courtesy, your local...  xxx-xxx-xxxx"
        *if you press "1" here, you get blocked, "2" you don't.  Just hang up.

Thank you, Integretel, for giving us ANI from an 800 call, even if it takes
a minute and we have to hear your name four times. :-)

It was mentioned in a previous article that Integretel (a misnomer
if you ask me), has 800-425-6256 (800-4BLOCKME) available to block 
any adult services calls that may be billed by them.

American Telnet, another company of this type also has one. That
number is 800-204-2569. This number must also be dialed from the
number that you wish blocked. Their Customer Service number is
800-460-0307.

I don't know if these numbers will block 500 calls however.

I will post more as they become available.

Hughes Network Systems has such a beast for sale, called DirectPC.  It
provides up to 400Kbps commited rate, but I think it can burst up to 3
Mbps.  14.4K POTS link is available for outgoing traffic.  I'm not
sure if there are plans to add more user data bandwidth.  I think
price is between $1/2K per terminal.  I think they sell the Internet
connectivity package under the title of "Turbo Internet".

So it is technically feasible.  Not sure about the market.

This question (albeit a good one) appears often enough that it might
deserve it's own place in the FAQ {hint, hint}.

I can provide the equation used to compute miles, given two V&H
numbers.  It is in most IXC and/or intra-lata tariffs, mine is circa
1984.

I realize this is not what you want, unless you happen to have the
exact longitude and latitude of one end.  Even with that you only get
a distance, but no vector.  And let's don't even consider whether or
not the equation covers the Earth's curvature.

There is a program, called NPA, which will do what you want.

To get all the goodies, you must register it.  The unregistered
version is not exactly crippled, but it *will not* give you what you
want.

Here is the info on the latest version:

NPA for WINDOWS <04Jul95> - Comprehensive area code (NPA), prefix
(NXX), and city name locator.  Contains 90,000,000 ZipCode to NXX
mappings ranked by frequency of occurrence, county name, estimated
county population, lat/long for each NXX for inter-city or inter-NXX
mileage calculation, NXX use type (landline/cellular), city time zone,
and more for over 20,000 cities in the USA & Canada.  Nearly 60,000
NPA/NXXs in all!  All fields except lat/long & county population are
key searchable!  Tie US ZipCodes & Canadian Postal Codes to NPA/NXXs.
Print, file output, and Optional Data Export.  Most complete area code
program you've ever seen!

I tried to find an contact number for the author, but this is a
WINDOZE program, and everything but the file description is in the
form of a Windows .hlp file.

He also has a DOS version.

The author goes by the name of PC Consultant, and is located in
Houston.

This is an excellent program.  I have been using the DOS version for a
couple of years.

E-Mail me if you need contact info, although I think Pat may have it
at hand).

The V&H system was invented by Bellcore (O.K. Bell Labs at the time
but the current organization is Bellcore. This is an attempt to turn
the U.S which is a curved area on a sphere into a flat plane with the
least amount of overall error when doing distance calculations. Works
reasonably well.  Each V or H represents .1 miles so

   distance = sqrt((V.Orig - V.Dest) ^ 2 + (H.Orig - H.Dest) ^ 2 ) / 10

Some locales have special rules if the result is a small number but
99% of the time, the above formula gets the right answer. Serious
errors crop up when using this for locations at the fringe, (i.e. AK
to HI).

The code to convert V&H to K&L (Latitude/Longitude) is interesting (I
did this for a company I used to work for). If you are willing to buy
the code, call Lynn-Arthur Associates in Ann Arbor and see what the
license fee is. Sorry but I did that work for them and cannot share
the results.  To reproduce it, you would need access to the original
formulas from Bellcore for converting K&L into V&H and be good at
writing algorithms backwards. Be warned, I had to do some iterative
loops to approximate the answer and this is harder than it looks as
you are doing things in two dimensions.


Have fun.

Attached is a C program that will do what you want. I don't know
anything more than what is here. I think it was posted in a news

fine.

Going the other way is a bit more complicated. Probably the simplest
way is by successive approximation.

Good Luck.

concepts are covered without going overboard.  Many books mention RFCs

get them (and which ones to get) in as simple and useful a form.  The
definition of client/server isn't accurate (it doesn't work for X, for
example), but is good enough to be getting on with.
 
IBM wants, of course, to promote its own Internet Connection Service
as the Internet provider of choice, and the setup to ICS is the
simpler of the two.  They may, however, have taken simplicity a bit
too far.  If the book is correct, there is no provision for a modem
initialization string.  The directions for the use of other access
providers is quite clear, but it states that the IP address assigned
to the user is "required."  This would create difficulty for providers
that use dynamic allocation.  The script language for automated
calling is not described, although sample scripts appear to be
provided in Appendix B.
 
The description of the various applications (Gopher, World Wide Web,
email, news, telnet, and ftp) is basically limited to explanations of
the interface, although organized in a functional style.  Ironically,
one of the few exceptions to the "just the interface" tutorial
recommends the use of "block files" (apparently directly analogous to
the more common kill files) as providing censorship for those with
children.  There is no indication of any means to prevent said
children from removing this "protection."

Date: 28 Aug 1995 19:36:55 GMT
Organization: Netcom


Keynote speakers and events have been finalized for the Enterprise
Management Summit to be held this October 23-27 at the Dallas InfoMart.

** Managing Information In The Next Millennium ** 
Monday, October 23,    1:00PM

Don Haile, General Manager, IBM Networking Software Division, will take
the wraps off IBM's networking strategy for the rest of the 90s and
beyond. Mr. Haile will discuss practical networking and software
solutions as enterprises work to improve their bottom line by
exploiting new technologies. He will cover the impact of the Internet,
and the debate over true interoperability in the distributed
client/server environment. He will also discuss the growing role of
systems management tools and services to help enterprises obtain and
manage the information they want, when they want it, from wherever it
resides. 

Mr. Haile is responsible for the development of programming and support
of all IBM communications platforms. The Networking Software Division
contributes over $2.5 Billion in revenue annually. Mr. Haile has been
with IBM for 31 years, holding a number of management positions in
software development, telecommunications, systems management, and
operating systems. He was named by IBM Chairman, Louis Gerstner, to
IBMs Worldwide Management Council in 1994, and was appointed to the
Board of Directors of Siemens-Rolm Corporation in 1995.

** Microsoft's Back Office Strategy **
Tuesday, October 24, 1:00PM

Jonathan Roberts, Director of Windows NT Marketing for Microsoft
Corporation, sets the direction for Microsoft's entire networking and
enterprise management strategy including Back Office, a key component
of Microsoft's product direction as it expands beyond the desktop. In
one of the most important keynotes of 1995, Mr. Roberts will answer the
question that everyone has been asking, Is Microsoft going to be a player 
in the management arena or not? He will cover Microsoft's strategy for
Windows 95 and NT Advanced Server, as well as it's position with regard to 
developing management platforms and a comprehensive set of products that 
work across multiple systems, networks, and applications.

Before his present postion, Mr. Roberts was in charge of rolling out
Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups.Products under his
control include Windows NT, Windows NT Advanced Server, Daytona, Cairo,
Hermes, and SNA Server. 

** Making Enterprise Management Work - A Real World Perspective **
Wednesday, October 25, 10:15AM

discussion of the state of enterprise management today. These top CIO's
will include a look at the state of enterprise management in their
organizations and the benefits which they are realizing. They will also
take a look into the future, examine what areas represent the greatest
need to them, and outline which enteprise management technologies hold
the most promise. This keynote session is sponsored by {Network
Computing Magazine}.

Moderator: Patricia Schnaidt, Editor-in-Chief, {Network Computing
Magazine}.

The Enterprise Management Summit '95 will be held this October 23-27 at
the Dallas InfoMart. Conference discounts and free exhibit passes are

Subject: Free Fax Testing Service
Date: 28 Aug 1995 17:49:41 GMT
Organization: Portal Communications (service)


We've upgraded our free TestBack<tm> fax testing service and you are
once again invited to try it.

Send a one page fax with data (data also gets tested and folks who
send blank pages are not getting all the information they could). It
would be nice, but not necessary, if you put your name and e-mail
address on the page so we can contact you if you have questions.  It
is so hard to sort blank pages to find yours!

You will receive a short report with major errors, if any,
pointed out.

To try this:

Fax a page to:  (510) 828-5617.
Wait 10 seconds (overseas no wait necessary)
Poll (510) 828-5617.

If you don't get the correct report, E-mail mrehmus@grayfax.com
and we'll try to find your report.  Blank pages excepted.

The way this works is that we receive the call, then analyze it after
the call is completed and make it available for the next Polling call.
This can have problems but we cannot think of another way to
accomplish this automatically without the possibility of other errors
creeping in or without greatly increasing the expense and engineering
time consumption.

From: wengler@ee.rochester.edu (Mike Wengler)
Subject: Usenet Like CB? No.


PAT discoursed on how the USENET had become like CB at its worst.

The USENET and the Internet both are fascinating things themselves,
but are also meta-fascinating as various pundits analyze them as
though they were something else already known.  Is it a telephone
network?  A mail system?  A newspaper?  A library?  PAT suggests
USENET is like radio spectrum in his last effort, and recently like CB
radio in the seventies.

However, the important differences are overwhelming.

1) you can always start a new newsgroup ... there are around 5,000
available to most people now.  Compared to 40 (?) CB channels with no
new ones in sight.  And the USENET channels are very different from
each other, based on name/subject matter.  Many of us are happy with
the groups we read ... alt.dcom.telecom and alt.cellular.technology in
my case are fine.  Very little SPAM or noise, no forged cancels, etc.

2) USENET can be changed.  That cancels are so easily forgeable is
just the way the news protocols have been defined.  Almost without
doubt, these protocols will be enhanced and USENET will survive.
"Death of the USENET predicted, news at 11" is one of the
quintessential self-referential cliches of the USENET which give it
its unique charm.  "Secure News" or SNEWS is the buzzword for the next
generation.  With CB, there wasn't much chance of changing broadcast
or reception protocols to protect against the "Spam" PAT described, so
it was CB itself which died.

Of course, PAT must not be faulted for his attempt at "The USENET is a
phone group.  No, the USENET is a magazine.  No, the USENET is a
soapbox.  No, the USENET is CB Radio."  The USENET is new, and we
don't have a consensus on how or even whether it should be regulated.
The USENET has problems.  We are being assaulted by the psychotic/commercial 
interests of scientology, and the "for your own good with a gun"
interests of congress.  We BETTER start comparing USENET to something,
hopefully something which is protected from interference, so we can
buffalo the g-men into protecting it for us, from themselves and
others.  (Is g-man for government-man or gun-man?)

But really, cancel forgeries need to get fixed in the software, not in
terms of getting people to behave differently.  And the new software
is being debated and developed, even as we continue to exist in our
warm fantasy of free, non-commercial speech.

IMHO of course, as always.

Subject: Working Around Capacity Problems
Date: 28 Aug 95 14:24:14 GMT
Organization: StarNet Communications, Inc


What do people do to get large numbers of phone lines, especially
when, say US West, won't plan ahead for capacity? Right now we have
about 240 phone lines coming in, but can't get any more until US West
decides where to drop a pair gaining switch into our premises. Up
until this point they were content with dropping us copper, (in fact,
that was their only solution, they don't mux out T-1's anymore, or
anything), but now that all distribution pairs in the street are used
up, they don't know what to do. We've been pushing on them for us
needed a large number of phone lines since last year when we moved
into this building, and we've been putting in large orders scheduled
out two or three months in advance, and then cutting them back the day before
they are scheduled to what we needed at that point, but until they ran
out of wires in the street, they did nothing to plan out.

The pair gain switch is scaring me, since all lines are data lines, and
I've seen other installations where you can't get full speed out of 
28.8 v.34 modems going through an SLC. Typically getting 24k or 26.4k
connections max.

I've been waiting now for two months on my last line order with still 
no lines in sight for them to drop. (Also having problems getting 
DDS lines as well, I have no idea where they think they are going to
be getting T-1's to pair gain off of). 

What are my options? (I am already considered buying a channel bank,
but that seems to be extreme, just to work around US West's problems)
to get US West to deliver on lines? The tarrif states that they have
to get us lines, but doesn't specify a time frame.

Just thought I'd relate how technically backward the folks at Nynex
are.  Caller-ID was recently made available to most of Rhode Island
but here are some problems with it:

a) It's calling number and date/time delivery only. Duh - I don't need
time/date but the name would be nice. Good going Nynex!

b) A call from an associate in MA shows as OUT OF AREA. I called my
long distance provider (who is also the friend's LD provider) and
they've verified that their network will indeed pass Caller-ID
information along. I call Nynex and ask them what the deal is. Turns
out, according to some droid that Nynex "Doesn't have the technology
to do that.".

I wish Mary Alice Williams would stop talking about "Nynex Now!" and
start talking about the real problems with what I propose is the worst
telephone company around other than GTE.

Date: Mon, 28 Aug 1995 18:31:45 EDT
Organization: APK - Internet Provider for Ohio.


When I tried calling the above-mentioned numbers, I received the
following: 

  1. Bo-doo-weep tones
  2. Harsh noise for about ten seconds
  3. click then silence

Curiously, the "SPKR" LED on my ATT Speakerphone then sort of FADED
away slowly, but the "LINE IN USE" LED stayed on.  Normally, when I
get the CPC reverse polarity after a hangup on the speaker phone, the
"SPKR" LED goes out followed by the "LINE IN USE" LED.


Rich Szabo


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Here in northern Illinois, Ameritech is
not yet programmed to recognize 888 as an area code. When I tried your
experiments here, dialing 1+888, etc, it went to the message saying
'When calling a number inside your area code dial only the seven digits.
When calling a number outside your area code dial 1 plus the area code
and the seven digits.'  Interestingly though, throughout the entire
intercept message (and even for a couple seconds before it started) there
was a constant 'clicking' noise, or perhaps 'ticking' noise at about two
second intervals. The 'when calling a number' intercept message is very
common; it always plays out when a one is entered before a non-working

tick/click sound along with it which is not part of the recording. It
sounds in a way like someone taking a phone on and off hook repeatedly
at about two second intervals.    PAT]

Subject: How to Distinquish Local From Long Distance Numbers


How can one determine whether certain numbers are within the calling
area and certain numbers are not?

For instance, I am in 301.294.xxxx and if i call 301.762.xxxx
its a local call. If I call 202.xxx.xxxx, its also a local call, but
if I call 301.428.xxxx, its a toll call. Is there any information
online about how the calling areas are divided? Can one from the first
six digits (npa) figure out which calling area he belongs to?  Is there
any logic to those numbers (sequential??? correlate to zip code?)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Your best bet is to ask the local telco
what is and is not part of your calling area. This gets very messy and
could (and has) consumed much time and space here as we go round and
round on the variances from one community to the next. If you ask, your
local teleco will supply you with a list of all the exchanges which are
considered part of your local calling area; you may assume exchanges not
listed are toll calls.   PAT]

Subject: CPUC Proposal


I'm actually going to be attending the meeting in L.A. on 9/20.  While
I may not know what the implications of this mean in reality, I'd
probably like to see PacBell get some competition -- or at the very
least, offer improved service for the kinda crap I seem to get now.

Here are some of my beefs -- if anyone has any ideas on which ones
would work, other points, etc., they would be welcome.  E-mail
me before the meeting ...

(1) PacBell offers priority ring -- will it work with someone calling
outside of PacBell's local calling area?  Say, someone five miles
away in GTE turf? Nope.  Sorry, dude.

(2) I'd like busy number redial -- won't work outside of my PacBell local 
calling area -- and that would include GTE turf as well.  

(3) I'd also like to see some competition with respect to rates for
Zone Unit/local long-distance calls -- PacBell and the biggies pulled
a big one when they convinced Gov. Wilson's PUC appointees that it's a
"good idea" to have the default billing for local long-distance calls
to be with one's local service provider, unless one enters a
five-digit prefix before dialing -- then you still don't know what
kind of prices you'll be getting.  Just don't pick Oncor, that's for
sure.  I'd like to see *declared* prices for toll calls -- sort of
like when you go to the supermarket, you can see the price tags, when
you go to a gas station ...

(4) I'd also like to see local phone companies stop deceptive
practices like charging someone a dollar a month for an unlisted
nubmer when someone can just pick a different name to be listed under,
i.e. Joey Ramone; like not really explaining to people how much of a
profit center/equivalent of extended warranty service contract rip-off
"inside wire maintenance" contracts are, with anything wrong usually
involving a three dollar piece of hardware.

(5) My local phone company should provide me with *any* phone book in
my local metropolitan area free of charge.  Right now, PacBell wants
me to fork over twenty clams for the privilege of using what should be
public information, and for what would conceivably be "good" for
PacBell directory advertisers ...

End of rant,

                        In vino veritas.

California Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California
August 1995

                   PHONE SERVICE FOR EVERYONE
               THE FACTS ABOUT UNIVERSAL SERVICE

WHAT IS UNIVERSAL SERVICE?

Universal Service means providing virtually everyone in the state with
a basic level of telecommunications services at reasonable rates.  It
ensures that low-income customers and customers in areas that are
expensive to serve (like mountain communities or less populated areas)
receive the same access to services as other customers.  Universal
service is not a new idea.  As described later, universal service
programs have been in effect for some time.

This fact sheet provides a summary of the issues and proposed rules
contained in the CPUC proposal which would govern all telecommunications 
carriers in California that provide basic telephone service.

THE LOCAL COMPETITION SITUATION

Currently, there is only one company providing local phone service in
your area.  However, in 1994, the California Legislature passed
Assembly Bill 3606, allowing other companies to offer local phone
service by January 1, 1997.  Local telephone competition will allow
you to choose a local telephone company the same way most people now
choose their long-distance company.  Rules recently issued by the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will allow long-distance
service providers, cable television companies and other companies to
become competitive local telephone companies as early as January 1, 1996.

These companies will be able to offer local telephone services in
addition to their current service offerings.  Local telephone
competition is expected to lower costs for you, the consumer, while
giving you the choice of newer, high quality services, in addition to
basic telephone service.

This competitive marketplace will foster economic growth and lead
to an improved telecommunications infrastructure for California.

What the CPUC is doing for you:

Principles guiding the Commission:

Ensuring that high-quality basic telecommunications services remain
available and affordable to all Californians regardless of geographic,
linguistic, cultural, ethnic, physical, or income considerations;

Providing consumers with the ability to choose among competing
telephone companies; 

Providing for the addition of new services to the basic service
package as these new services become more widely used, in order to
avoid some people having inferior access to information compared to
others;

Ensuring that customers have access to sufficient information to make
informed choices about basic service and universal lifeline telephone
service; and

Ensuring that telephone companies follow reliability, privacy and
security guidelines. 

THE CPUC  UNIVERSAL SERVICE PROPOSAL

Background:

The prospect of local telephone competition has raised some concerns
about a telephone company's "universal service" responsibilities in a
competitive environment.  In 1994, the California Legislature passed
Assembly Bill 3643, which requires the California Public Utilities
Commission, the state agency which regulates telephone companies, to
develop universal service policies in a competitive environment.  The
CPUC recently issued proposed rules for public comment which outline
its plan for maintaining affordable, high quality service within a
competitive environment.

The Commission released proposed rules on July 17, 1995, (Decision
95-07-050) for public comment.  The document outlines the definition
of minimum basic service, methods for subsidizing high cost service
areas, discounts for low-income consumers, and the need for consumer
information.  A final set of rules will be developed following public
hearings, filing of comments regarding the proposed rules, and
following any evidentiary hearings and/or legislative changes, if
necessary.

What is Basic Service?

Basic service is the set of features and capabilities consumers expect
when they order telephone service.  Basic service is not static, but
changes over time.  In the proposed universal service rules, the
Commission proposes a definition of what basic service is now, and how
it may change over time to include new services.

The Commission proposes that basic service should include what
Californians have come to expect when they order telephone service.
This includes a connection to the telephone network (the ability to
place and receive calls); access to the larger telephone network, such
as access to long distance carriers and information services; free
access to 911 emergency services; touch tone dialing; and billing
options, such as choice of flat and measured service.

As technology advances, new services will be offered.  Over time these
services may become so commonly used that they may be considered
essential.  Touch tone was once considered a premium service.  Over
time it became widely used and essential for many activities.  Touch
Tone is now included as part of basic service.  The Commission expects
that other, more advanced services may also become essential. For this
reason, the universal service rules propose reviewing the definition
of basic service every three years.  During these reviews the
Commission will consider the following factors: (1) Is the service
essential for participation in society? (2) Do a majority of
residential customers subscribe to the service? (3) Will the benefits
of adding the service to the basic service exceed the costs?

What About Service To Less Populated Areas?

Universal service also ensures that customers in areas that are
expensive to serve (like rural and mountain communities) receive the
same access to services as other customers.  In areas that are
expensive to serve, rates have been kept low in two ways.  First, the
California High Cost Fund (CHCF) reduces rates for customers of small
telephone companies.  All telephone customers currently contribute to
the CHCF through a small charge on their monthly phone bill.  Second,
by requiring large telephone companies to charge the same rate for
basic service within their territory, rates are kept at reasonable
levels in their high cost areas.

By introducing local competition, the Commission must consider new
ways to keep rates at reasonable levels.  Under the proposed universal
service rules, if you live in a designated high cost area, you will be
able to get a credit, or voucher, on your bill so your rates remain
affordable.  If there is more than one local telephone company serving
your high cost area, you can receive a similar credit regardless of
which telephone company you choose.

The purpose of this credit is to ensure that rates remain affordable
in areas where the costs of serving that community are high.  The
credit represents the difference between the cost of providing service
in an area and the rate the Commission considers affordable.  In order
to receive this credit for the customers it serves, a company must be
willing to accept an obligation to serve all customers in an area.  To
fund this universal service voucher program, the Commission proposes a
charge based on telephone company revenues.  Unlike the current high
cost fund, no direct charge would appear on your bill.

What About Low-Income Consumers?

Another aspect of universal service is providing lower rates for low
income customers.  The current Universal Lifeline Telephone Service
(ULTS) program for low income consumers will remain unchanged, with
the exception that it will be expanded to offer the choice of ULTS
providers.  Eligible low income customers will continue to pay either
$5.62 for residential flat rate service, or $3.00 for residential
measured service throughout the state.  This program is funded by a
small charge on all telephone bills.  What Information Do Customers
Need?

The CPUC is concerned about what information consumers need to make
informed choices about competing local telephone companies.  It
proposes that all local phone companies must provide customers basic
service information in a standard format.  Consumers will then be able
to make easy comparisons between basic service rates of different
local phone companies can be easily compared.  This is similar to the
way credit card companies present their rates.

CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

The CPUC recently established consumer protection rules governing new
local telephone companies in a related, ongoing CPUC proceeding.
These are interim rules, and will become effective January 1, 1996.
Consumer protection rules govern rate increase notice requirements,
disclosure of information to consumers when signing customers for
service, required procedures for handling billing complaints,
requirements for printing on bills information on how to receive help,
customer deposit return requirements, rules to provide for easy credit
establishment, privacy protection rules, and free blocking of 900 and
976 information service requirements.

HOW YOU CAN GET INVOLVED

The CPUC wants your comments on its proposed universal service rules.
To provide an opportunity for comment, we will be holding public
hearings throughout California in September and October (as listed
below). The meetings will consist of a 15 minute presentation by
Commission staff, followed by an open public comment period.  Comments
can be oral or written and CPUC staff will be available to respond to

Subject: Unabomber in the News, Again


So ... now they have decided -- as I did sometime back -- that the
mystery person known as Unabomber had his roots here in the northern
Illinois area.

A few weeks ago, I expressed my belief, based on conversations with
some net people, that Unabomber is a fellow whose initials are P.M.G.

The 'M' stands for Michael ... and the 'P' ... ummm ... oh what the
heck, it stands for Patrick. 

Well we had an interesting event right here in our little village of
Skokie yesterday. It seems the FBI came to visit the school teachers
in a large group meeting to discuss with them the case and ask them --
at least the ones who have been around as teachers for thirty years or
so -- to rack their brains and try to identify who this former pupil
of theirs might have been. Back in the era involved -- the 1960's --
we only had one high school in Niles Township (the sub-division of
Cook County, Illinois in which Skokie is located) and it was known in
those days as 'Nilehi' for short. Then came a second school and they
called it Niles West with the original Nilehi becoming Niles East.
Then came Niles North (a couple blocks from my house) in the middle
1970's and then later the closing of Niles East entirely as enrollment
dropped.

But hey! What the heck are they looking *over here* for?  My message
on the subject told them this fellow grew up in the Park Ridge and
Des Plaines area: that's the next township west, called Maine Township.
So now the FBI people are going to go over and question all the old-time 
school teachers over there at the Maine Township high schools, and
see what they know about it.

What the FBI needs to be doing is looking at the 'G' family when they
were living at 1030 Horne Street in Des Plaines, phone VAnderbilt 7-6895, 
back in the late 1960's and see if that direction gets them anywhere. It is  
my belief that PMG's father was a fellow named GG at that address who also 
operated for many years a company in Park Ridge called G(xxxxxx) Builders
and Development Company at 709 Devon in Park Ridge, phone TALcott 5-6654.
They built homes, you know,  like carpenters ... the children would have 
gone to the Maine Township schools, not the schools over here in Skokie
for chrissakes!

I wonder if they have looked at the connection I gave them for GG out
in San Fransisco, where the GG stands for the same name as the one here
in those days and the fellow who answers the phone seems figity and
nervous and lies through his teeth and admitted he used to live here in 
the area back in the 1970's, 'but only as a way to dodge the draft'. 

Nah, they probably have not had time to do all that ... after all,
there is a rumor going around on the Internet that some fellow in
Alaska logged in on the Internet one day and thinks he might possibly
have seen a message about kiddie porn somewhere; all available agents
have been sent up there to kick in his door, seize all his computer
equipment, inspect the encrypted files on his disk drive bit by bit,
interogate all his family members as material witnesses, etc.  No time
left to be getting all involved looking for Patrick Michael G ...
priorities, you know.

I would apply for the million dollar reward they offered for
information leading to his arrest, but it is likely they would weasel
out of that also.  You know how much dislike they have for this hotbed
of perversion and anarchy known as Internet, and they surely could
never bring themselves to admit that the people on this net helped
solve their mystery.  We are supposed to be causing them all their
grief, not helping resolve it, and don't you forget that.

So as exciting as it would be to find out that Unabomber grew up as a
child right here in our own little village of Skokie, I'm afraid the
FBI guys are looking a little too far to the east. They need to take
the advice of the author who said 'go west, young man ...'  Like maybe
about ten miles west out to Park Ridge/Des Plaines.

               -----------------------------------

In other Unabomber news, I got mail from James Bellaire and a few
other people who took me to task for claiming that the email I got
from the FBI on subject was fraudulent and forged. The folks who wrote
me about my 'stupid letter of the day' commentary enclosed evidence
that indeed, fbi.gov gets their feed from the service provider
mentioned. So, I guess that letter from the 'unabom task force' was
for real.  You who read it here will recall they thanked me for my
input and said that if further information was required they would be
in contact. Then what do they do but show up here in Niles Township to
talk to the teachers ... hey guys, for the last time, try Maine
Township, okay?  Check the school records over there, and check with
the old, probably retired employees of the Builder and Development
Company.

If I have to discuss this topic here again -- and personally I find it
repugnant -- I may just name him completely and forget to use initials.

Subject: Anyone Else Been Lied to by AT&T?
Date: Tue, 29 Aug 1995 21:39:30 GMT


In early July, AT&T (or their representatives) called me up and
offered me $50 to switch to AT&T. In a couple weeks, I got a check for
$10, and a $10 Preferred Customer Voucher. I called to complain and
was told that it takes four to six weeks to get the $50 check. So I
waited. Today I called and complained again. They apologized and
offered to send me a check to make up the difference of what they had
promised.

So, to get my $50, I have to stay on hold for 20 minutes, talk to three 
or four different people, mail in a coupon that isn't good until late 
September, and cash two checks if indeed I get the second one. This is 
not what I was promised, and if I hadn't persisted with them I wouldn't

This is classic bait and switch. Maybe it's AT&T lying to me, maybe
it's their contractors trying to pull a fast one, or maybe it was an

Subject: Keeping Smart on Mobile Technology


Hello.  Last week, I submitted a request for some adhoc responses to a
very informal survey I was conducting on how mobile technology users
(individuals, consumers, etc.)  get smart and stay informed or
educated on the technology *that they use for themselves*.  This last
emphasis was apparently not clear: the focus is on individual private
use of any type of mobile technology.

If you'd allow me to, I would like to request recipients of this
mailing to consider responding to this survey again, considering the
focus on mobile technology of any kind (cellular, laptop, printers,
PDAs, etc.) *which you use for yourselves*.

Hence, please respond back concerning the methods you utilize other
than books or magazines, such as attending trade shows, speaking to
dealers, speaking to colleagues or friends, using online discussion
groups, etc.

A single, quick email response listing the manner in which you stay up
to date on mobile technology would suffice.  

Thank you again for your assistance.

It looks like the 1-800-555 number space is available for "normal"
toll free phone numbers.

I got a call from a Contract-programmer broker in Texas (they wanted
to know if I was interested in a job down there), when I mentioned
that I wasn't interested but might be able to pass the lead on to a
friend who was interested in moving to TX, I was given a 1-800-555-
number.  I confirmed the number to make sure I heard it correctly.

Now what are the movies going to use to show someone dialing a toll
free number?

I was the one who faxed Carl Moore a few months back with this info,
to help him fill in the gaps in his Area Code history. It was
photocopies of NPA maps from various time periods in the late 1940's
and throughout the 1950's, from articles on Long-Distance, numbering and
dialing, switching, etc.  from Bell Telephone Magazine, Bell Laboratories 
Record magazine, Bell System Technical Journal, and from AT&T's Notes
on the Network (1955 edition which was then titled "Notes on Nationwide 
Dialing"), and from a historical list of NPA assignments that my contact 
at Bellcore faxed me last year.

All press-releases in newspapers (microfilm back issues of the {New
York Times}) or back issues of {Time, Life, Newsweek}, etc. had a brief
blurb of an article in late 1951 stating that the Mayor of Englewood
NJ called the mayors of San Francisco and nearby towns. Calls to
points east of San Francisco Bay (Oakland) were dialed 415 + NNX-XXXX
(there was NO 1+; just straight ten digits). The call from the
Englewood NJ mayor to the San Francisco mayor was dialed 318 + NNX-XXXX.
The call from Englewood to towns north of the Golden Gate were also
dialed 318 + NNX-XXXX. 

AT&T's publication entitled Events In Telecommunications History also
refers to the Englewood NJ trials.  Incidently, it was not known at
that time as DDD (Direct Distance Dialing) but something like Customer
Toll Dialing or Nationwide Customer Dialing (something like what the
UK used to call STD-Subscriber Trunk Dialing). There were also
articles on this in magazines such as {Popular Science, Popular
Mechanics, and Popular Electronics}. 318 was also mentioned.  BTW, the
'official' maps in Bell's magazines in the early 1950's did *not*
include 318!

WHY was there this *special* code I don't know for sure. I can only
guess that maybe there were some Central Office code/naming/letter
conflicts within the SF Bay area? or maybe it was a routing
determination? Incidently, when Englewood NJ was able to dial
long-distance in 1951, it was *only* to specified towns/cities, such
as Northern NJ area, NY City Metro area, Boston, Washington DC, SF Bay
area, Chicago, Philadelphia, etc. These larger metro areas were
predominantly Panel and Crossbar (#1 and #5) switching regions, with
little or no Step-by-Step, although there were still some operator/
manual local central offices in these cities. Automated Toll Switching
was handled on a #4XB switch. 

Maybe since only specific *cities* were identified by the dialable
areacode, it *could* be that AT&T wanted to identify Oakland as 415
and San Francisco as 318, until customers were more familiar with
nationwide toll dialing. It could be that AT&T wanted to eliminate
accidental wrong numbers (which would have been billed a MUCH higher
toll charge than we know today; unless you are using Integratel or
other AOSlime! <g>). If a NJ customer intended to dial 318 (San
Francisco), but followed with the seven dial pulls which was actually
an Oakland number (in error), then they *might* have gone to an
intercept recording/operator.

I don't know how long 318 was actually used to dial San Francisco -- I
have nothing in print showing when it was 'put-back-into' 415 or whatever, 
other than I do know that when Louisiana's 'single' NPA, 504, was
split in 1957, with 504 remaining for southeast Louisiana (New Orleans, 
Baton Rouge, etc), and 318 covering western/northern Louisiana
(Lafayette, New Iberia, Shreveport, Monroe, Alexandria, Lake Charles,
etc).

In an early 1950's issue of {Bell Telephone Magazine}, there was
mention of a Customer instruction booklets for Long-Distance dialing,
for those areas which *could* dial LD. There was a small photo of the
cover of a booklet and also some of the inside. However the resolution
of the photo was NOT good, and I could not make out any text of the
booklet itself in the magazine photo. It seems that the booklet gave
Area Codes for those points which were customer direct dialable from
that particular point at that time, and the Exchange Names and cities
within the area code that could be dialed. Even tho' today I can get
all of the current NPA-NXX info I want from Bellcore, I'd give
'anything' -- well not really <grin> for a copy of one of those 40+
year old booklets.

I wouldn't actually call the use of 318 for San Francisco a split -- but
that is the only case I know of this. Other than the fact that 903 had
been used for the *extreme* border of northwest Mexico but reclaimed
in 1980 when 70-6 was used (when AT&T and Telefonos de Mexico placed
these border towns more specifically in +52-6XX..), and then 70-6 and
90-5 being reclaimed; and lets not forget the TWX special Areacodes
(N10's) were 'reclaimed' when TWX was 'removed' from the Bell System's
DDD switching network. All of these codes (318, 903, 706, 905, 510,
610, 710, 810, 910) have uses today which were NOT there original use.

And, BTW, from Events in Telecommunications History (AT&T): on 15 June
1966, it is mentioned that Lowell Wingert of AT&T Long Lines placed a
call from Philadelphia to Geneva Switzerland by dialing 200-233-1011.
Of course this was some kind of special 'patch' code, since I had read
in issues of Bell's magazines dated prior to 1966 that 011+ was going
to be the IDDD access prefix, and that there were plans for Country
Codes as we know them today.  There is NO use of 41 for Switzerland in
this demonstration international call.

And, while I don't have exact dates (month, date) only the year of
introduction of Area Codes back in the 1940's, 50's, early 60's, I
don't think that 415 was split three-ways overnight into 408, 707, and a
smaller 415.

Also, I don't think that areacodes reaching 'capacity' meant the same
that it does today. Back then, the electromechanical switches diddn't
handle the capacity of lines and trunks, unlike the ESS and Digital
switches of today.  Even #4XB and #5XB had special routing considerations 
when assigning Central Office codes. Back then there was also a lot
more 'protection' of C/O codes when a 'community of interest' straddled 
an areacode boundary. These days there will be less and less of code
protection in the North American numbering plan, and rather more
mandatory ten-digit dialing, both across an NPA boundary, and even
within NPA's.

John Higdon is from the San Jose / San Francisco area. Maybe he might
have some info to enlighten us on 318's use for calling into SF from
outside of CA, or maybe some Bay area Exchange Name history -- (and SF
was probably the only area of the country that used 55X numbers before
All Number Calling -- KLondike-x (55X) WAS used in San Francisco, while
most areas of the country never seemed to use the 55X range prior to
the 1960s).

Gina,
      Let me start off by explaining that I am a semi-retired
independent telecommunications consultant (voice systems and networks)
with over 25 years experience in the industry.

      I have had the 500 service since that day after it was
announced. My experience is that is just doesn't work!  The reasons
are many, but the result is the same from many places. Even in the US,
access to 500 numbers is restricted and not just from pay phones
(where it is really needed), and privately owned systems (PBX's), but
also from homes and business accounts as well.  This is true even when
the long distance carrier for that number is AT&T.

      The concept is fine, just walk up to a phone, dial 1+500+xxx-xxxx and 
be connected. (0+500 is also an option, more on that later) The
reality is that in over 25 _personal attempts_ to do this from various
sites around the country, the call is denied UNLESS I first dial
10+ATT or 1-800-CALL-ATT.  For the astute business person, or someone
who is really determined to use the number (like myself) this
_sometimes_ works.  For others who are not so sophisticated the
process is a disaster.  _AT&T_ operators have told _me_ the following:
 
      "Those are porn numbers ... they can't be dialed from a pay phone."
(I wonder how many of my clients heard that one!)

      "There is no such thing as a 500 number ... you must mean an 800
number ... please try your call again ... thank you for using AT&T ...
<click> ... buzzz ..." (nice try ... time to use another service)

      "We can't connect you to that number, it must be dialed directly."
(AT&T states that when calling from outside the US, to contact them to
complete the call.)

      "My equipment won't accept that number as a valid number." (Maybe
not, but your billing equipment does.)
 
      There _are_ many more, but I can't remember all of them,
fortunately.  In my _considered signed personal opinion_ (which I
normally charge good money for) the 500 service from AT&T _should not
be considered_ as a viable option at this time.  When I see AT&T
making a serious attempt to correct the myriad of problems that plague
this service I _may_ reconsider that opinion.

      Until then, and because of the broken promises in relation to this
service, which I consider symptomatic of a growing problem with the quality
of service and serious lack of integrity at AT&T, I am doing the following:
 
      I have started reviewing _all_ of my past recommendations to clients
regarding the selection of a long distance carrier.  My professional
decision factors involving recommendations for service have always taken
into account more than price.  The real issue is this:
 
      When a company no longer can be counted on to deliver what it
      promises in quality or quantity it is time to re-evaluate it's role
      as a supplier.
 
      Over the course of my consulting career I made recommendations
totaling much more than $19 million dollars (per year) in long
distance usage.  I expect current use has increased that figure. After
my most recent discussion with an AT&T customer service supervisor
regarding a significant failure of an AT&T operators refusal to accept
my 500 number (plus pin) as a credit card number (from a restricted,
dial disabled, pay phone in North Carolina), which you are _supposed_
to be able to do, and the total failure of AT&T to address the myriad
of problems surrounding this 500 (and other) issues, I have decided to
go back to those clients and (for free) perform another analysis of
their long distance costs. The point is this:
 
      If we take the supposed business integrity of AT&T (or any other
      company) out of the picture, there is little to nothing to separate
      them other than price. If that is the case, and I believe that THEY
      have made it so, then I expect that many of the new analysis will
      show AT&T in a less than favorable light.  
 
      This is doubly sad because it is within their power to address
and fix these issues.  For some reason, they choose not to do so. And,
if they choose not to be a responsible organization, I choose take
that irresponsibility into account when determining recommendations
for any clients; future, present or past.
 
So, Gina, all that aside; my recommendations for your problems:
 
      Get a _very_good_ 24 hour telephone seven days per week
answering service.  Communicate with them frequently. Let them know
where you are at all times.  Pay whatever it cost.  If you _need_ the
service, the cost will be well worth it.
 

Glenn "Elephant" Foote ...... glnfoote@freenet.columbus.oh.us


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Actually my experience has, in general
been the opposite of yours. I have never seen a payphone which rejected
500 calls (other than the bug in the system a month ago reported here
which was fixed fairly promptly). I have never had to dial 10288 to get
through on 500, and furthermore, dialing 10288 would not make a whit of
difference anyway; we all know that the local telco examines all the
data given first and *then, provided they find it in their routing tables*
hand it off to the requested carrier. I can see a situation where the
local telco might examine the 500 prefix and hand it to the carrier who
is assigned that prefix or number, as is done with 800 calls now, but in
that case your use of 10xxx would not matter either, just as 10xxx means
nothing when dialing an 800 number.   PAT]

He also goes by the name Robert Ricketts.  Last I knew (April '95) his

I second that.  Mr. Ricketts keeps up with all the new NPA's too.  The
new version adds multiple ZIPs per NXX as well as labeling NXXs based
on type (USA only, Cellular or Landline).  Although there are a few
errors in which NXXs are assigned to cellular, probably carried from
his source.

BTW: The new version <Jul08> is available via CompuServe (GO TELECOM).  It

Hey, my girlfriend's father did just that!  He quit his job at Chevron
and opened his own refinery.  While it didn't make him another Rockefeller, 
she did grow up in a "two boat family".  He passed away several years

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: You are right of course. It can happen
here, but sadly a lot less often than it used to many years ago. Remind
me sometime to tell the story of a fellow nicknamed 'Cappy' who worked
for Illinois Bell back in the 1950-60 era. One day he got fed up, and
with a fellow worker they withdrew all their profit sharing/pension plan
money and moved to some little town in Arizona where they bought the
local telephone cooperative which was on the verge of bankruptcy. They
found wires strung along cattle ranchers fences through the countryside,
susbcriber equipment dating back to the 1930's, etc ... a horrible mess.
But by golly they cleaned it up over a period of a few years and later
sold it for a huge profit. Indeed, it can be done. And what about that
fellow in (I think) Utah with the tiny little telco with a grand total
of eight subscribers?  Is he still around?   You are right ... only in
America.  PAT]

In 1986 I was hired to automate a travel agency which did African
Tours.

This being before FAX machines were widespread, most of the
correspondence to Africa was done via Telex.  The agency was rapidly
growing, had purchased a computer, and was seeking to automate
operations wherever possible.

Easylink (store and forward telex via E-mail) from WUTCO had become
available, so with a few hacks to sendmail (UNIX mail program) I was
able to gateway mail into the telex network.  Before then, the company
had a full time telex operator, and telexes were frequently delayed,
went out with the usual mis-spellings due to bad transcription, etc.
Now people could type their own telexes at their desk, and send them
immediately.

So, was everybody happy?  Of course not.  As the case with most travel
agencies, annual turnover was close to 100%, so every month, I would
get a call from the new person, asking "Where's the telex machine?". I
would explain that you prepared telexes with the word processor, and
then e-mailed them to the telex network.  "Ok, how to I punch the
tape, then?" ...

After a few rounds of this, I dug a telex machine out of the dump,
cleaned it up, hooked it to the computer using the current loop
interface, and wrote some shell scripts to simulate connecting to the
telex network.

This worked great for a while.  Then, while I was in Africa, on a
tour, I started getting *telegrams* from the agency, that the telex
machine was broken, and that WUTCO refused to fix it.  The office was
in a total uproar, and they couldn't do business.  In the meantime,
they messengered telexes to the local WUTCO office to carry on.

When I got back, I looked at the computer to troubleshoot the problem.
There was no dial tone at the modem.  I saw a shiny new FAX machine in
the office and noticed its phone line was plugged into ... THE MODEM
LINE!!!!!!

I placed a call to WUTCO, had them install a hard-wired line to the
the telex network, and everybody was happy ever after ... until WUTCO
got out of the telex business.  But, by then, the African travel boom
was over and FAX was king.

Moral of the story: User Interface is everything!


Cheers, etc.,

PJK

I remember reading a blurb in {The Washington Post} about using 555
numbers.  It stated that Bellcore had agreed with the movie studios
certain combinations would not be issued.  These combinations could
and would continue to be used in movies and television programs.
Thus, as an example, 555-1234 would not be issued and would be
available for use by the entertainment and advertising industries.

A few years ago a Charles Bronson movie, Telephon, was released.  The
distributor, Universal(?) set up an 800 number for some purpose which
was reached by dialing 1.800.TELEPHO(n).  I wonder who has 1.800.835.3746 
now?

Yes, 800-555 was made available to "regular" numbers sometime last
year, I think in December. Maybe Judith Oppenheimer has some more
details on this.

I remember seeing it in Bellcore TRA's INPG fiche (Industry Numbering
Plan Guide) and LERG when I last ordered them in December 1994.

I also remember that one of my free mailings from Bellcore NANPA last year 
stated that 800-555 was going into the "general" portability pool.

Some of my Bellcore free mailings from NANPA, the ICCF, and the INC
have talked about *other* NPA's using the 555 exchange code for
services *other* than regular Directory Assistance or other telco
services. Bellcore NANPA is working with 555-XXXX line number
assignments, and it *seems* that this will be yet *another* 976-type
of code! :-(

There are plans for single NPA assignments of particular 555-XXXX
numbers, regional or multiple-NPA assignments of a particular 555
number to a particular subscriber, and national/NANP-wide/most-NPA's
assignments of a specific 555-XXXX number.

MANY 555 numbers, it seems, are now in *conflict* according to one of
my mailings from Bellcore/ICCF/INC. There were *simultaneous* requests
for the same groups of XXXX line-numbers, such as 6397 (NEWS), 8255
(TALK), 5683 (LOVE), etc. The mailings I got listed the line numbers
which are in *conflict*, along with the multiple *simultaneous*
requesting companies, but not the "letter" mnuemonics. There were even
some numericals which would even spell out profanities, but as I said,
the mailing only listed XXXX numbers- NOT letters/names. BTW,
Cap.Cities/ABC (Radio & TV News, etc) requested some of the form 7777,
and I think that CBS-The Columbia Broadcasting System had requested
some 2222 or the like. ABC-TV owns several TV stations in the US on
Channel 7, while CBS has many Channel 2's. Or even if they don't *own* the
station, many affiliates are on those channels.

For motion-picture/TV/Radio/dramatic fiction, etc, the 0100 to 0199 block 
of line numbers are NOT going to be assigned to working numbers within the 
NPA-555-XXXX service. I don't know how this is going to apply to 
800-555-XXXX, tho'.

Noticed the same thing with 1-900-555 yesterday, as the Priority
support number for Artisoft is 1 900 555-8324, used it in resolving a
LANtastic problem, so I know it wasn't a typo. :)

Speaking of Hollywood (and its use of 555-xxxx, not just in area 800,
in movies etc.):

I Love Lucy had telephone numbers in it from time to time.  They
changed from time to time, too; the phone company supplied them to
ensure there would be no answer if fans tried calling them.

Here's a thought.  Perhaps the movies should get rid of the 555 thing
altogether and instead use real live 1-900 numbers.  Then, if anyone
is curious enough to dial the number heard in the movie, the studio
could collect revenue at the rate $X.XX per minute.  Hey, that might
offset at least some of the cost of Waterworld!

So am I, born in Oakland and raised in the East Bay. I don't remember
the 318 area code at all, but I was only 6 in 1951, so that's not
surprising.  We had the very neat Hayward phone number of LUcerne
2-3456.  But sometime, probably the late fifties, many people's phone
numbers were changed and ours became BRowning 6-xxxx.  I don't know
the reason.  Maybe a new CO was built.

Seven-digit dialing between 415 and the Bay Area portion of 408
existed until some time in 1983, and the prefix list in the front of
the phone book did not distinguish the area codes either.  (In the few
cases where duplicate prefixes existed, usually in 415/707 or 408/707,
they inserted an asterisk with the note, "Some prefixes serve more
than one community.")

To my knowledge, there was never seven-digit dialing between 415 and
707 (or 408 and 707, which are not adjacent).  However, the split was
before I moved here.

    I gather that there are some tech support services offered via 900
numbers, as well as some fax-on-demand services that also use a 900
number. Since these may be "legitimate" business services I was
wondering if call blocking is (generally) sophisticated enough to
permit blocking of, say, all 900 numbers except an approved list of
legit numbers. Are most people stuck with all or nothing blocking? Was
MCI's directory assistance 900 service badly damaged by call blocking
by businesses?
    
    Also, while on the general topic of, uhh, entertainment services
via telephone, I am aware that some such service providers have
resorted to deals with foreign country telephone companies to avoid
900/976 style blocking. I am curious about why we have, as far as I
know, thus far been spared a 10-XXX (appropiate, yes?) phone service?
Does the FCC sufficiently regulate long distance companies to prohibit
"dial 10-HOT-SEX-TALK" or have other mechanisms been easier to
implement for the 900 industry?

Tom,

A phone number is comprised of NPA-NXX-EXTN.  Your local telco will
have a list of the NPA-NXX's that are local.  All other NPA-NXX's
are toll and will be charged at different rates.  Your phone book
may have the list but usually not.

By the way, I suggest dialling your long distance carrier's code
prior to making those calls that are not considered local by your
telco.  This will save you big bucks.

Just dial 10XXX before dialing your number where:

        XXX is 222 for MCI, 333 for Sprint, and 288 for AT&T.

Hope this helps,


Jim

In Massachusetts, the list depends on the calling plan you've signed
up for.  There are also two local calling areas, called Zone 1 and
Zone 2; the definition of these zones depends on the calling exchange,
and anything not in one of the zones is long distance.  Zone 1 is also
divided into Local and Other.

The service levels in the Boston Metropolitan area include:

* Measured: all calls are toll calls, with the rate depending on the zone;
* Unlimited: unlimited, untimed calls to Local Zone 1, otherwise like
Measured;
* Measured Circle: Measured or Unlimited, plus 2 hours/month of calls to
exchanges outside Local Zone 1 but within 25 miles;
* Circle: Unlimited calls within 20 miles;
* Suburban: unlimited calls within your own exchange and to Metropolitan
Boston exchanges *except* for Boston Central exchanges (I can't imagine why
anyone would get this -- who *doesn't* call Boston?);
* Metropolitan: unlimited calls to Metropolitan Boston and selected
exchanges depending on where you're calling from;
* Bay State East: unlimited calls to Metropolitan Boston plus 2 hours/month
of calls to other exchanges in Eastern Massachusetts *except* 9AM-Noon
weekdays.

All the relevant exchanges and rates are listed in the local phone books.

The department numbers (which were originally assigned alphabetically; since 
then additions and renamings have spoiled the regularity) have also never 
had anything to do with telephone area codes. The 1985 reorganisation was 
prompted to a large extent by the fact that all possible area codes had been 
assigned at that point.  Strange situations resulted, with (7) for the city 
of Lyon but (76) for Grenoble (which meant that Lyon numbers could and
did have 7 digits, but that they could not begin with 6).

Tony Harminc's remark is pertinent to French postal codes (which are based
on the departement numbers), but that is not very relevant to telecom.

Here in Italy, where variable-length numbers are the norm, the system
is constructed so that it is always possible in principle to determine
from the digits dialled so far whether the number is complete or not.
That is, 2345 67 and 2345 678 cannot both be valid numbers, but you
can have 2345 67 and 2345 680, 2345 681, etc. In theory, this means
that timeouts are never absolutely necessary. Of course for long
distance calls it will not be practical for the originating exchange
to store the detailed number length tables for every possible remote
exchange, but the information can be requested from the destination
exchange during call setup. I don't know whether this is actually
being done: I'm not obsessed with having the shortest possible call
setup time myself. (Even a timeout would be much shorter than the time
spent waiting for the person at the other end to pick up the phone.)

Irrelevant to the discussion of variable length numbers in Europe: my
switch doesn't interpret the # key that way, and attempts to use it
are treated as misdialed numbers. But I know it works in the USA.

I suspect that the cost of reprogramming all that data entry software
that expects NXX-NXX-XXXX for phone numbers is the real reason the USA
are trying to stick to 3+7 for as long as possible. As you note, there
is no intrinsic reason from the point of view of the network itself.
(Related question: why are the USA still using only nine digits for
Social Security Numbers, despite all the obvious shortcomings?)

Subject: Other "Special" Areacodes
Date: 30 Aug 1995 13:43:45 GMT
Organization: Tulane University


Since I have made recent posts on Mexico, TWX, and the use of 318 for
San Francisco, and since I mentioned (in "809 in Jeopardy") the
'replace' code for "Caller-Pays-800" including the 'self-assigned' use
of 300 & 400 by Caribbean countries/islands for "caller-pays-800", I
wanted to mention some *other* special NPA codes.

I had mentioned about 880 being planned as a *standard* replace-type
of code if the caller wants to pay for an 800 number not available
from his calling area (at least from International/Overseas). At the
time I posted this to TD, I stated that I didn't know what was going
to be used for the 'replace' code for the new toll-free 888 code.
Recently, one of my free mailings from Bellcore stated that 881 is
being planned for 'replace' for Caller-Pays-888.  NOW, I do NOT know
how this will 'interwork' with the 'mark-sense' codes for billing-
identification purposes for remote manual operator-connect-only
'Ring-Down' points. 880 is NOT used for ring-down points, but 881-XXX
IS!  Also, 888-XXX is used as well!

We have had 800 for Toll Free since circa 1966/67. 900 was reserved for 
'mass-calling' as a 'choke' code in 1970, but its use as a nationwide or 
continentwide PAY-PAY-PAY-per-call special areacode didn't come into use 
until around 1981 or 82. There were the TWX codes, 510, 610, 710, 810, 910. 
610 remained the Canadian TWX (and later Data services) until it was splash 
cut to 600 in 1993. 510, 710, 810, 910 (while probably still used on the 
now-again AT&T 'non-telco' TWX/Telex-II) were 'removed' from the DDD 
Telephone Switching Network by 1982 or so and along with 610 have been 
re-assigned as regular telephone NPA's. Specifically, 710 was reassigned 
circa 1983 to the US Federal Government, but it was about 10 years before 
many of us saw any other reference to it (for the GETS-Government Emergency 
Telephone Service/System), and that is *still* somewhat unspecified. We have 
*also* known about 700 since around 1983/84, being reserved for 
'carrier-services' sometime around divestiture. I understand that Canada is 
now using 700 numbers, similar to the way we use them here. And, of course, 
there is the 500 special areacode.

There is yet *another* special areacode, and its details/assignments
are still somewhat cloudy. Back in 1993, Bellcore reserved the 456
(new format) areacode for "International Inbound" purposes. There IS a
NANPA IL (Information Letter) explaining it, as well as mailings from
ICCF/INC. It will be assigned to carriers, *similar* to the way
500-NXX, 600-NXX, 900-NXX are being assigned now, and (prior to
portability), 800-NXX; HOWEVER, due to some foreign telco or
International Carrier code translations, a carrier requesting 456-NXX
codes will be assigned a *block-of-ten* NXX codes- the carrier will
have ALL TEN codes within a particular 456-NX.

I haven't purchased a Bellcore TRA LERG or INPG (or other product) in
almost a year, but there was NO listing of any 456-NX(X) assignments
when I purchased them last December. Incidently, there were also no
assignment listings of any 555-XXXX (for ANY NPA) in them neither.

I have the opposite problem.  I have Caller-ID sent on long distance calls
with no way to block it.  This may be happening to other people without
their knowledge.

My local exchange does not have SS7 and does not have Caller-ID.  The
blocking code for Caller-ID produces an error message.

When I call from MA (508) to CT (203) my number appears on the ID box in CT.

Nynex confirmed that they are not generating any Caller-ID information
and are only passing the billing information the the LD carrier.  My
LD carrier (Corporate Telemanagement Group) at first insisted that
what I was saying was impossible.  I went through several people and
finally ended up with their technical person who also insisted it was
impossible.

After I insisted several times the it WAS happening, he finally
admitted that they subcontract their New England traffic to another
carrier (WIL-TEL) who may be doing something strange.

They promised to check it out and get back to me.  If any interesting
information comes back, I'll send it along.

  Date: Sat, 26 Aug 1995 17:14 -0400
  From: Bob_Frankston@frankston.com
  Subject: Phone-mail woes

In anticipating traveling internationally, I decided to get CO-based phone
mail since I thought it would be more reliable to connect to than my analog
answering machine.  Because I've got two lines, I decided that I'd put the
service on the second line and then forward the first to the second when I
need to. I tried testing the forwarding and found that when I called the
first number, instead of just giving me voice mail, it asked me to key in a
number, presumably the number I was calling -- the first number. So I
obliged, and got a message from someone saying he was in Central America and
couldn't answer the calls.

* The request to key in the number is clearly a bug since the caller doesn't
know that I've forwarded the call nor the number to which I forwarded the
call.

* Since my ownership of both number predates the installation of the switch,
it seemed that the caller gets directed into hyperspace.

* When asking for the service, I was told that they were planning to drop the
stutter dialtone since it didn't work reliably!

* I did not test the interactions with distinctive ringing numbers. I feared
the worst but didn't have the time.

In speaking to the service people about this, the basic response is that
this is a problem with the DMS-100 (Northern Telecom) switch and not
necessarily the ATT ESS switches. This is the same DMS that, on my ISDN
line, requires two numbers for a 2B call whereas the ESS needs only one.

I don't know what profound lessons there are to learn except that I'm amazed
out the presence of such a gross bug in an expensive production CO. It would
never be tolerated in a $29.99 software package. This is a feature
interaction but unlike the problems with ad-hoc interaction between
separately produced features, this should be testable. Note, though, that
voice mail is often provided by a third party, such as Octel, and the bug
could be due to version interactions between two disparate systems.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Something is wrong here with his account
of what happened (is happening) ... generally the reason it asks for the
caller to enter the number he is calling is because somehow the network
did not deliver ANI properly to voicemail. Had voicemail known who was
being called, the proper greeting would have played out rather than the
generic 'please enter the number' message. Anyone can forward their line
to whatever number is used in their community for voicemail, however if
the incoming call is not from someone calling a recognized voicemail
subscriber, the voicemail system is going ask them in effect what they
are doing there and what they want. I imagine voicemail must have seen
the number of his first line (which as I understand is not subscribed to
voicemail) and was in effect asking 'how did you get here?', not realizing
that an actual subscriber (his second line) was transferring the call there.
It would be interesting also to find out if he conducted his tests using
*the same phone lines involved* or if he went to some third-location where
the response might be different.   PAT]

Not quite that bad - and a lot of it comes from needing overlap
periods between old and new. Previous to the recent '01', the last
major change in the UK scheme was shifting London numbers from
01-xxx-yyyy to 081- and 071-. By doing this, it freed up the whole of
the 01 number space which allowed the most recent change to occur.
Other minor changes have been steadily taking place, which often mean
the changing of numbers to have the same number of digits and reducing
the number of area codes in use.

The eventual plan, according to the consultative document, is for all
mobile prefixes to be grouped together, all toll-free numbers to be
grouped together etc. Obviously this couldn't happen until after the
01 change on geograpic numbers because until then you couldn't prefix
all mobile codes with 03 (which I believe i suggested for mobiles).
Now the numbering space has been freed up, it may be that 0336, 0860
etc will change to 03336, 03860 etc, thus showing them to be mobile
numbers.

There is method in the madness somewhere -- you just have to look hard 
for it!

As mentioned, this principle was in the original plan. From memory,
the suggestions were: 01 and 02 for geographic codes, 03 for mobiles,
07 for portable numbers, 08 for toll-free and 09 for premium rate.

Whether it actually happens like that remains to be seen ...

In a prior article which I realize had no correction, dealing with the 
practice of the back-office contractor staff taking unprocessed telephone 
service orders and throwing them into the wastebasket undone, I reported 
that Bell Atlantic, the local telephone company for DC, MD, VA, PA, WV 
and NJ (and perhaps other states) was headquartered in Richmond, VA.

According to an anonymous Bell Atlantic employee who called me to tell 
me something about the story I wrote, and by a reader of the Digest, 
The actual headquarters of Bell Atlantic Corporation is in 
Philadelphia, PA.

Subject: About Errors in Articles Posted
Organization: Tansin A. Darcos & Company/TDR,Inc. Silver Spring, MD USA


I'd like to add a followup item to a recent correction of an article I 
submitted here.

Let me note that in any kind of publication - a digest such as this,
regular Usenet Newsgroup Articles, and especially in the daily papers
and weekly magazines - there are going to be errors, mistatements, and
misquotations of material.

This point was brought home to me by the cablecast yesterday of the tv 
series "Lou Grant," in which the same reporter had exclusive stories on 
two days in a row, and both stories were wrong.

In the case involved, the reporter had the facts correct, but what he 
read from those facts gave him a conclusion -- which, given what had 
happened, a reasonable person of intelligence, without biases, would have 
made the identical one -- and his conclusion was wrong.

In other cases, facts are in error, or are misunderstood, or in some
cases are intentionally reported wrong, either to prevent someone from
becoming subject to blame or sanctions, or to allow someone to
determine if blame or sanctions should be placed on someone else,
and/or to preserve the ability to investigate or punish some
wrongdoing.  And sometimes it's done to cover up for someone or to
make some scapegoat take the fall for someone else.

One example being when I wrote up some of my comments regarding the
Oklahoma City Bombing and the effect on telephone service there as
well as changes here in the Washington, DC. Area.  Almost every story
that came out required changing because as more information became
known, the facts became more substantial, and could be better
substantiated (or those who were hiding things had more time to
practice their lies).

I do not remember hearing any serious criticism of this constant
requirement to change erroneous or misreported facts, and I believe
the reason is simple: people who watch TV or read newspapers can
understand that not all the evidence is available right away, and in
some cases what is reported is discovered to be incorrect or was
incomplete.  We have to accept this inaccuracy as part of the "cost of
doing business" in order to have very-fast reporting of information.
Checking and rechecking details from multiple sources is time
consuming.

Where the results of the error could be harmful or injurious to others, 
it should, if reasonably possible, be checked for accuracy.  It may still 
be wrong, but at least rechecking shows that they are acting responsibly.

In some cases, if a fact is received from a reasonable source,
reporting it as it stands with the realization (whether or not stated)
that it may be wrong, is reasonable.  For example, in any similar
incident involving a disaster, reporting there are 20 dead when there
are actually 80, or estimating deaths to be 3,000 when the number was
around 300, is not going to be as serious as misreporting a specific
person was dead when they were not, especially for the relatives of
the victim.

So, a small suggestion to people -- when you read something in this
Digest or *especially* on Usenet -- if you notice something is wrong,
you should report that if you have evidence to suggest otherwise, but
you should not be flaming or insulting someone for their errors (you
shouldn't be doing that anyway, but that's another issue altogether).
None of us is omnipotent, we all make mistakes and errors.  The
correct stance is to learn to understand that not all incorrect
material is the result of intentional bias (although, I'm sure that
some is), but can often can be traced back to simple misunderstanding
or human error of a minor detail.

In short, take it easy, and don't take things you see or read in the
media all that seriously.  And sometimes consider if what you are
reading is true, a lot of people intentionally lie or misstate the
facts in order to promote some social goal, and you may or may not
support that particular goal.

In the end, your best judge of the truth is your own intelligence: does
what they say seem reasonable?  

Is what they are saying is happening true? Is what they want to happen
soon, and what does happen now in the world compatible with each
other?  And most importantly, does their own lifestyle or standard of
living capable of being sustained if what they want is proposed?

The first tells you if they are truthful.  The second tells you if
they are demanding the impossible, or want to impose things on the
public, even if it means shoving an unwanted standard upon people down
their throats whether they want it or not.  The third tells you if
they are hypocrites.

You can't know all the answers to everything; there's not enough time
to learn enough to know the correct side of the issue.  But you can
try to find out why some people support some sides.  Or you can listen
to some people that you agree with on a large number of points and
hear their opinions.  But in the end, whatever you choose to believe,
is your own responsibility, and if that belief in whatever fact or
opinion you accept as valid is wrong, then you have to take the
consequences.

AT&T *hires* or *contracts* out their telemarketing!  My mother has
been solicited with "business opportunities" to telemarket AT&T on
contract.

Guess what ... if a telemarketer can make money by signing you up, but
you want to think about it and call back, they will not make that
money. (Plus there's the old thing in sales about "CLOSE THE DEAL!",
once you're off the phone you are probabilistically history anyway.)

Even if AT&T *service* is or is not any better than the competitors,
its *marketing* is constrained by the same pirhanic laws of nature as
everybody elses.  Benefits of competition and all that.

The are *selling* you their reputation for serice.  Their reputation.
Not the service itself.  That would go on the cost side of the balance
sheet, not the revenue.

Months of investigation have lead me to conclude you should ALWAYS
cash those checks.  Then take the next incentive to switch to the next
place.  With a small residential account, those checks are the ONLY
way to cut your long distance "rates" significantly ... that $100
check probably pays three to five months of your LD bill!

I am very unhappy about the decision to split the NPA in CT, adding
860 to the current 203, especially because MY phone number has to
change.  I would rather have an overlay and dial 10D to a local call.
(But I also seem to easily remember numbers like my car's VIN, my
driver's license number, etc.)

Anyway, now that this change is happening, I need to reprogram my cell
phone.  I could just go to the dealer to have it done, but that's the
easy way out.  Why can't the manual that came with my phone tell me
ALL of the functions?  I have a Motorola flip phone -- I know there
are various models -- can anyone tell me how to reprogram it, or if
there is an ftp site full of data on cell phones?  I feel rather
useless when I must depend on the technician or salesperson at the
phone dealer for such a trivial matter.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The September/October, 1995 issue of
Tom Farley's magazine {Private Line} has an article on this very
topic written by Damien Thorn entitled "Cellular Test Mode Scanning",

I served as principal telecommunications policy analyst with the CA
legislature as the move toward removing payphones gained full force,
in the mid-1980s.  Although it's fun and popular to attribute
controversial policy decisions, like the removal of payphones, to
stupid politicians "battling" drugs, in fact this policy originated
with the local telephone companies themselves.  I remember in
particular a PUC action designating payphones a "competitive" market,
which all knew originated with the telcos and had their full support.

The telcos' idea was, and remains, to maximize profit by limiting
service to high-security, high-spending venues (like airports, upscale
shopping malls, and tourist hotels).  Private firms take over the
marginal phones, charging more through AOS to ensure a profitable ROI
even though the cost of maintaining marginal phones may be higher and
their use less intense.  Payphones that neither the telcos nor the
private firms wanted to operate are simply removed.  The drug thing
was strictly a red herring, though historically fortuitous as a ruse.

In CA, a bill requiring a neighborhood hearing before a phone was
removed was watered down to simply require a notice to be slapped on
a phone before it was yanked.  I think the advance notice was 14 days,
just enough time to call the PUC and request redress -- but not soon
enough to actually interfere with the removal of the payphone.

Just wanted to set the story straight.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: What you say may have happened in
Calif- ornia, but here at least, Illinois Bell flatly denied for the
record on a couple of occassions having anything at all to do with the
manipulation of payphone locations and the working characteristics
(i.e. no coin after dark, etc) of payphones. They stated it was purely 
in response to community pressures and law enforcement requests. The
reason this came up was because persons who were stuck with the 'no
coin after dark' rule went to Bell demanding a rebate on operator
surcharges saying that it was not their desire to use the operator to
place a call (via calling card), and that they should not be penalized
with a surcharge for their inability to 'dial direct'. You will recall
that for however long, telcos routinely handled non-dialable calls at
the direct dial rate rather than penalize customers. Illinois Bell's
response was to speak with the self-proclaimed 'community representatives'
who put the pressure on the 7/Eleven stores regards the pay phones in
their parking lots, etc. On those payphones located on the public way,
i.e. a sidewalk where the 'subscriber' to the telephone was given in
records as Illinois Bell itself, their response was that they operated
those phones at the pleasure of the City of Chicago and its City Council
whose mandates had to be observed, again, i.e., the police want to see
the phone set up as one way outbound only, no coins after dark, or 
removed completely, etc. So, said IBT, talk to the community, not us. 

It is all in who you know of course, and whether your politician friends
and attorney can suck-up better than my politician friends and attorney.
Although just as many drug transactions are done each day by the cocaine-
snorting people who work at the Chicago Board of Trade and other financial
houses on LaSalle Street downtown, you don't presume *their* payphones
would ever be removed or modified do you?  PAT]

I enjoy gambling (in Louisiana, its legally known as 'GAMING' not
gambling). We now have a landbased casino in New Orleans proper and
various gambling boats in suburban areas. I haven't yet been to them
in New Orleans, but I do enjoy gambling on the boats in Mississippi
(601) along the Gulf Coast. I just do NOT enjoy gambling that the
payphone (COCOT) will put my call thru at the correct rates, via the
carrier *I* want.

About a month ago, the New Orleans City Circus -- Council -- no maybe
circus was right the first time <g> -- passed an ordinance that bars
and liquor stores cannot have an outside payphone, even if it is on
private property.  This is 'supposed' to help out on the 'war' on
drugs and crime. Most of these payphones are not SCBell telco
payphones, but -- you guessed it -- COCOTS.

AND, could the City be trying to squeeze out payphone competition?
About a year and a half ago, City Hall cancelled its contract with
South Central Bell (Bell South) for payphones on City-owned property
 -- whether in City office buildings, or outside on City parks, grassy
"Neutral-Grounds" (what we call boulevard medians here), or on the
city side of the property line on sidewalks. Over a period of six to
eight months, Bell was one by one removing outside payphones on the
city contract, and 'GLOBAL' Telslime - I mean Telcoin - came in. These
charged overtime for local calls, did not have all local NNX c/o codes
programmed in as local (some newer ones like my 460 for my cellular
STILL isn't programmed as local), and the usual.  Initially, Global's
PAY-PAY-PAY-PHONIES would NOT give you a LEC (Bell) operator on a
single 0 or on 0+ inTRA-Lata. After a few months and several complaints 
to the Public Service Commission, they were reprogrammed to route you
to Bell operators for 0- and InTRA-LATA 0+. (I CAN get 950-XXXX,
1-800-, and 10-XXX+ access to other carriers okay; I only wish SCBell
and ALL Local Exchange Carriers had a 10-XXX/101-XXXX, 950- and 800
number as well)

Global (aka Schlumberger Industries) has been in and out of trouble
with the PSC before. Global is HIGHLY connected politically with other
state and various local political figures. They have also had the
'prison' contract with the state over the past several years. There
have been MANY complaints over the past three to five years from
families, relatives and friends of prisoners at the State Pen and
other low-security prisons from around the state that they have been
billed HUGE collect or third party charges on their local telco bill due
to the unregulated AOSlime that Global's prison phones use. The PSC is
ALWAYS trying to get after Global, but due to the other political
connections Global has, it seems to be only a slap on the wrist.
Maybe the FCC should step in and pre-empt various states who don't
keep Private-Payphones/AOSlime in line. If a state's regulations could
be proven to be even tougher than that of the FCC, then that state's
regulations would be the law in that state.

Theodore Vail must be turning in his grave, probably since 1 Jan 1984!

the United States government is concerned, there is always the *implied
presence of guns*. It rarely gets that far of course because everyone 
understands the basic rules here. They always start out like gentlemen.
 
If anything here in the Chicago area, the city council favors Illinois Bell
over the COCOT people. Maybe its because IBT people pay bigger bribes to
the council members to keep the exclusive contract on payphones at Ohare
Airport. When that scandal broke here a few years ago, everyone just said
'ho-hum' and went on about their business. But in fairness to the COCOT
people, if they were not serving the jails and prisons, no one would be.
AT&T said they were more than happy to leave the corrections industry
business to 'the others'. The rate of fraud and other inappropriate calls
made from correctional center pay phones is astronomical.   PAT]

Chris.Farrarr@p1.f20.n246.z1.fidonet.org is right: it is not illegal to own

the US to listen to cellular phone calls with one, however.

I wonder if doing a statistical survey of cellular usage patterns, and
then selling it would be profiting from what you hear?  It would be
about the most accurate information I could imagine on phone usage 
patterns ...  without tapping in on inter-CO trunks.  Cellular
provides a skewed database, but the opportunity to sample randomly
within that database.

Not true.  First, you monitor the base station channels broadcasting 100W,
not the mobiles broadcasting max 3W.  So you hear the conversation
continuously while the "mobile" is in good contact with a particular base
station, which has a much better antenna/amplifier than your scanner.  Not
just while some car is driving past you.

And de facto, it seems well less than one in six calls does get handed
off.  This is based on listening to calls, (although I am not saying
it is me that did the listening.)  Some real fraction of the calls get
made with the mobile standing still.

And with good enough reception, you'd be able to scan and find the new
frequency of the same conversation at its next base station in a few
seconds of scanning.

Until digital, you should assume your call is being listened to on
cellular.  I predict legislation will not accomplish what digitization
and encryption will trivialize.

I ran into a couple of 203/860 split problems.  Being over-eager, I
tried stuff on August 27. I was able to dial my ISP's 860 pop from
203-426 fine.  But I could not dial the test number 1-860-203-0950.
It was apparently a translation problem in the 2B-ESS serving me.  It
was fixed by the time I got home today.

At work, I tried to call it and got an intercept.  Since my employer
does not use SNET for long distance, I dialed 00 and got a Sprint
operator.  I explained the problem.  She could not complete to the test
number either.  So a trouble report was filed.

I also tried AT&T, 10288-1-860-203-0950. Intercept.  Called AT&T operator.
She claimed 860-203 is not a valid exchange.  Explained the problem to a
supervisor.  She transferred me to repair.  Explained to her.  Apparently
SNET chose to put the test number in an NXX that was never used before,
and neglected to tell the industry.  

The moral of this story?  Make sure your LD carrier can route before you
suspect your PBX.  

IMHO, SNET's PR people got too fancy in selecting the test number.

The French are about to split their "0 + 1" area codes in five.  Ile
de France (greater Paris, code 1) stays the same but the rest of
France (which lacks area code) is divided in four quadrants.  I
haven't read about the details but this is of course a great chance to
set anything that mightn't be right right.

What?!  In Sweden phone numbers ranges from 0 + 7D to 0 + 9D and I've
never experienced any timeout problems.  Stockholm numbers (08) can be
six, seven or eight digits long.  In fact calls between AXE10 stations
(~90% of the subscribers) connect immediately after I've entered the
last digit regardless of if the called number is in Kiruna (1500 km
north of Stockholm) or to my mum four blocks away.

I applausd the concept of adding an extra digit when the area code has
been outgrown.  We've done that here over the last five years and it's
an excellent idea.  If BT had decided to add an extra digit to the old
London numbers (01) instead of splitting in 071 and 081 I guess
Londoners would be dancing in the streets right now.

A real example is the Swedish island of Gotland.  It used to be 0498
(west coast including Visby) and 0497 (the rest.  Visby was growing
"too much" so either a split of 0498 or longer numbers.  I guess in
this case 0499 could have been used but this is not always a possibility.  
Instead a 2 was added before the 0498 numbers and 0497 was merged with
0498.  Since then extra digits have been added before some of the old
five digit number series to make even more room.  Advantage; Gotland
became one code, most Gotlanders never call outside their island =>
shorter dialing on average.  No strange area code which didn't fit the
"hierarchy" had to be used.  And finally: it's so damned flexible!

>> *Distinctive non-geographic codes* so that anyone can tell

All GSM mobiles are in 070 (Telia Mobitel = 0705, Comviq = 0707,
Europolitan = 0708 etc) and all NMT mobiles are in 010.  However I did
count the different UK mobile prefixes and I found them to be 17, and
as someone stated earlier they're scattered all over the numbering
space.

Denmark, Norway, Finland are equally well organized.  Apart from that
I don't know except for Germany which I've heard is a great mess
because of some 20 million new citizens that came knocking on their
door a couple of years ago (former East Germany).

      In Southwestern Bell territory, 1+ was used in crossbar offices
long before there was any CAMA (centralized automatic message
accounting) which was required for toll dialing with step-by-step
switches.

      In Oklahoma, for historical reasons almost entirely step, when
conversions to common control (then #5 XB) offices began, most of them
went in with subscriber toll dialing.  Except for the first one or
two, 1+ was standard on all of them to identify a toll call.

      The curious result of this was that much of outstate Oklahoma
had toll dialing before Oklahoma City and Tulsa (which required CAMA
to serve their many step offices) and the usual question by customers
in Oklahoma City and Tulsa was not "what is DDD (Direct Distance
Dialing) and how does it work?" but "When are we going to get DDD?"

      One result was that when the CAMAs were turned up in Oklahoma
City and Tulsa, customer-dialed calls reached the projected one year
(or may be it was two year) percentage after one week.

      (Usually customer education and promotion was expected to be
required over many years to get people to use DDD; in Oklahoma City
and Tulsa the percentage of people who knew what DDD was and how to
use it was very high, since they already knew from friend, relatives
and business contacts in the outstate area.  As soon as they knew it
was available, they started using it.  Has quite an effect on the
loads and the facilities required.)

Subject: HELP on LD Directory Assistance Billing 


Can anyone shed some light as to the varies parts of LD Directory
Assistance charges? I once asked the question related to the tarrif
build-up, now with a credit I find I need to deal with two firms.

If I call NPA-555-1212 my IXC carrier charges me $.75. When I was
charged for two DA calls where they had no number to release to me, I
called to complain. I was offered an immediate "partial" credit but
was told I had to call Bell Atlantic for the credit of the remainder
of the charge. I was told this was necessary as the IXC had already
paid BA for that part of the call.

Can anyone help me understand the mechanics of the charging and then
billing for Directory Assistance calls. I have previously noted the
$.75 charge seems like an over-charge to me. In Pennsyvania a 411 call
costs $.25 to from a local phone. If I call 215-555-1212 from NJ I pay
the $.75 charge -- now if I was allowed to place a LD call to 215-411,
I'd save money. My LD rates is 15.5 cents during the day. Thus my call
to 215-411 (if it were allowed) would only cost 40.5 cents.

The two part credit I mentioned above drove me to consider why/how the
charge got to $.75 and which firms get what part of the money chain.

Anybody have any answers?


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: 555-1212 is treated like an 800 number in
the sense that the recipient of the call pays the charges, which would 
always be some telco somewhere. They have to pay your telco somewhere for
handling the call, and they want to make something for their own time and
effort as well, thus the various components of the overall (usually) 75
cent charge. I'm amazed they gave you any refund at all. The charge is 
*not* for providing you with information, it is for *seeking out* the 
information, if any exists. If none exists, too bad; they still spent their
time looking. On local directory assistance (411) that is certainly the
case. If you spend their time talking to them, you pay, regardless of
results.  PAT]

Subject: Hey AT&T, Tell Me How Much Your Services Cost!


Several days after receiving my AT&T calling card statement, I started
thinking about how much it really cost to to complete a call via my
AT&T calling card. I called the "800" number listed on the back of the
statement. I requested from the AT&T representative who answered a a
list of the various rates for completing a call on the AT&T network
with my AT&T calling card. He replied that there is no such list of
rates to send me.

I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor agreed, there is no
list of the type requested, that is, he agreed that I am supposed to
use my AT&T caling card to purchase a service from AT&T, but AT&T
isn't able to tell how much I'll pay.

Hey AT&T, are you listening? Tell me how your services cost! Thanks.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Generally the only difference in rates
is for the first minute and the calling card surcharge. The second and
subsequent minutes are billed at the same rate as if you had dialed the
call yourself from your home phone.  PAT]

Is there anyone who was able to find an inexpensive WATS extender?  I
have seen several posts here in the last few months, but heard nothing
of the results.

Hello Direct was of no help; the two people I spoke with laughed and
had no idea what I was talking about.  I'm looking for a simple way to
make local calls (as in local to the wats extender), utilizing my 800
number, while traveling.  I would prefer to have at least some
primitive security measures, but extra features aren't high priority.

Thanks for any leads or suggestions anyone can give me!

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  Those devices used to be a very important
part of life for business people who were out of the office all day since
they allowed one to dial into the office phone system and the connect with
the 'extender' and dial back out on the WATS line. But that was back in the
days when WATS (Wide Area Telephone Service) calls were almost as expensive
as DDD is now. Prices have gone down so much on long distance in the past
decade that devices like WATS extenders and other sorts of customer-owned
patch devices to put in the line have become almost obsolete.   PAT]

I have some switched 800 lines now dumping on a centrex hunt group (16
lines). I want to look at a T1 that replaces these switched lines
since it should result in lower cost per minute and some better
disaster recovery redirection options. What can I connect the T1 to
that will allow it to connect to 16 modems? I suspect there may be a
card that goes in a pc that can look like 23 or 24 analog lines. What
is it called and what might it cost? Who has such an animal? Any other
suggestions appreciated. I can use existing modem rack or am willing to
look at a new one if it fits the situation. All thoughts appreciated!

Tony seems to think that we who live in countries where variable
length local numbers are the norm (or at least were until recently)
spend our time waiting for "timeouts".  This is nonsense, and it
amazes me that people in the telecom industry can have such a
blinkered view of things (but then no wonder the NANP is such a mess)!
We *NEVER* have timeouts during dialing, not even for operator, nor do
we have to use the octothorpe key, so there is no "inconsistent
behaviour" either.

If you're in NANP then you already have "local" numbers in three
standard lengths (seven, ten and three) and it doesn't take a timeout
to distinguish them; consider this:

 *  Is there any timeout when you dial "911" before the switch decides that
    you aren't going to dial any more digits?  (There'd better not be!)
 *  Is there a timeout after you dial a 7-digit number before the switch
    decides you're not going to dial a 10-digit number? (No?)

Well, why should seven and eight digit versions of local numbers be
any harder to deal? As long as no short number ever forms a prefix for
any longer number, the switch can always tell how many more digits to
expect after the first few digits.

[I don't know, never having been there, but I would expect that even
in Germany where DDI numbers can have a variable length inward dialing
suffix, the PBX would know still when to initiate an immediate
connection because this no-prefix policy also applies to extension
numbers (eg no ordinary extension numbers start with a 0).  Can anyone
in +49 confirm or deny this?]

NANP got this badly wrong when they assigned 0 for operator and also
used it as a lead-in code for other functions, so now it needs a
timeout (or octothorpe) to distinguish them.

                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
That would be true if this were the case, but it is not; the reason that
mobile services have separate area codes here is exactly so the *caller* can
be billed for the call.  This is fairly common (although not universal)
outside NANP.  [For this, we get automatic full national coverage with a
flat-rate per minute; no "roaming" charges to the caller.]

There is something to be said for having all national numbers of a uniform 
length to avoid other countries having to maintain digit-length tables, but 
this doesn't constrain length-variability of local numbers.

Another mystery, why in NANP does a calling-card number *follow* the
phone number -- surely it's just a specialized version of carrier
selection?  Imagine having to dial carrier-selection 10XXX after the
number ...

Pressing octothorpe in the middle of a number here will definitely get
a disconnection; the only time I use it is when dialing internationally, 
as everything else goes through immediately.

Here's an unexpected twist:

With the new 360 area code now implemented in Washington state (carved
out of the 206 area code), there are now, of course, two area codes
serving the same area as was previously served by one.  If you are in
Seattle and want to call DA for someone's phone number in Olympia
(same LATA), you can't call 1-206-555-1212 anymore.  You have to dial
1-360-555-1212.  However, according to US West, all traffic to 360 DA
from the 206 area code must be routed on IEC lines, meaning no more DA
allowance for the calls, and a much higher cost (.95 for AT&T, for
example).  Interestingly, though, any "regular" toll calls between
Seattle and Olympia are automatically PIC'd to US West since it is
intralata (unless you override with 10-XXX).

If you are a USA long distance re-seller, we would consider your
services if you can save us money.

Here is what we *don't* want:

-to pay a monthly fee of any sort
-to be in the long distance business in order to get reduced rates
-T-1
-to sign a contract - you will keep us as long as you are cheapest
-a salesman who wants to analyze our bill.  I have done this myself and
know exactly what I am looking for.

Here is what we want:

-six second minimum on domestic calls
-six second billing on domestic calls
-no more than 30 second mimimum on international calls.
-T-1 rate range without the hassle of the equipment and fees.
-low international rates with a flat rate or two rate period plan.   But we
already get 1/2 off of MCI's best rates for six months, so you will have to
be really cheap on international to get our attention.

We spend around $10,000.00 per month on all aspects of our
telecommunications needs.  It is unlikely that you will get all of it,
but you may get a lot of it, depending on what you can do for us.

If you can meet the conditions we are looking for, we welcome your
pitch.  Make your pitch via email and if you have a good plan, I will
invite you to pitch me personally via phone.

I got my AT&T Wireless bill today. 

After AT&T bought McCaw, they were required to implement equal access
for long distance usage for their customers. A nice ballot went around
with three or four random picks for your LDC: AT&T, Access (in my
case), and some other nobody (Sprint, I think).

Not wanting to choose AT&T or Sprint, and being unable to select
Working Assets, I chose Access. I make no long distance calls, so it's
not an issue.

I mailed in my ballot. I got a call a few weeks later from AT&T asking
for my long distance carrier. I asked for a list; I chose Access,
again. She duly made typing noises and thanked me for my call.

I got a letter a few weeks later saying that if I didn't choose a long
distance company, my LD would be turned off. No loss, so I let it
pass. Besides, the nice lady had told me that there was a letter in
the mail and to ignore it. Cool.

Then I tried to make an LD call. Blocked. I call the 800 directory to
get Access's number; I call them. Never heard of me. "AT&T never tells
us anything; I don't think they send us our ballots". He does tell me
that I can use a code, however, to get around the tomfoolery and make
an LD call. It's a secret, though, don't tell anyone (by now, I was
drooling). "Just type 102 881 and the phone number you want, sir."

WHOA! He gave me *AT&T*'s PIC. That was funny. I asked if they had
one, (a PIC); he said he didn't know. He did say to call the same
number next week during 8-5 hours and talk to Access.

I did. The lady I talked to was very helpful, but she said I would
need to perform the switch by calling AT&T and having it done. I did.

Today I got my bill. A nice insert telling me CNID delivery will start
soon for TDMA customers (Hooray!) and on page 5, under "Airtime and
long distance charges",

"Your selected long distance company is ACCESS LD."

THEY GOT IT RIGHT! But wait. On page 11, it says (for my old phone
number)

"You have not chosen a long distance company. Please make your
selection today."

AHHHH the light goes on! I changed my MIN some time ago. My account
number stayed stable, but they apparently tacked my LD info onto the
new account. Apparently, the switch (or some item in the loop) checks
the first account on the MIN for LD access choice. Which, for me, on
that number, would be nobody.

Uh, can we say, bogus? I tried (just now) to make an LD call. I got an
intercept from Access saying I needed to activate my account. Great!

This brings to mind an story which happened in 1987, when I was trying
to figure out a cheap way of dialing into my IBM mainframe from home
using a 300-bps async modem and a VT100 emulator. IBM communication
front-end processors at the time knew only a few protocols -- the
proprietary Bisync and SDLC being the most popular -- and the IBM 3270
terminal was king. When I asked my old-school IBM Systems Engineer if
the mainframe could communicate with an async terminal such as the DEC
VT100, he responded as if I were referring to some virulent disease.
"Oh, you mean yer Twix terminals -- like start/stop."  At that time,
async terminals could not operate with the mainframe in full-screen
video mode -- only in line mode.  Async was supported only enough to
make somebody's teletypes work in some obscure application.  As far as
IBM was concerned, "TWX" and "start/stop" were the complete definition
of async.

Cross Country Wireless Cable has 18" dishes on subscribers roofs, they
have done a real bang up job of draining the cable companies in this
area. The cities don't like it much either since they can't collect
franchise fees. There will be no need for wires in this area, at least
it sure does not appear like it will. In Palm Springs a company has
built a whole new CO and several companies have asked for co-location
in our CO's. This really is going to be interesting. If all are equal
players then you may wind up getting your phone and cable servce from
the phone companies, since many plan on buying the others.

Subject: Telephone Numbers Used in Entertainment Fiction
Date: 1 Sep 1995 13:32:34 GMT
Organization: Tulane University


Carl Moore's recent article in TD about the telephone numbers in I Love Lucy
brought to mind some of what my subject line states.

AT&T/Bell-System/Western-Electric print/magazine ads back in the later
1940's and most of the 1950's in {Time, Life, National Geographic,
etc} frequently showed a picture of a WE #202 or #302 (or later #500)
style telephone. The number card *always* stated the number MAin-0-2368. 
The use of a '0' (zero) was RARELY used in practice as the third digit
in locations with '2L-5N' local numbering. [New Orleans had WHitehall-0 
only VERY BRIEFLY in 1959/60, assigned not within the other 'WHitehall' 
region, but adjacent to it in then undeveloped but growing New Orleans
East. WHitehall-0 was a small step office in a house trailer, while
CHestnut-2's building to house New Orleans' very first #5XB exchange
was being constructed. The reason that '0' zero was not recommended in
exchange name days was that in the US/Canada, the Letter O is
associated with the digit 6-MNO, and there could be customer dialing
confusion.]

Back in the 1930's and earlier 40's, the Bell ad's telephones had the
number CHElsea-2368. Sometime in the very late 1950's or very early
1960's, the telephone number on the 500 series and Princess phones
(and keysets, business phones, 'card-dialers', etc) in AT&T print ads
was changed to KL5-2368 or "Area Code 311, KL5-2368". Only letters
were shown for the Exchange Name.  Later on, the number was (311) 555-
2368. 311 has never been an Areacode in North America, but reserved
for *local* service code uses. Many locations used N11 codes for
ringback, testing, ANAC, etc, as well as 211 for Long Distance Opr,
411 for Information, 611 Repair, 811 Business Office, and later 911
for Emergencies. Letters for 55X are hard to compose a name, other
than possibly KLondike (which was used in San Francisco in the old
days). There are no vowels on the '5'. Most Bell telcos used 55 or 55X
for test numbers, and I remember seeing something in "Notes on
Nationwide Dialing" (AT&T, 1955) that 55X, 57X, 95X and 97X were going
to be reserved for dialing mobile radiotelephones in the future.

Many older Radio, TV and Movie fiction/drama/etc. used actual exchange
names of the town/city the play took place in. (I Love Lucy used
MUrray-Hill, CIrcle, etc; the CBS Suspense radiodrama 'Sorry Wrong
Number' used PLaza, TRafalgar, MUrray-Hill, and for the time-of-day
recording, MEridien-x-1212!)  If the location itself was fictitious,
well then the exchange names were 'generic'. Sometimes, fictitious/generic 
exchange names were used for real locations. Many times, the Hollywood
producers co-operated with telco, but at times they didn't. If they
co-operated, the last four digit line numbers quoted in fiction were
usually from the 9XXX series, sometimes even 99XX series. The
9-thousands were frequently used for payphones, test numbers, and
non-assigned numbers specifically reserved for fictitious purposes. I
would guess that today, Hollywood doesn't *always* use the 555.

The early 1960's NBC-TV series "HAZEL" had a very amusing telephone
episode in its first season (61/62), [the first season was in Black-and-
White, while the remainder of its run was in Color]. The Baxters were
getting sick and tired of receiving telephone sales calls at all hours
of the day or night.  [The word telemarketing wasn't used at that
time, tho']. They decided to change their listed number to a non-published 
number. Telco mailed them the number card with the new non-pub number
along with a letter stating when their new number would take effect.
However, someone accidently lost or discarded the numbercard before
anyone had a chance to note it down! The old and new telephone numbers
were referred to as "KLondike-5" xxxx. The camera close up on the
number card showed KL5-xxxx. The numericals of KL5 are, of course,
555!

The episode, "Night Call" from TWILIGHT ZONE in its fifth season,
1963/64 was about an old woman receiving strange calls in the middle
of the night during a thunderstorm. She had a WE #202 phone, and the
numbercard showed KL5-xxxx.

Most TV shows began to use the fictitious KL5 or 555 sometime in the
early 1960's, but when areacodes were quoted, they usually used a real
one.  Sometimes, if a location was a fictitious one, they would use
311 for the areacode, just like Bell's magazine/print ads in the
1960's-on.

I was told that San Francisco never had a KLondike-5 (or any name for
555) back in the exchange name days, altho' they did have other
KLondike-x exchanges. I also remember seeing late 1950's Bell
journals/magazines describing a 'future' way to customers to direct
dial to Information (Directory Assistance) outside of your home area.
The 555-1212 was referred to as "KLondike-5-1212" in some of those
Bell journals!

I am not quite sure what to say about Harrison's book, but one thing I
*do* know -- it's unique.
 
The first two chapters give a very sound overview of what Usenet news
is, and how it works.  Chapters three to six, and a part of chapter
eight, give some instruction on reading news with nn, tin, gnus,
Trumpet Newsreader and Netscape.  Posting is covered in chapter seven,
while eight to ten cover miscellaneous advanced topics.  Chapter
eleven, somewhat oddly, talks about email.  Appendices include a table
of geographic distribution limiters, five good (and classic) articles
on Usenet UNIX wildcards and regular expressions, sources for the
software described in the book, and the Spafford/Lawrence lists of
groups and alt groups.
 
The material is clear and easy to read.  It does, however, have
something of a "techie" feel, confirmed by the suggestion that
programming your own newsreader is a good way to learn news, or the
directions for WAIS indexing of articles.  The organization is
generally good, but could be improved or enhanced with
cross-references.  For example, chapter seven tells you not to post an
article until you've read the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions
list)--but doesn't tell you about the MIT mail-server source for FAQs
until chapter eight.  Some of the content is much more comprehensive,
such as the excellent collection of hoax messages that shouldn't be
reposted.  On the other hand, as useful as they might be in general,
do we really need a chapter on email, most of one on ftp, and an
appendix on UNIX wildcards?  That space might better be used for
missing information such as mail-to-news gateways.  (A sidebar does
describe anonymising servers.  And the Usenet FAQ in Appendix B lists
one--the Digital site which is now permanently out of service.)  The
material on newsreaders could be expanded either to include more of
them, or more details.
 
For anyone wanting to become involved with the thousands of topical
discussions ongoing under Usenet news technology, this book will get
you started and *won't* steer you wrong.  It is written by someone who
firmly understands the Usenet culture, and Valerie Quercia's frequent
sidebars provide interesting comments along the way.  Harrison's topic
choices may be technical, but his explanations are not.  This book can
be for anyone.

Description:

   A fresh look at the multifaceted aspects of the network design
   problem is required in an era of increased competition and rapidly
   changing technology supporting new services.  The skills and 
   knowledge of the network designer must be founded upon a solid
   engineering and mathematical basis combined with a systems
   view of the problem.  John Yanosy will discuss this system view
   of the network design problem and some of the design aspects that
   a network designer faces in this environment.  Perspectives will be
   drawn from experiences in designing and planning for high speed
   enterprise data networks to the newer aspects of multimedia
   networks as well as the significant opportunities that ATM and
   SONET offer.

Speaker: John Yanosy, Technical Director at SNET

   John has over 24 years of engineering experience characterized by
   an interdisciplinary, holistic approach to system design and
   analysis.  He has been involved with: network service and 
   technology planning and assessment, system design including
   protocol architecture development, protocol development, software
   development, real time packet switching design, mathematical 
   analysis and computer simulation of large scale parallel
   computer architectures.  In addition, he also has experience in 
   hands on development of products that were manufactured and 
   sold.  He is currently working on SNET's Interactive Digital
   Video Tone Network.  This involves exploring alternative
   broadband network architectures and their sensitivity to
   technology and market parameters.

This Meeting Is Being Presented By The Computer Society.

MultiFunction Peripheral Association to Host Major Developer
and Standards Conference, September 28-29 in Del Mar, California.

Michael J. Miller, Editor-in-Chief of PC Magazine, to Keynote Event.

SAN DIEGO, CA / August 30, 1995 - The MultiFunction Peripheral
Association (MFPA) and PC Magazine today announced that Michael J.
Miller, Vice President and Editor-in Chief of PC Magazine and
well-known computer industry spokesperson, had been named as the
keynote speaker for the MFPA's upcoming "Integrated Office Conference
'95" (IOC '95). The event is scheduled for September 28 and 29 at the
Del Mar Hilton in Del Mar, California and is expected to draw over 200
top computer development professionals, marketers and executives.

Held in cooperation with the Telecommunications Industry Association
(TIA) and Business Technology Association (BTA, formerly NOMDA/LANDA),
the Integrated Office Conference '95 will offer critical technical and
strategic information about the design and development of multifunction 
peripherals (MFP's or products that combine fax, data transfer,
scanning, copying and/or printing features in one unit) as well as
stand-alone products that need to communicate with such products. IOC
'95 will also provide a forum for product development professionals to
directly influence proposed industry standards for MFP's.

The conference features a full range of seminars, presentations, panel
discussions and speeches as well as hosted meals and special events.
Three tracks of eighteen sessions covering technical, light technical
and marketing/channel issues are scheduled.

Also planned are presentations and discussions of the MFPA's own
Multifunction Peripheral Interface (MFPI) standard; which has been
accepted by the TIA as its interim standard IS-650.  Designed to
facilitate communications between MFP's as well as for compatibility
with popular network and operating system architectures, the MFPI
standard promises to make multifunction products easier to develop,
less expensive and more compatible across a wide range of platforms.

The registration fee for the MFPA Integrated Office Conference '95 is
$595 for MFPA members and $695 for non-members.  Admission includes
access to all conference sessions, continental breakfasts, a hosted
luncheon, networking receptions, a "Del Mar-garita" party plus a
complete conference binder. Audio transcriptions will also be
available for most conference sessions. Discounts are available for
multiple registrations.

IOC '95 will be held at the new Del Mar Hilton located next to the Del
Mar Racetrack and Fairgrounds (just minutes from the city of San Diego
and the world famous beaches of Del Mar and La Jolla). Special
below-season room rates are available for the event.

Hey Y'all:

I am currently doing some planning studies for some software design
and I need to have an idea of CENTREX penetration in various
industries (I.E.  Heathcare and Hopsitals Centrex has XX% share of the
market).  I am also interested in your general opinions and thought on
why CENTREX service would be better than a PBX (RBOC Marketing whizzes
this means you!)  If you have information or suggesstions why a PBX is
a superior choice "on the average" I would love to hear that as well.

Please send any relevant data to mth@indy.net.

Subject: Last Laugh! International Phone Ripoff Chain Letter Spam


Here's a slightly edited version of a message that fell into my
mailbox this morning.  It's a unique combination of all of the most
annoying new developments in telecom:

* a usenet spam
* a chain letter
* a pay-per-call disguised as an international call

The number is in the Seychelles, a small island nation off the east
coast of Africa whose main income comes from European and South
African tourism.  I hadn't heard of them getting into rebate phone
numbers before, but the rates from here to there are plenty high to
support this sort of nonsense -- my long distance company's off-peak
rate is $3.32/min with a 30 second minimum.

 ---spam follows---

Subject: Make thousands of dollars EASY!!! NOT a chainletter!!!

Here's how:

*  Call 011-24-831-3131
*  Wait for a beep, press 1
*  Repeat last step
*  Listen to recorded message and follow instructions
*  When asked for account number, enter 000000 [actual number was here]

Here's how it works: When you call and enter my ID number, I will be
given 50 cents. But then, the person who calls also gets their own ID
number so that they can advertise the number and have people call it
so they can start making thousands too! So don't waste time and call
TODAY!!

Also, please don't post a follow up, since its a massive cross-post.

[PS to Pat, this was never actually posted to the net, since one of the
groups he cross-posted to was the moderated comp.compilers, and I forwarded
it to his postmaster so they can cancel his account].

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I love it!  This has got to be one of the
best ones yet ... the nineties version of an old chain letter that's been
making the rounds for at least fifty years: send me money and add your 
name to the bottom of the list so people can send you money also. But
John, you should not tamper with important news articles like that which
are sent to Noisenet. You should do like I do: carefully remove your own
name from the newsgroups line (and as a courtesy, any other moderated
groups you see there which may cause the distribution process to stall)
then feed it all back into the news stream again so that others can share 
in the wisdom presented. My sincere belief is that if the spams become
massive enough in their distribution, and ridiculous enough in their premise,
it will bring a halt to this form of communication once and for all.  PAT]

Subject: Boston Area Telephone Exchange Name History


Since other contributors have recently provided information about the
histories of the Chicago and New Orleans telephone systems, I decided
to do a listing of exchanges for central offices located within 10
miles of Boston in 1959, the year before all-number calling made it's
debut in this area. Since I now live more than 1000 miles from Boston,
I do not have the opportunity to visit a public library to obtain
information from old telephone books. All of the information below
comes from my memory and a list of current ANIs for the area.

In 1948, exchange names went from three letters to two letters and one
number.  For example CAPitol became CApitol 7. This allowed New
England Telephone to use the same exchange name with several suffix
numbers.

Some Boston exchange names came from the history of the area which is
also the story of the beginnings of the United States.  Since Boston
was the birthplace of the telephone (and the original headquarters
city of AT&T), some exchanges were named after telephone pioneers.

It is also interesting to know that sections of the City of Boston,
have a seperate telephone identity. A long distance call made to the
Roxbury section of the city (only three miles from downtown) will be
billed as a call to Roxbury, not to Boston.  This is also true for
calls made to Dorchester, West Roxbury, Hyde Park, Brighton, Charlestown, 
South Boston, and East Boston.

Satellite Digital Broadcasting to Launch in Japan

By Noriko Takezaki

On August 29, a satellite is scheduled to be launched from Cape
Canaveral, in the U.S., bearing the hopes of the Japanese for the
country's first satellite digital broadcasting, the much anticipated
ISDB (integrated services digital broadcasting) which will help
realizing the convergence of communications and broadcasting.

A subsidiary of Japan Satellite Systems Inc. (JSAT), DMC Corp., is to
inaugurate satellite digital broadcasting next year via the eight
transponders of JSAT's satellite, JCSAT-3. The broadcasting with about
50 channels is scheduled to start in April, with full-scale
broadcasting service commencing in Autumn next year.

"Japan is just about to catch up with the world's trend toward digital
broadcasting," said Mr. Ken Churiki, vice president of DMC. "Our
objective is to realize digital broadcasting services with much higher
quality than our forerunners elsewhere in the world."

DMC, originally established in 1994 as DMC Planning Co., Ltd. in
preparation of the digital broadcasting business, decided to move to
an operating company last July to become a service provider of
satellite digital broadcasting. In accordance with its shift to being
a service provider, DMC increased its operating capital to =B41
billion, and plans to further increase this to about =B410 billion by
the next year. DMC's stocks are commonly shared with five companies,
each holding 20%: JSAT and four major general trading companies
including Itochu Corp., Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Nissho Iwai Corp., and
Sumitomo Corp.

While the uplink service of the satellite is handled by JSAT, DMC will
offer satellite digital broadcasting with about 50 channels of
programming initially. These services include scrambling and its key
control, billing and production of electronic program guide (EPG) and
promotion channel. DMC plans to increase the number of channels up to
100 in the future, upon consideration of market needs.

For possible competition with other broadcasting services, DMC aims at
"coexistence with cable TV for the realization of multichannel and
multimedia services with entirely new concepts," according to Mr.
Churiki.  Targeting mainly non-cable TV home-passed households, DMC
expects to acquire nearly two million subscribers, about 7% of
non-cable TV home-passed households, by the year 2000.

Regarding another possible competitor, BS (Broadcasting Satellite)
services, DMC itself doesn't feel menaced by it. "Because we think
digital broadcasting is an entirely new service beyond the
conventional concept of broadcasting," said Mr. Churiki. "This is a
means of multichannel and multimedia services."

For the realization of satellite digital broadcasting, MPT's advisory
body, the Telecommunications Technology Council (TTC), took action in
late July to facilitate the production of satellite digital
broadcasting systems. TTC submitted to the MPT minister a partial
report on technical requirements for the systems, such as for
information coding systems (encoding of video and sound programs),
channel coding, modulation, framing structure and scrambling system.

In the TTC's recommendation, the information coding systems are to
adopt MPEG-2 which was standardized by the ITU. Scrambling systems are
unified so as to secure compatibility among receiving equipment, while
key control system for scrambling is open. Channel coding, modulation
and framing are to adopt the QPSK (quadrature phase shift keying)
system used by the European DVB.

In accordance with the TTC's recommendation, MPT has started working
on for establishment of related ministerial ordinances to allow
commercialization of the satellite digital broadcasting in April next
year.  And major consumer electronics companies, like Sony, Toshiba
Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., have started
development of receiving terminals and other required equipment for
satellite digital broadcasting to be in time for the service start.

Satellite digital broadcasting is, therefore, almost ready to launch
here technically. However, there is still a concern: whether there are
sufficient number of programs to attract many people. Toward this
concern, DMC is optimistic. "Possibility (of producing good quality
programs) itself is quite strong," says Mr. Churiki. "The point is to
make specified, segmented, and well-targeted programs. Like magazines,
if the contents are interesting, there is always room for new stuff."

For the concern regarding contents production and application
development, MPT also offers help. MPT is scheduled to establish the
Digital Broadcasting Center (tentative name) within this fiscal year
to help potential service providers acquire knowledge and expertise of
digital broadcasting technology, and to encourage more people to enter
this field.

"This is the field people in the industries expect much," says Mr.

Subject: Get Busy and Forward to Yourself
Date: 5 Sep 1995 03:57:29 -0700
Organization: CR Labs


For the first time since 1975, it is now possible to set up call
forwarding to you own number.  This may sound like a "so what?" kind
of thing, but from the standpoint of 1ESS/1AESS sanity it is
significant.

I should point out that this has become possible in Atlanta because of
the upcoming split of the 404 NPA into 404/770.  And from the CO's
standpoint your are not forwarding to your own seven digit number
(that is still not possible), but rather to 404 + your seven digit
number.  I can call another number in my CO with seven digits, and the
call stays in my CO.  If I prepend a 404 to it, it goes out to the
LATA tandem and comes back.

The net result is that you make your line busy, and you get a reminder
ring every time someone calls your number.  This can be handy.

Now for the folklore.

In 1974 it *was* possible to set up call forwarding to your own seven
digit number in a 1ESS.  Back then generics went by the designation
"Centrex 2" as opposed to the current "1AE12" type of designation.  I
have no idea what generic my CO was running in 1974.

So after you set up forwarding to yourself, you were able to have some
real fun.  At least to a nineteen-year-old phone nut it was fun <G>.

If you called your number during the day, you got a *long* audit.  No
doubt a bunch of stuff spewed out of the model 33 maintenance terminal
at the CO, and the poor CO tech probably said something like "oh s**t,
its him again".  I think at times this may have caused a phase, but I
can't prove it.

After 6 PM, when you called your number you got sent off to AIS.  The
remarkable thing is that the number AIS read back was the number of
the last call processed by the 1ESS!  So you could amuse yourself for
hours by getting some *serious* SMDR from your serving CO.

I am told this bug had something to do with pointers to route index
zero.  Perhaps David G. can shed some light on why this happened.

BTW, this same generic allowed *free* IDDD calls from payphones.  I
made lots of friends in England that year :-)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The early ESS we had in Chicago back
in the middle 1970's also had bugs, but I don't think it ever allowed
you to forward to yourself; I can't remember. I do know one thing back
then disallowed was 'chain forwarding'. A could forward to B and B could
in turn forward to C; no matter, persons calling A *always* stopped at
B regardless of what B was doing. At the same time, calls to B would
always be forwarded to C. The theory was that B has the right to have his
calls forwarded to C if desired, however he has no right to speak for 
what A wants done with his. Now this is assuming all three parties A, B,
and C were on the same switch of course. The switch definitly knew how
B came to receive the call in question (whether to forward it per B's
instructions or drop it on B regardless). On calls that left the switch
however, things were different.  Our first ESS here was on the 'near north
side' in 1972. The first ESS downtown came in 1973 with the cutover of a
very antiquated stepping switch. They got rid of it first and left the
crossbar (which was still in reasonably good condition) for later. 

Opening day of the first ESS for downtown: I had WEbster-9-4600 in my
office; the nearby Sears, Roebuck store with the national Sears credit
card office in the same building on State Street had WAbash-2-4600. I
had a mere two line installation with a single phone with a turn button
for the two lines; Sears had a five position manual cordboard which
rocked around the clock literally; thousands of calls daily to the
credit office, etc. Guess what?  In the conversion process, someone got
their translations wrong, with calls to 922-anything actually winding up
on 939-the-same.  For two days running, my phone rang continuously with
people trying to get Sears. I would hang up on one wrong number and the
phone would ring again instantly. I must have gotten a couple thousand
calls, and no doubt Sears did not notice anything wrong at all. Once I
got through to repair service they promised to look into it right away
and they did fix it. A lot of 939 customers were affected, especially
those with numbers which related to *large* subscribers on 922 including
the Hilton Hotel (4400), the Chicago Police Administrative Offices (4747)
and Western Union (4321 for general offices, 7111 for message taking
operators). After moving out of that office downtown, I went several years
with crossbar service until about 1983 when Chicago-Rogers Park finally
got cut over.  PAT]

I am working on an ISDN project to build an interface for a PABX.  I
don't need any of the fancy features that can be implemented with
other ISDN protocols.

I need the Q.931 (or I.451) series recommendation which is the ISDN user-

The ITU has a server with the Q and I series recommendations on it but
I can't seem to find the Q.931. I got the listserver to send me a Road
Map which is a couple months old and has Q.931 on it. But when I
request the file from the server it says that it can't fint it. I then
e-mail it for a listing of the Q-series directory but the Q.931 does
not have any file associated with it or a file reference number. I
have also not received any replies that I asked the listserver to
forward to the staff.

Could someone who possibly has the Q.931 specification or downloaded it 
previously please e-mail to me.

Subject: Names For That Key Under the 9
Date: Tue, 5 Sep 1995 10:45:57 NZST


I have two questions:

(1) how many different names are used for the octothorpe key; so far
    I've heard:

        cross-hash key
        cross-hatch key
        enter key
        hash key
        noughts-and-crosses key
        number-sign key
        octothorpe key
        pound key
        pound-sign key

    Anyone add to this list?

(2) what is the derivation for the term "pound key", since the symbol on
    telephones bears no similarity to that used for British currency.

    I would hazard to guess that the answer to this derives from confusion
    over the standard computer character set used in the UK, which differs
    from ASCII by only one character, decimal 35.  Then when asked "what is
    the symbol `#' called in the UK"...  (Of course, this is merely
    speculation on my part; maybe there's a better answer.)

Subject: Voting by Phone in the Netherlands


Every four year there are elections in the Netherlands, and because of
different reasons (bad weather or having to work) many people never
even bother to go to the polling booth. In order to make voting easier
the Dutch government made it possible last year for people who live in
the city of Utrecht to vote at the railway station, so they would be
able to do it on their way to work. Yet, many people don't travel by
train to work, and even if they do, they might not have the time at
the railway station to stand in line. Therefor the government is
currently considering the option of voting by phone. People who decide
to vote by phone will have to call a special access number.  The
number will be one of a 06 (900 type) kind, leading to the call
factory in Rotterdam. The call factory is a special exchange for
handling up to 1,6 million phone calls an hour.  At this moment most
time is invested in making sure the system is safe, and fraud will not
be possible.  If this system is going to be used in the future, the
Netherlands will be the first country to make televoting for
parliamentary elections possible.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Suggestions -- and for that matter, full-
bodied, substantial proposals -- regarding 'vote by phone' have been
made here in the USA also, but nothing has come of it. All the usual
excuses ('there would be too much fraud', etc) have been tossed out as
reasons it would not work, even though fraud prevention techniques have
been provided.  Then there were the privacy freaks who insisted that
the tighter the fraud controls, the more likely there would be massive
invasions of privacy in the 'voting booth' if controls were established
identifying the phone number being used and some other personal identifier
such as social security number, etc. They can't seem to understand that
there *are* ways to identify the user and validate his *right to vote*
without necessarily examining the vote being cast. Nor can they seem to
understand that there are competent programmers who share a love for
their country and a sense of patriotism which would develop the needed
software in an instant -- as fraud-proof and fool-proof as the present
manual system if not more so -- if it meant that more Americans would
participate in the process. They would do so with a sense of integrity
and ethics which would *never* willfully violate anyone's privacy. 

Even starting on a small scale for 'beta testing' purposes seems to be
out of the question. The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners (an
independent government agency responsible for administering elections of
all sorts within the city) has been shown how telephone voting, either
with modem and computer or by touch tone buttons alone) would work quite
well. They have been shown how, with the cooperation of the banking 
network, voting could be done at any ATM machine. Of course *not everyone*
has an ATM card, and of course *not everyone* has a computer and modem,
but these would be two additional ways of 'getting out the vote'. They
have been shown how even in conventional voting booth arrangements, a
terminal hooked to their central computer could be used to eliminate a
huge amount of manual tabulating required, and the fraud that can accompany
same, to say nothing of being able to eliminate many of the 'middle-man'
election judges found at each polling place. 

They'll hear none of it ... which is odd, considering how desparate they
are getting to find voters these days. They do registrations now at all
sorts of places -- even at the Cook County Jail where they always get
*thousands* of voters each year for selected candidates -- just to round
up anyone they can who is willing and wants to bother to vote. They keep
harping on the fraud problem using phone voting, but believe me you, 
nothing compares to the fraud we have here now with the crooked election
judges and the low-level Democratic politicians who hang around the
polling places on election day, bringing in voters by the bus load from
old-people's homes, etc. We could have had tele-voting here years ago had
they wanted it. As they say in Chicago, 'vote early and often!'   PAT]

I was in Los Angeles the other day and attempted to use the Pacific Bell
payphone located inside the restaurant where I was eating lunch.  My
pager had just gone off, telling me I had a voice mail message waiting.

However, after I dialed any number on this phone, the touch-tone pad
was shut off.  I expect this kind of behavior from COCOTs, but not from
P*B phones.

I called the telco to complain and they explained to me that this was
done purposely because that telephone is in "a high-crime area".  So
what am I supposed to do?  Hit the streets in this "high-crime area" to
find a COCOT that will let me check my voice mail?  And how many crimes
do you think the disabling of those touch-tone pads has averted?

If I really thought that this action was helping the local community I
might understand.  But it just seems to be so much of a meaningless
action that does nothing but inconvenience the honest citizen.

I'm not sure I follow Patrick's argument, although it's clear he
has good knowledge of the situation in Illinois.  From experience
traveling around the nation, not only talking about payphones but
actually trying to use them (my current business is very dynamic
and I call from everywhere, all the time), I think the California
situation is more typical.

Of course, this brings to the fore, once again, the arbitrariness of
regulation and policy in a regime which is totally and unreasonably
fractured.  In this environment it is difficult, if not impossible,
for citizens to reasonably share knowledge across boundaries between
corporate fiefs, let alone do anything about it.

In a footnote to a previous posting, Patrick levels the boom on Judge
Greene for compelling the breakup of the AT&T Bell System, presumably
on its current lines.

As one who was involved, working for a state government policy body
at the time, I cannot imagine a more distorted picture of what occurred.

The AT&T diversiture case had been running for years before it reached
a head in Judge Greene's court.  As I recall quite clearly, the
Justice Department under Reagan, in the person of its antitrust
assistant secretary, went and cut a very private deal with AT&T's
executives.  What had started as a proceeding to divest AT&T of its
manufacturing facilities turned into a dissection of the national
network, because at that time AT&T perceived its future to lie with
long-distance, not local service.  We (in the policy realm) were all
stunned to see the settlement drawn up in that fashion, as it
obviously had not been the goal of the proceedings before the
Justice-AT&T huddle.  Judge Greene's later amendments to the Consent
Decree were trivial compared to this basic structural deviation from
what preceded it.

Patrick may not have liked Judge Greene's self-referential method of
governing the Decree, once it was drawn up, but revising history to
cast more aspersions on him only has the effect of letting the real
culprits off the hook.  I can't imagine this as Patrick's goal.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: An article in the {Chicago Sun Times} on 
Monday, Labor Day, discussed how bad the situation is getting here in
certain neighborhoods. There are areas you can go on the west side of
Chicago for several blocks without finding a payphone, and then when
you do find one, it is out of order. The article said hundreds of outside
payphones have been removed in poorer, minority neighborhoods as part of
the war on drugs. The rule now is there can no longer be payphones in
or around liquor stores as well, since these were used by 'gang members'.
The odd part is, they still have lots of payphones in the Board of Trade
Building and up and down LaSalle Street in the financial district downtown,
and those people use illegal drugs also. They have payphones all over 
City Hall as well, and the gang which owns that turf has been known on
occassion to use something other than Bayer Asprin.

today and want to stay that way. <grin>   PAT]

Uh, I've been known to play occasionally in Las Vegas and since the 1970's

pay phone, real or cocot, that intentionally keeps coins on an incomplete 
call.  (Or at least more of them there than anywhere else. ;-)
 
#include <info about supervision and ring tone detection>
 
One ironic thing that I find in one hotel where we frequently stay, they
have a flat $.50 per day for all the local calls you can eat, but zing you
$.75 for an 800 call.  I find myself using the room phone for local calls
and the lobby pay phone for 800 calls.
 
Funny thing I've found out about pay phones in LV, at least a few years
back, is that the real ones tended to be non-Bell and those that looked
like genuine ones were almost always cocots.

Ameritech has recently changed all of its payphones to no longer allow
customers to call pager/voice mail boxes for FREE anymore.  It now requires
a 35 cent deposit.  Ameritech did this with no forewarning whatsoever, even
to the resellers to re-sell the pager products.

Can Ameritech go do this?  We had many un-happy customers, and we didn't
have a good answer to provide them with.  Currently were offering our
customers a $0.179 calling card which is billed in 6 second increments.
This wasn't the best answer, but at least the customers don't have to give
Ameritech the 35 cents.

Has anyone else been faced with this type of problem?

What do you mean here?  There is no NANP calling card format.  I think
you are talking about LEC calling cards which (usually) mean
NPA-NXX-XXXX YYYY where YYYY is the PIN.  It has nothing to do with
carrier selection; in fact, the call will be placed over the carrier
that that particular phone is presubscribed to (unless that carier
doesn't accept LEC cars - unlikely).

Most IXC calling cards are not composed of a particular phone number,
though you can have the card number reflect your home number, since it
is usually possible to choose the number.

Maybe I have read the wrong thing into descriptions which of activities that 
describe dialing 0 + 10D + code?  Does this not mean "dial 0 then the
number you wish to reach then your activation code", or have I got it
wrong?  Even the "Bit-Fax" software (from USA) has that as the default
order ...

Maybe I've got the wrong term when I say "calling card"; that is just the
generic term which is applied here to the concept I thought I was referring
to.

You have a point that it doesn't alter the default carrier that a particular
phone is presubscribed to, but it is a payment authorisation, and that is
what I was trying to get at.

It doesn't just follow the phone number, it follows the handoff (if
any) to the long distance carrier.  (Which, among other things, means
that if you are using pulse dialing you have to switch to tone to
enter the card number.)  When this system came into use in the 1970s
it was the only way to do it without a *lot* of reworking in
step-by-step and crossbar central offices, and today it probably has
value in preventing hanky-panky on the part of the local phone
companies (since they don't have to decode and pass on the card
numbers, there's no opportunity to capture them for other uses).

Do we talk about department numbers as found on motor cars or about
phone numbers?

Departement numbers are somewhat alphabetical, from 01 Ain to 89 Yonne,
plus 90 Belfort for historical reasons and the new 91-95 departments
which once were parts of the Seine (which includes only Paris now).
Add one or two oddities (Corse: 20 splitted into 2A and 2B,
Yvelines 78 which was Seine et Oise in the past), and that's it.

Phone area codes *were* somewhat geographical: they were two digit codes,
with the 2x assigned to the North, 3x to Normandy, 4x to the West, 5x to
South-West, 6x to South, 7x to Rhone-Alps, 8x to the East, and 9x divided
between Riviera and Brittany.

A phone number was then: (AB) PQ MC DU (AB was the departement code,
PQ the central office, and MCDU stands for milliers, centaines, dizaines, 
unites: thousands, hundreds, tenths, units)

But they had to split some areas that were assigned to two or more
departements when these departements grew more than predicted.  (79
was assigned to both Savoie and Haute Savoie: Haute Savoie received
50, formerly Vendee, although it was in the 7x area...). 

Then these two digit codes were integrated into the national phone
number, and two areas were introduced: 1 for the Parisian area and *no
code* for the rest of France.  A phone number is now: (Z) AB.PQ.MC.DU

Next year they will anew introduce geographical area codes, 0x, with x
being 1 for Paris, 2 to 5 for North, West, South, East of France, 6 to
8 for special purposes (mobiles, freephone, etc).

So, if you know a bit of history and geography, you can tell where a
number is!  (Well, perhaps not anybody could :-)

No problem, except that the digit supervision is defined in the switch
you are connected to, not the switch at the far end.

Not from here, but there are two ways this can work:

1) Get a speech path to the PBX and then dial your additional digits;
or

2) Define either fixed (with additional analysis) or variable (with
timeout) length numbers in *ALL* exchanges where the PBX could be
called from, and that's a lot op places ...

OK, but for every country any variable length national numbers will
invariably mean variable length international ones as well. ie in the
UK we have a mix of 10 and 11 digit national numbers, and that means
that +44 can be followed by either 9 or 10 digits!!

This means that for calls to the UK, either the shorter number length
has to time out, or analysis has to be done at the next digit - which
is another ten lines of data to maintain in every switch worldwide
that supports international dialing!

I think that's exactly the key reason that the group in charge doesn't
want it.  They probably believe that the persons most likely to own
computers, modems, touch-tone phones, and ATM cards are also more
likely to be affluent, educated, and concerned individuals.  Making it
easier for more of them to vote (as opposed to the poor, uneducated,
pliable folk whose votes can be bought) is probably against their best
interests.

If I vote by phone from home, how do you know there isn't someone
pointing a gun at my head telling me how to vote? That is the *basic*
point behind public polling stations.

And people's SSNs are, in general, far too easy to find (though I suspect

Fine. Now how do I ensure one of those programmers writes the system

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Because there would be but a single system
or type of software used. Either it would have been written correctly
and certified for use in elections or it would not be allowed. Since you
are so worried about fraud, how do you know the election judge is not
tampering with the ballot box while you are not watching? Did you know in
the USA the election judges don't even count the write in votes?  They
just ignore them. They only count the votes for the Republicrats or the
Demopublicans plus now and then a third party if one becomes strong enough
that they cannot be ignored. Regards the gun at your head argument, what
makes you think the public polling places are that much different here?
To get in, you have to run the gauntlet of electioneers standing outside
handling out their pamphlets and holding up their signs. They don't have
guns of course, but there is in many polling places an intense amount of
pressure put on the voter to vote 'the right way'.  At some polling places
in Chicago, you see gang members hanging around out in front, often times
chatting with the police officer assigned there.  I would much rather be 
able to vote in the privacy of my home via telephone. 

And actually, much of the software is already in place. Just some modifi-
cations for security reasons would be needed. We could use no-charge
900 numbers (getting back to their orginal, mass-calling intentions) to
vote. After all, if the newspapers and radio stations run popularity
polls and opinion polls now on 900 numbers I'm sure a secure way could be
devised to conduct a legitimate election via that method also. Preservation
of privacy and integrity in elections has *nothing* to do with the technology
used. They are separate issues entirely, and if anything, technology can
be used to enhance privacy and integrity. Manual elections are very much 
subject to fraud and spying on voters.  Manual voter registration records are
considered public in most places, although *how* the person voted is secret.

Even if you wish to stick with the public polling place concept, why are
these not automated?  Why can't voters walk into a small cubicle with a
terminal, properly validate themselves, and have a list of candidates for
various offices appear on the screen? They would move the pointer around,
selecting the ones of their choice. Votes would be instantly tallied and
the the accumulating totals made available for inspection. The main
problem here, as any good Chicago Democratic politician would tell you is
that it would be hard to get dead people from the cemetery to sit upright
at the terminal and keyboard.     PAT]

Subject: India Receives $82 Billion in Telecom Service Bids


==This Indian Techonomist bulletin (C) Copyright 1995 Rishab Aiyer Ghosh

India receives $82 BILLION in bids for telecom services

August 31, 1995: Bids for basic telecom services across India were
opened today. Sixteen companies submitted the 80 bids for 20 regions
(or "circles"); they were worth a total of $82 BILLION in licence fees
alone. The total bids for likely winners - one private provider is to
compete with the government Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in
each circle - were worth $35.6 billion spread over the next decade.

The surprise star of the show was HFCL, a company with political
connections and a joint venture with Israel's Bezeq, led in all nine
circles for which it bid a total of over $27 billion, between two and
five times the value of the nearest bids in the nine circles.

HFCL bid for the most lucrative areas; Reliance, a large group with
diverse interests and nearly 3 million shareholders, bid very low for
all circles, and got most of the weakest circles, classified "C" by
the government. However, in the desert state of Rajasthan, where
competing Shyam (with China's PTT Guangdong) bid $350 million, 80
times higher than Reliance, the latter may yet win as Shyam is
rumoured to be disqualified on technical grounds.

That makes 15 circles out of 20 divided between two companies.  Denro
Ispat, a steel firm in cooperation with America's Hughes, bagged the
wealthy western states of Karnataka and Maharashtra (which includes
Bombay). BPL, a consumer electronics company, won the southern state
of Tamil Nadu in cooperation with US West.  This will end the
controversy over US West's pilot project in semi-rural Tamil Nadu
involving broadband and wireless services, which was negotiated
directly, bypassing the bidding process.

Big losers included AT&T, who bid along with Birla Communications;
Bell Atlantic who bid with Essar; Bell Canada who bid with the Tatas,
another conglomerate; and Japan's NTT which bid with Itochu and
India's RPG group.

The Indian Techonomist spoke to Dr N Ravi, General Manager of
Reliance's Telecommunications Group. He was pessimistic about any
speedy resolution of the bids. Licences have to be awarded after a
weighted evaluation of the other portion of the bids, including a
development plan and rural infrastructure. However, the skewed bidding
and relative lack of competition will cause problems, as it did with
bids for cellular services, opened three weeks ago. There may be
"caps" - limits on the number of licences for a single company, two in
the case of cellular services. There may be backdoor deals. There may
well be a re-arrangement of Indian and foreign partners, perhaps
forming new "friendships" between till-now competing companies.

Caps would be good for AT&T; they would also be good for HFCL.  For if
it did not seriously misjudge the value of the market, HFCL probably
hoped that the government's caps would, in effect, give it a free
post-bid choice.

At this point it seem that although contracts for cellular services
may be awarded soon - though not by the government target of September
15th - those for basic services will be considerably delayed. Apart
from the complications caused by the bidding itself, there's a court
order against awarding contracts, which will probably be appealed. And
there's the Parliament, which doesn't want to pass a stop-gap
amendment allowing the government to set up a regulator until more
permanent legislation is ready - Opposition parties claim they want to
make the regulator a statutory body right away, although in fact they
just enjoy troubling the government.

Besides, the government has the imminent general elections - due in
the middle of next year - on its mind. And the assasination, a few
hours after the bids were opened, of the Chief Minister of the wealthy
state (and - it was expected - profitable telecom market) of Punjab.

Telecom services will be privatised, after a gap. A most interesting
gap - the fun has just begun.

few hours at http://dxm.org/techonomist/news/bids.html See also:

If you want to use your existing modems, you will need a channel bank
with 16 2WFXS (two-wire FX station) cards.

The main problem with variable length phone numbers is NOT technical
as you have pointed out; it is difficult for humans to use.  It is
very confusing to not know how many digits to expect.  Suppose you
have a form that someone has filled out and there are only six digits.
Does this mean that the number is incomplete, or is it actually
correct?

Well there is in that the USERS of the network expect the numbers to
be in the NPA-NXX-XXXX format.  Additionally, why is there are need
for variable length numbers?  With the new NPS system, there are at
least 2.7 BILLION numbers available.

There are one billion possible numbers of SSN.  I believe the numbers
are reused after a file has been closed for a number of years.  For
what it's worth, the first three digits of an SSN determine where the
card was issued (sort of like an area code).

Subject: Re: Boston Area Telephone Exchange Name History


Interesting to note how, with just a few exceptions, all of these
exchanges have survived for 35-plus years now, intact:

> DOWNTOWN - 185 Franklin St. Office **

> CApitol 3       State Capitol Building     Federal Govt. offices only
> CApitol 7       State Capitol Building     CAPitol

223, 227, 523 and 742 are all still around, all served out of Franklin
Street.  637-1234 and 936-1234 still get the time and weather.  And 
NYNEX offices are still the sole users of 743.

> DOWNTOWN - 8 Harrison Ave. Office **

> DEvonshire 8    Devonshire Street          Only Boston Police (DE 8-1212)

> LIberty 2       Patriotic word             LIBerty

421, 426, 482, and 542 are all still around.  So is 338, which is now
in general use.

> DOWNTOWN - BACK BAY **

> CIrcle 7        Name origin unknown     Only pay phones on this exchange

> KEnmore 6       Kenmore Square          KENmore

262, 266, 267, and 536 are all still around.  So is 247, which served
the Boston Police PBX until just about two years ago, when they moved
to 617-343.  247 is now in general use.

> ARLINGTON

> MIssion 3 / 8   Not a local name        Replaced manual office in 1950s

643 and 648 are still around.  So are 483 and 488, now known as the
"West Medford" exchange (but still billed identically to Arlington).

> BELMONT

> IVanhoe 4 / 9   Not a local name        Replaced manual office in 1950s.

484 and 489 are not only still around, but are STILL the only exchanges
in Belmont.

> BRIGHTON / ALLSTON 

> ALgonquin 4     Name origin unknown     ALGonquin
> STadium 2       Harvard Stadium         STAdium

254 and 782 still exist...in fact I have a couple of 254 lines on my
office telephone.

> UNiversity 8    Harvard University      UNIversity

354, 547, 876, 864, and 868 are all still there, accompanied nowadays
by a slew of 49X exchanges, most belonging to Harvard, and several
MIT exchanges as well.

> CHARLESTOWN

> CHarlestown 2   Name of area served     CHArlestown

242's still there, and it spawned 241 a few years later.

> CHELSEA

> TUrner 4 / 9    Not a local name        Replaced CHelsea 3 manual office 1957

Still there as 884 and 889.  There's now an 887 as well, created after
the old 617-887 Boxford became 508-887 in 1988.

> DORCHESTER

> TAlbot 5        Talbot Avenue           TALbot

Here's one that's gone.  229 is now a Burlington exchange, but a fairly
recent one.  Perhaps BAyside 9 became 929?  265, 282, 288, 436, and
825 are still around.

567 and 569 - still there.  There's 561 and 568 now as well, the latter
added after 617-568 Hudson became 508-568 in 1988.

361 and 364 are still there (the mayor's home phone is on 364).  333 is
around as well, but now counted as a Milton exchange with 696/698 -
see below under Mattapan/Milton.

The BL8 and CU6 exchanges both returned much later -- 258 as an MIT
exchange in Cambridge, 286 in Revere.  296/298 still serves Mattapan,
696/698 still serves Milton. 

> NEEDHAM

> HIllcrest 4     Not a local name        Replaced NEedham 3 manual office

444.  Still in use, along with 449, 455, and 433 added later.

244, 332, 527, and 969 all still exist...along with about a dozen
more recent additions.

> QUINCY

> MAyflower 9     Pilgrims' ship          MAYflower
> PResident 3     Quincy is birthplace of Presidents John Adams & J.Q.Adams

MA9 - or 629 - no longer exists.  472, 479, and 773 are all still
there, with several more recent editions.  The 629 exchange was
assigned much later to Somerville.  Besides GR9/479, there are no
other XX9 exchanges in Quincy even now.

> REVERE

> ATlantic 4 /9   Revere located on ocean {Replaced REvere 8 manual office

284 and 289 are still around,  along with 286 (see Milton/Mattapan,
above).

> ROXBURY

> GArrison 7      William Lloyd Garrison  GARrison
>                 (Abolitionist)
> HIghlands 2 /5  Roxbury Highlands       HIGhlands

427, 442, 445 - all still there.  Very little phone growth there - the
only new addition in 35 years was 541 a few years back.

> SOMERVILLE

> MOnument 6      Name origin unknown     Replaced manual office in 1950's
> PRospect 6      Name origin unknown     Replaced manual office in 1950's

666 and 776 remain in existence, along with several newer exchanges.

268 and 269 are still around, along with newer 463 and 464 exchanges.

> WALTHAM

> TWinbrook 3 /9  Not a local name        Replaced manual office in 1950's

Waltham has seen explosive phone growth, fueled by DID-heavy users in
office parks along Route 128.  893 and 899 are still around, with 890,
891, and 894 arriving a few years later, and literally dozens of new
exchanges in the last decade.  Many of the new "Waltham" exchanges are
used by Cellular One, which used to have its local headquarters in 
Waltham.  

> WATERTOWN

> WAlker 4 / 6    Not a local name        {Replaced WAtertown 3 manual office

Hmm ... I'd always just assumed it was WAtertown!  924 and 926 are still
there, plus 923 and 972, the last for town government only.

> WEST ROXBURY

> FAirview 3/5/7  Not a local name        Replaced manual office approx 1954
> HOmestead 9     Not a local name        {Used for Brookline customers served
>                                        (by W. Roxbury central office

323, 325, 327 -- and that's still it.  469 is still in existence too,
but now counted as a "Brookline" exchange.  I believe there's still
a geographic area along the Brookline/W.Roxbury/Newton line where ALL
customers are assigned 469 and only 469.

> WINTHROP
> VIking 6        Not a local name        Replaced manual office in 1950s

846 - still around and only recently joined by 539.

Great list! -- and fun to see how far back many of today's exchanges
go.

Well, to answer Eric's question, yes, indeed, we offer exactly the
service you seem to need, and in many cases (as is the case for
existing MobilComm Nationwide customers) at a flat monthly rate. Give
us a call, check out our (messy :) ) WWW site, or send us some e-mail
for details. I'll gladly respond to personal e-mail with specific
questions about the service. See address/contact info, below.

As to not being too active on the Digest lately: This is certainly a
regret of mine - regular readers may recall (somewhat long :) ) posts
from me regarding cellular service around the country which I think I
enjoyed posting more than most people enjoyed reading (and reading,
and reading...:) ). And the volume hasn't dwindled because of a lack
of subject matter nor a lessening of my interest - if anything, there
are so many developments going on right now that I'd need to post a
good deal more than I used to in order to keep up.

For example, Cell One/NY (now "AT&T Wireless"...errr..yeah) has had a
recent switch upgrade which prevents calls to 500 numbers from being
placed with 0-500 anymore. AT&T has also stopped supervising 500
*platform* calls (ie, where you don't talk to anyone and just connect
to the platform) which means I don't pay for the 500 call until I talk
to someone. This makes people much more likely to call my 500 from a
cellphone, since they don't pay if I don't answer my 500#.

AT&T has promised to allow 1-500 dialing from carphones (did they
REALLY think this through? Or will they only allow 1-500 from a class
of "non-International" 500? Or can they do special non-fixed-rate
billing through cellcos?...Doubt it..). However, this misses the
point: Allow NON-superivising 0+ access for ALL calls, 500, 700, and
calling card. No one wants to pay to reach a busy or non-answering
number (except on LA's A and B systems, where they don't have a choice
:( ), and AT&T puts its 500, 700, and Calling Card services at a
disadvantage by continuing to supervise them at the AT&T "chime",
instead of when the destination party is reached. Sprint, MCI, et. al.
already do this, as do most of the "800" access calling cards, so why
pay more to use AT&T, when you may not even connect to your party?

Anyhow, as to what Interpage (TM) is doing, well, briefly, since we
started a little over a year ago, we've gone "International" by
sending e-mail, news, and other information to SMS and GSM phones in
Europe (Vodaphone, Orange, SONOFON), as well as traditional alpha and
numeric paging to BT, London Paging, Hutch (UK and Hong Kong), Cantel,
and just about anyone else who asks. :) Although we have pretty low
rates (25 cents per page to the UK), we would like to lower this even
further. I realize we can never get "flat rate" (unlimited) paging
like we do for some US carriers, but if there is any long distance
carrier/reseller out there who can offer us less than 30-second
minimums and/or "lower than the rest of the Wiltel reseller's" rates,
I'd be happy to hear from you. (Please fax an International rate quote
to our fax #, below. No voice calls please... E-Mail is OK, but
include prices - we know more or less what is out there - if you think
you are better, please have something to show for it. I'm not trying
to be difficult, but we don't need a lot of resellers calling us with
rates that are commonplace...) I'd also be glad to hear from carriers
with less than 12 cent daytime rates for direct dial (no T-1, yet!).

We have also started to provide our news and information services to a
number of paging carriers, so if you see the news/sports/weather-cast
on your pager saying "Interpage" or "InfoNews", well, that's us! :)
Some carriers and other firms use us to disseminate their own news via
a news "editor" on our system which they use to input their own
information to their customers/employees on a regular or "as needed"
basis.

If you *do* receive "Interpage" or "InfoNews" stories, please let us
know what you think, and of course, tell us how we can improve and/or
augment these services. Are there any additional services would you
like to see?  For example, is there any interest in aviation weather
forecasts on a pager?  Horoscopes? We tried a few of these, but found
little interest...  We are also the only paging service provider (I
think) to put weather and stock information on any *numeric only*
pager, so you do not need to get a more expensive alpha pager in order
to receive this information. We have not, however, figured out how to
get news stories on a numeric yet...:)

In June, we started to offer our Enhanced Pager Overlay Services
(EPOS).  Working with Arch and SDC, we can provide e-mail, weather,
re-programmable 800 access, voicemail, "Meet Me", faxmail, and most
recently, fax broadcast to literally hundreds of recipients via a
single 800 number which you can access from anywhere in the US and
most areas of Canada.  This package builds upon our initial notion of
allowing ANY alpha or numeric pager to receive e-mail and other
services, but goes beyond this by providing one single number for
people to contact you at for e-mail, voice, voicemail, fax and fax
broadcast services. (Our Web site has a detailed explanation of this
if you want more details on how EPOS works, etc.)

We have also made some substantial additions to our fax services.
Besides our InFax (SM) (automatic INcoming e-mail -> fax [and pager])
and OutFax (SM) (you send text e-mail or postcript level 1 or 2 to one
or more faxes), we have recently started to offer our FaxUp (SM)
service, which allows people to send a fax to us, and we will
automatically convert it into a graphics file and send it along as
e-mail to you. FaxUp can also be used to re-distribute and broadcast
faxes: You send us a fax, and we re-transmit it to a list of fax
and/or e-mail addresses which you may upload to the system, or
configue/modify via telnet access to your personal account.

InterTalk (SM), our e-mail voice response server has also been
improved since my last post to the Digest - well, we didn't *have*
InterTalk at the time of my last posting so I guess anything is an
"improvement". InterTalk allows you to retrieve and hear e-mail
subject headers from any touch tone phone. Thus, to check to see if
you received any new e-mail messages, you would call into InterTalk,
enter your account and password, and then have the option to go
through the headers of all your most recent mail. We also recently
added the ability to call into InterTalk and add or delete weather
forecasts as you travel. If you travel from city to city a good deal,
you can add a weather forecast for the city you happen to be in (or
any city for that matter) and tell our system at what time you want to
be paged. Subsequently, you will be paged with that city's forecast at
your requested time. It makes a good "wake up" service which also
gives you the day's weather, assuming you don't normally receive pages
in the middle of the night! :)

And finally, we consolidated a number of our services for WWW
customers under the "WebReach" (SM) banner. Interpage's WebReach
services allow WWW page owners on any system (not just ours) to be
faxed when a customer browsing their web page sends and order or
requests more information.  This allows individuals and firms to have
a WWW/Internet presence, without having to log on continuously to
ensure timely response to potential customers.

We can also store documents and informational sheets on our system
which will be faxed to customers "on demand". If you have a pager, we
can also create a "callback" service, eg., a customer clicks on a hot
button on your page which will alert you on your pager that you have a
potential customer who would like an immediate callback at the number
provided.

Additionally, direct mapping of WWW pages without the need for
complicated URL's is something new which we recently implemented.
Thus, if you have registered the domain "hello.com" and have your Web
page on our system, you can give out your URL as "www.hello.com",
instead of the actual URL which would look like
"www.interpage.net/misc/others/hello.html".

Anyhow, now that I've bored everyone with all of our newest and
greatest services and features, I'll suggest that you may want to
check out our WWW server (http://www.interpage.net) for more
information. We'd also be happy to fax some literature and brochures
to anyone who asks.

So now do you see what I mean by LONG posts? :)

Before I close, I would however like to thank all the people who have
helped us along in the past, especially those Digest participants who
encouraged us during our beta-test stage last year and enabled us to
grow quite rapidly. Your comments, constructive criticsms, and of
course your patronage have all been greatly appreciated!

My next post will be much more telecom-related, and soon... I promise! :)

Quick question:

I'm a reporter with the {Anchorage Daily News} in Alaska. Our city
government is proposing to sell our phone company, Anchorage Telephone
Utility, which I gather is the largest municipally owned phone company
in the country. I'm trying to find examples of other cities selling
similarly sized phone companies. (ATU is about 145,000 access lines.)
I want to see what happened in other places, vis. rates, layoffs, etc.
Where can I find other examples? Any help gratefully received.

Subject: Split of Area Code 305


The North American Numbering Plan Administration has announced the
impending split of the 305 NPA (South Florida). The following
information is quoted from Bellcore letter IL-95/08-011, dated 23
August 1995:

We have been advised by BellSouth Telecommunications that substantial
telephone number growth in southeastern Florida necessitates splitting
the existing 305 NPA and the simultaneous introduction of a new 954
NPA.

Dade and Monroe Counties, which include the Miami metropolitan area, 
will retain the 305 NPA. The Broward County portion of the current 305 
NPA, including Fort Lauderdale, will change to the new 954 area code.

The split of the 305 NPA, and the beginning of a permissive dialing 
period, is scheduled for 12:01 AM EDT on September 11, 1995. During the 
permissive dialing period, either 305 or 954 will be acceptable in a 
dialed number terminating in the new 954 NPA. The end of permission 
dialing and the beginning of mandatory dialing is scheduled for 
different services as follows: 12:01 AM EDT on April 13, 1996 for 
PAGERS; 12:01 AM EDT on June 1, 1996 for WIRELINE (POTS); and 12:01 AM 
EST on January 1, 1997 for CELLULAR. After each permissive period 
expires, calls dialed with incorrect NPA codes, as defined in the NPA 
split information published in the Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG), 
will be routed to intercept. The 954 NPA prefix codes (NXXs) appear in 
the current version of the LERG.

Central offices in the area to be served by the 954 NPA will be 
modified on a progressive basis to transmit "954" in the calling number 
Automatic Number Identification (ANI). BellSouth will convert all 
pertinent records to 954 the weekend of September 8, 1995. This 
includes customer service records and associated NPA information in 
other systems. After September 11, 1995, all inquiries must refer to 
the correct NPA code.

The attached map [not included in this message] illustrates the 305 and 
the 954 NPA configuration after the split. A listing of the communities 
and exchange prefixes to be included in each area code after the split 
is also attached.

Test calls to verify routing to the new 954 interchangable NPA code may 
be made by dialing 954-236-4242, effective immediately. A recorded 
announcement will indicate that the test call has been successfully completed.

The following dialing procedures will exist for the 305 and 954 NPAs:

* All intra-NPA "local" calls will be dialed on a 7 digit basis with no 
prefix; i.e., NXX+XXXX (7 digits).

* All intra-NPA direct dialed "toll" calls (generally calls that incur 
an additional charge) will be dialed with a prefix "1" and 10 digits; 
i.e., 1+NPA+NXX+XXXX (1 + 10 digits).

* All inter-NPA direct dialed local calls will be dialed with 10 digits 
and no prefix; i.e., NPA+NXX+XXXX (10 digits).

* All inter-NPA direct dialed toll calls will be dialed with a prefix 
"1" and 10 digits; i.e., 1+NPA+NXX+XXXX (1 + 10 digits).

* All operator-assisted calls (both intra- and inter-NPA) including 
credit card, collect, and third-party calls will be dialed with either 
a "0" or a "10XXX+0" prefix and 10 digits; i.e., 0+NPA+NXX+XXXX; or, 
10XXX+0+NPA+NXX+XXXX.

Air Communications Introduces Next Generation Cellular Data Fax Phone.

Revolutionary, industry-first product delivers all-in-one
connectivity, convenience in a pocket-sized device, the new
AirCommunicator.

 SUNNYVALE, Calif., September 5, 1995 -- Air Communications Inc., a
pioneer of cellular data technology and communications devices, today
introduced the new AirCommunicatorx, an innovative hand-held cellular
data fax phone that forges a new category of wireless devices.  This
small, value-driven product offers convenience in an all in one
solution that acts as an extension of the user's desktop.  It delivers
unmatched, integrated wireless connectivity and functionality,
bringing the flexibility of fax, voice mail and voice communications
to users without the need for a computer.  It also uses a serial port
connection to any PC, Macintosh, notebook or PDA to complete e-mail
and remote access operations.

AirCommunicator answers the needs of a broad range of users who
require remote access to information.  While there are an estimated
one million mobile data subscribers in the United States today, that
number is expected to grow to 9.9 million subscribers by the year 2000.
Today's mobile professionals are juggling an unwieldy assortment of
devices aimed at keeping them in touch with their businesses and
families.  The new AirCommunicator is targeted at this market segment,
which makes up approximately 47 percent of the growing market for
mobile data users.  In addition, many of today's 28 million cellular
voice subscribers will be looking to upgrade to add data communications 
capabilities over the next five years.  

"The new AirCommunicator ushers in a new level of convenience for
people on the move," said Dan Seale, president and CEO of Air
Communications.  "We've pioneered a product that works as a
fully-featured data communications tool -- in essence, replicating the
user's desktop environment.  It is the first wireless product to
reliably send, receive and store faxes, all without attaching to a
computing device, so it is ideal for the large number of mobile
professionals who don't carry a portable computer."

Features:

The new AirCommunicator will be offered in two different versions, the
Lite and the Executive.  The two models offer users different levels
of message and fax storage capacity.  Talk, data transmission and
standby time also vary, and the two versions feature different types
of rechargeable batteries -- Ni-Cad, Nickel Metal Hydride and Lithium
Ion -- each providing a technical match to the varying usage patterns
of Air's target markets.  In addition, the Executive comes with the
AirDock, a state-of-the-art charging station, complete with speaker
and microphone for hands-free operation of the AirCommunicator.  For
example, the user can simply hook up the unit to the vehicle's
cigarette lighter to conserve battery power and recharge while
driving, or utilize the RJ-11 jack for landline capability in a hotel
room.

A key differentiator for the product is its ability to both send and
receive faxes without the need for a computer.  Current products on
the market don't offer the same functionality or flexibility.  Users
can store frequently used faxes, such as directions or inventory
forms, on their AirCommunicator and send them directly from the device
without plugging in to a computer.  Another advantage is that users
can receive and store faxes while on the road, and later view or print
them either by sending the fax to a nearby fax machine or using
standard fax software on a computer.

"The ability to receive faxes is what sets this product apart from
competitive solutions," said Andy Seybold, publisher of Andy Seybold's
Outlook on Mobile Communications and Computing.  "The most frequently
used type of data transmission is facsimile, with e-mail, file
transfer and dial-up connections making up the remainder.  The need to
access these forms of data don't change just because a person is on
the road.  With AirCommunicator, users have that access and can count
on it to work reliably."

Features include:

Feature AirCommunicator Lite - AirCommunicator Executive;
Digital Answering Machine 2.7 minutes message storage - 16 minutes message
storage;
Fax Storage 6 pages - 37 pages;
Talk Time 90 minutes -  100 minutes;
Data Transmission Time 50 minutes - 60 minutes;
Standby Time 8 hours - 9 hours;
Battery Type (rechargeable) Nickel-Cadmium  - (NiCad) Lithium Ion;
Phone Weight 11.9 ounces - 9.9 ounces;
AirDock Not included - Included
Data and Fax Performance 14.4K Baud - 14.4K Baud

Software

The new AirCommunicator includes bundled software that enables users to
better monitor and manage their communications: 

x AirController reports continuous on-line status such as connection
rate, throughput and cellular event status.  It also allows users to
set advanced preferences such as minimum signal conditions and maximum
error levels, achieving the most efficient use of cellular airtime.  A
user-friendly interface on the device or on the computer screen helps
users manage their mobile data communications.

x Auto Phone Updater provides users with easy remote wireless access
to software upgrades, including the latest in modem firmware, to add
new features and functionality to the AirCommunicator.  The device
never becomes obsolete.  Users simply call in to a specified number to
download the upgrade wirelessly -- there's no need for a computer or
to visit a service center.

Underlying Technology

AirCommunicator's unmatched performance and reliability is derived
from its state-of-the-art underlying technology, AirTrue.  AirTrue
leverages the existing AMPS cellular network to provide ubiquitous
access, high throughput rates for data (14.4K and higher), and ease of
use.  In addition, because AirTrue integrates radio frequency (RF) and
modem technologies, it achieves significantly higher first time
connect rates of 94 percent -- far exceeding those of its nearest
competitors.  It also allows users to connect to any modem at any time
without the need for special host-end technology, dramatically
reducing or eliminating implementation costs.
 
Pricing and Availability

The AirCommunicator Lite and Executive models will be available in
September 1995 with street pricing expected to start at $695.

About Air Communications

Air Communications Inc., headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., was
founded in 1992 to be the global leader in providing innovative mobile
connectivity solutions that meet the needs of today's users.  To
achieve its vision, the company has pioneered its AirTrue cellular
data technology, and has integrated the technology into its family of
AirCommunicator products.  Air Communications' products are sold

        Has the Las Vegas exchange been sold?  It used to be owned by
a firm called, I believe, Centel, and was one of the largest non-Bell
exchanges in the country.

        So the "real ones" in Las Vegas *are* non-Bell.

         In Southwestern Bell territory, many telephones in such areas
have been changed to rotary dial.  Curiously, if you want to make a
credit card call, you can dial the calling card number using the
rotary dial, at least for intraLATA calls.

         The only case I've found where you can dial your calling card
number with a rotary dial.

I sure don't know where they come up with the idea that shunting the pad 
after connect will help fight crime. For less then $20.00 you can get a 
portable Touch Tone generator about the size of a small calculator and 
for a little more one with lots of memory. I'm sure the drug dealers have 
the best. I was forced to get one because of the COT's.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Uh, no backtalk from you please! Let's
not have any consistency here; it adds too many problems. If you were
in Chicago, you could always go downtown to the Board of Trade Building
and use their payphones; regardless of how much cocaine gets passed 
around in the men's restrooms there each day, no changes will ever be
made in the way their payphones operate. Or you could go over and use
the phones at the Cook County Criminal Courts Building, 26th and Cali-
fornia Avenue. They stand in the hallways there -- right outside of
'Drug Court' mind you! -- and peddle their wares, and the payphones
there -- although not in the jail next door -- are still working fine.
I guess it all depends on who you know; hasn't it always been that way?  PAT]

You had it pretty good for some time and now you're just coming into
line with the rest of us.  In NYNEX/NY land and BellSouth/NC, calling
into the CO-based e-mail service is a local call, and charged as such.
If you're at a payphone, then it's whatever the cost of the call would
be regardless of whether you were calling a pager, voice mail, or your
mother.  For these kinds of calls, I use a TotalTel card, which has
some very competitive rates.

What annoys me more, though, is that the City of Charlotte has genuine-Bell-
looking COCOTs imbedded into the city bus shelters along Tryon Street
(the main drag through town).  They have red inserts boasting .25/minute to 
call anywhere in the USA.  However, they also charge .25 for an 800 call.  
When I dialed 211 to ask if this was a mistake, the representative
(who had probably heard this question more than once before) told me
that the North Carolina commission that controls such things approved
this charge in December 1993.  I scurried into an office building that
had a BellSouth payphone to make my call.  Geez, what a hassle!

Pat, 

It occured to me that pay phones could be getting removed from poor
neighborhoods in order to stimulate the new instalation of LIFELINE
service!

Wasn't there some dialogue about the low penetration of Service to poor,
minority, and immigrant neighborhoods late last year? I believe that
regulators decreed something *encouraging* LECs to promote Lifeline 
service in such areas. 


Regards,   *BOB*


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Could be, but Lifeline service is not a
big profit center. IBT had to be 'encouraged' by the Illinois Commerce
Commission before they would do much with it. Seems like a hard way to
earn a profit if you ask me.  You could be right though.   PAT]

258 is not exclusively MIT; Draper has numbers in the bottom half, and
there may be others (One Kendall Square?).  253 and 258 are served out
of the Bent St. CO in East Cambridge, which occasionally causes
problems due to a bad trunk between Bent St. and Ware St.

I occasionally get calls from people who should have dialed 8-xxxx
rather than 3-xxxx.  (Not to mention all the people who want to dial
369-94zz and forget to dial 9 first.)

And, of course, the origin of the name PROspect should be fairly

Neither is the reality.  In practice, the way variable-length numbers
works is based upon the trunk signalling (two l's, British spelling)
method used in Europe, which is different from the trunk signaling
(one l, American spelling) in the USA.  The European networks
(pre-SS7) used compelled signaling (such as MF/R2), in which each
digit is sent on an open trunk down to the next, and ack'd at the far
end.  When the far end has enough digits, it sends the appropriate
signal and the call goes ahead.  This had some obvous round-trip-delay
issues, but was plenty fast for the old steppers that dominated
Europe.  (This is a stepper-friendly scheme.)

The USA, on the other hand, implemented toll dialing in crossbars,
which have digit registers that store dialed digits.  Thus the trunk
isn't selected until a three-digit (or six-digit with NPA) prefix is
dialed, and the dialed number is sent en-bloc once all seven or ten
digits (plus the 1 in some cases, but that wasn't actually part of the
number) are collected.  In the American system, the originating switch
needs to know how many digits will be there.  IDDD time-outs, of
course, are a hack that were added because of this incompatibility.

With SS7 (or ISDN), digits can still be sent en-bloc or "compelled",
as required.

        This varies all over the place.  Some IXCs typically *do*
issue a calling card number that corresponds to your telephone number.
I have had such cards from AT&T, MCI and Sprint, as well as my LEC,
but also some which are non-conforming from the same IXCs.

        Calling cards are consistently used to make calls over carriers
other than the one the calling phone is presubscribed to -- by dialing
10XXX+0+, or by dialing an 800 number.

        Sprint a year or two ago, and may still, have an arrangement
to call using your Discover card.  This is a different 800 number for
this purpose, and you dial your Discover card number (16 digits) as
your calling card number.

        Most carriers do accept calls on LEC cards or in that format,
particularly carriers such as Oncor and other ones which charge
excessive rates, since they have no other way to bill your call except
through your LEC account.  (Surely no one has an Oncor calling
card[!].)

In the good old days when calling grandma I'd dial 0175 (area code),
wait for second dialtone and then dial her local number.  Dialing 0175
actually connected me to her area code main exchange from where I then
dialed her local number.  This way my local or area code exchange
needn't know anything about the numbering in 0175.

Today there are some 300 AXE10 local and transport switches in Sweden.
But there are only a few *gateway* switches.  They'd be the only ones
that need to deal with foreing numbering.

As variable length is/was just about the norm in Europe I can attest
that it was not confusing.  In the Netherlands the norm was that the
first digit of the subscriber number told the number of digits.  When
expansion was needed some numbers got an additional first digit, again
based on the original first number.  So the (actual) number in
Amsterdam 59121 was changed to 359121 and later to 6395121.  The
intercept is easy to understand: "The number has been changed, dial
now first the digit 3 followed by the old number".  What is the
intercept after the grace period when you dial a number by its old
area code in the US?

The argument about forms is bogus.  There are many cases where the
number of figures is not fixed in something you can fill out in a
form.  When in the UK something fills in his car registration number
as "V 5", would somebody wonder whether it was incomplete or actually
correct?  (Yes, that number does exist; I have seen it.)  When
somebody fills in his Dutch giro-account as 4832 does this mean the
number is incomplete, or actually correct?  (Again, that number does
exist together with 5, 6 and 7 digit numbers.  Probably also numbers
with less digits.)

Variable length phone numbers appear to be confusing to those not used
to it; that does not mean it is generally confusing!

From: naddy@mips.pfalz.de (Christian Weisgerber)
Subject: Variable Length Phone Numbers
Date: Thu, 7 Sep 1995 00:16:38 MET


Recently, comp.dcom.telecom has seen some talk on the viability of
variable length phone numbers within a country (or any specific
network, for that matter). Many posters, especially those from North
America, insist on their belief that phone numbers have to be of
constant length, otherwise one must have timeouts etc.

First, let me state that I see *no reason whatsoever* why there can't be
variable length phone numbers or why a switch would have to know the
total length of the number. If you think there is a need for such
restrictions, please explain why you think so. Your reasons are not
obvious.

I would also like to point out that in Germany, where I live, telephone
numbers vary in length, in fact my voice number is +49.621.5870460 and
my modem number is +49.621.583214, area codes vary in length (2..5
digits), we have DID numbers of different lengths, and all of this
without any kludges like second dial tones, timeouts, etc. Claiming that
this is impossible is ridiculous in face of the facts.

What is a phone number? For the most part, a phone number is a *route*
through the network. The last few digits are a unique ID that maps onto
a particular line in the destination switch. (Whether the destination
switch is a telco CO or a PBX does not matter.)

What must a switch do during call set-up? It receives dialing
information (single or multiple digits) from an inbound trunk (or from
the line card, if it is the caller's switch), and, after collecting
enough of these, selects an outbound trunk. Further dialing info it
receives is passed on to the switch on the outbound trunk. Note that
no trunk line has to be actually connected yet. The destination switch
collects dialing info until a line that it serves is identified, then
it initiates a ring signal. Information about this is passed back the
chain of switches to the caller's switch which locally feeds a "remote
is ringing" signal. When the called line answers, again information is
passed back to the caller's switch, and now the speech circuit is
actually activated along the switch chain.

Of course the above is somewhat simplified, but it is the principle a
call set-up works by. In the ISDN age, the switches communicate using
SS7 or, in the case of ISDN BR and PRIs, both of which can be used to
connect PBXes by the way, the D channel protocol preferred in your part
of the world.

This system works with SS7/ISDN. It also worked with the prior German
phone technology, purely electro-mechanical switches. (That's relays,
levers, etc. No transistorized technology whatsoever.) With that
technology speech circuits were connected through to the next switch
already during dialing, though.

So, you want to give me a call?

Okay, you dial +49 or within Germany 0. Now you're on the long distance
level of the German Telekom network.

You dial          selects
- <6>             South western Germany.
- 6<2>            The Ludwigshafen/Mannheim area.
- 62<1>           The cities of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim themselves.
- 621 <5>         Ludwigshafen.
- 621 5<8>        The particular part of Ludwigshafen I live in.
- 621 58<70460>   That's my line. My phone is ringing!
                  (Actually, the final 0 helps selecting a particular
                  device on my ISDN line.)

When I answer the phone, the call circuit will be established and voila!

Easy, isn't it?

Subject: Excel Telecommunications Cited For Slamming
Date: 8 Sep 1995 13:38:36 GMT
Organization: Wheat


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- EXCEL TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC. Is apparently
liable for a forfeiture of $80,000 in slamming cases (switching a
person's primary long distance carrier without their prior
authorization). Common Carrier Action by the F.C.C. August 18 by NAL
(Notice of Apparent Liability) (DA 95-1833).

   According to Anna M. Gomez, a spokesperson for the F.C.C.,
"apparently solid facts", have been brought to the F.C.C.'s attention
concerning two specific slamming incidents. The complainants Mr. Bruce
Adelman of Los Angeles, CA and Mrs.  Robert J. Blake of Altadena, CA
both had their long distance services wrongfully switched to Excel
through the use of both forged signatures AND forged social security
numbers.

  To see if there was a trend here, Discount Long Distance Digest also
checked with the California State Public Utilities Commission to
investigate whether Excel has slamming complaints pending against them
on a state level.

  According to Marko Valente, Manager of Consumer Affairs at the CPUC,
Excel has had approximately 10 informal slamming complaints (24 total)
made against them by California residents during 1995. None have
resulted in more serious 'formal' complaints. The figures seem to be
at, or even below, the average level for a long distance provider.

  Chris Dance, VP of Legal Affairs at Excel stated, "It is the first
penalty ever implied upon Excel by the F.C.C. The 'slams' in question
were committed by certain independent contractors of Excel, and Excel
intends to pursue and prosecute the independent sales representatives
involved in order to recover these amounts".

  Dance also stated that Excel will file a petition for reconsideration 
with the F.C.C. within the week. Excel currently has approximately
300,000 independent sales representatives.

One use for the symbol is pounds weight, as in non-metric measure.  In my
experience (in Canada, with heavy exposure to US writing) this is much
rarer than its use as a number sign.

No; either that's a coincidence or else someone thought it was a good idea
to make the substitution in the position of a symbol sometimes called by a
similar name.  The use for pounds weight is much older than ASCII.

Yes, and all of it anecdotal.  I say let it die, unless this time we can

Neither does the name for the key.

"#" is the "pound sign" commonly used in Civil and Mechanical Engineering
to represent pounds of weight or force.

Subject: FCC Warning on International Dial-a-Porn


Here is the text of a recent FCC Consumer Alert regarding international
dial-a-porn:

 FCC CONSUMER ALERT 

 Office of Public Affairs
 Public Service Division

 1919 M Street NW
 Washington, D.C., 20554
 202-418-0200/TT 202-418-2555

 International Dial-a-Porn 
 August 1995

Q. What is meant by "International Dial-a-Porn?"

A. The term "International Dial-a-Porn" refers to indecent or obscene, 
recorded or live, conversations that are offered over the telephone on a 
commercial basis by information providers located in foreign countries. 
International Dial-a-Porn is one of a growing number of "information 
services." Other types of international information services include 
horoscopes, "psychic hotlines," work-at-home schemes and chat groups. The 
charges for such services appear on the customers' monthly local telephone 
bill as international long distance calls. 

There has been an increase in the number of such international calls,
stemming in part to Congressional regulations tightening up on abuses
in these services in the United States. Due to consumer complaints
about fraudulent billing and the unauthorized use of their telephones
to place such calls, Congress, in 1992, restricted the ability of
information-service providers to use domestic pay-per-call ("900" or
"976") telephone numbers in the provision of their services. As a
result, many providers of such services moved their operations to
points outside the United States.

Q. Why is International Dial-a-Porn a problem? 

A. Because the blocks applied to prevent the use of domestic 900 and
976 calls for information services do not block international long
distance calls, minors and other unauthorized users can use a
subscriber's telephone line for access to an International Dial-a-Porn
or other information service without the subscriber's knowledge or
permission.  Furthermore, because the charges for international
information services are simply added to a telephone subscriber's
bill, without a prior credit arrangement, and because they are based
on substantial per-minute charges that are generally not disclosed in
advance, a telephone subscriber can receive a bill for calls to
information services that is unexpectedly large.

Q. Are 800 telephone numbers used for access to international Dial-a-Porn 
services? 

A. Because calls to 800 numbers are widely understood by telephone users 
to be toll free, it is a violation of federal law for providers of 
Dial-a-Porn or other information services to offer service over an 800 
number and then to charge a caller for service (unless the provider has 
entered into a prior arrangement with the caller to bill him or her 
separately for the service or to charge the service to the caller's credit 
card). 

An information provider is allowed to use 800 numbers to advertise its
services. It is also allowed to advertise an 800 number and, when a
caller dials the 800 number, direct the caller to hang up and place an
international call that will be billed at international per-minute
rates.

Telephone subscribers should, when calling information services,
beware of an unlawful practice engaged in by some information-service
providers.  That is, when a caller dials an advertised 800 number, the
information-service provider will direct the customer, without hanging
up, to dial additional numbers, often described as an "access code."
Dialing such numbers often converts the call into an international,
direct-dial long distance call that will be billed at relatively high
international rates.

Q. How do I recognize an international telephone number? 

A. It's not always easy to tell. Most international telephone numbers
are preceded by the numbers 011. Telephone numbers in Canada and the
Caribbean region, however, have area codes that make them look like
U.S. telephone numbers. For example, calls to British Columbia, Canada
start with the area code 604 and calls to the Caribbean begin with
area code 809.

Moreover, advertisements for Dial-a-Porn and other information services 
sometimes direct customers to dial a string of numbers that contains the 
011 international call designator, disguised so as to hide the fact that 
the call is in fact an international call. For example, the number in the 
advertisement might be 1-0xxx-011-xx-xx- xxx-xxxx (where x is any digit). 
In this example, the first five digits,1-0xxx, are the access code of a 
U.S. international carrier and the 011 is the prefix to an international 
telephone number. Similarly, as more fully explained in the previous 
question, the use of an 800 telephone number to arrange access to an 
international

Dial-a-Porn service could mislead customers into thinking that they are 
dialing a domestic telephone number. If you are unfamiliar with an area 
code advertised, we suggest that you look it up in your telephone book or 
ask a telephone operator whether the telephone number is an international 
one. 

Q. What should I do if I disagree with a telephone bill listing charges to 
international Dial-a-Porn numbers?

A. You should first try to resolve your complaint with the local
telephone company on whose bill the charge appears. In some cases,
however, your local telephone company may refer you directly to the
long distance company or to the company that provided the Dial-a-Porn
or other information service. This is because the local company merely
acts as a billing agent for the long distance company or the
information-service provider and does not resolve their billing
disputes.

All of the major U.S. local telephone companies have agreed to work
with subscribers, long distance companies and information-service
providers during the first billing cycle (that is, the first billing
period for which information-service charges appear on the local bill)
to resolve subscriber complaints that they did not make the calls or
that the calls were not authorized. They will seek to ensure that the
Dial-a-Porn provider, rather than the subscriber, bears the cost of
the disputed calls. Be aware, however, that not every local telephone
company has agreed to this policy. If your local telephone company
does not agree to participate, your refusal to pay disputed charges
could result in its terminating your telephone service.

If you are unable to persuade one of these companies to adjust the
charges, and you feel that such refusal was unreasonable, you can file
a written complaint with the FCC. Although the FCC cannot adjust your
telephone bill, the FCC will investigate your complaint and determine
whether any of the companies have violated the Communications Act or
FCC regulations and whether to initiate an enforcement action.

To file a complaint, simply send a letter describing your complaint, in 
your own words, to: 

        Federal Communications Commission
        Common Carrier Bureau
        Informal Complaints and Inquiries Branch
        Enforcement Division
        Stop Code 1600A2
        Washington, D.C. 20554

Your complaint letter should include your name and address, the
telephone number or numbers involved with your complaint, the
telephone number where you can be reached during the business day, the
names of all companies involved with your complaint, and a copy of the
bill(s) listing the charges that you are disputing. It will expedite
processing of your complaint if you circle on the copy of the bill(s)
all call charges that you are disputing.

Q. What should I do if I believe that an advertisement for an
international Dial- a-Porn or other information service was false or
deceptive?

A. The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") is responsible for preventing
the distribution of false or deceptive advertisements in consumer
products. If you feel that a company's advertisement was false or
misleading, you should call your regional FTC office or write to:
Federal Trade Commission Correspondence Branch Washington, D.C. 20580

While the FTC does not resolve individual disputes, your comments help
in its law enforcement efforts. Additionally, you may wish to contact
your state's consumer protection office, the consumer-protection
division of your state's Attorney- General's office, or the office of
your local District Attorney. You also may wish to contact the
National Fraud Information Center at 1-800-876-7060. The National
Fraud Information Center is a private, non-profit national consumer
organization that will report your complaints to the appropriate
federal or state governmental agency.

Q. What can consumers do to protect against unauthorized access by
minors to International Dial-a-Porn services?

A. As a first step, you can, of course, instruct your children to
refrain from making calls to International Dial-a-Porn or other
information services that encourage long, expensive telephone calls.
At present there is no way selectively to block the use of your
telephone from being used to call International Dial-a-Porn or other
international information services. You can, however, request your
presubscribed long distance telephone company to block your telephone
line so that it cannot be used to make calls directly to any
international telephone number. Your presubscribed long distance
company should generally make blocking of international calls
available at no charge, but you should be aware that such a block will
affect only international calls made using that presubscribed long
distance company. It is possible for you or someone using your
telephone to evade a blanket international call block by dialing the
access code for one of the U.S. international long distance telephone
companies and then using that company to dial the international
telephone number.

Q. What steps is the Commission taking to prevent unauthorized minors
and other users from gaining access to international Dial-a-Porn or
other information services?

A. The FCC cannot prevent unauthorized use of a subscriber's telephone. 
It is the responsibility of telephone subscribers to control access to
their own telephones. The FCC, however, has taken actions to deal with
abuses by providers of international Dial-a-Porn.  As a result of the
recent increase in complaints about abuses by international
Dial-a-Porn providers, the FCC is taking several steps to protect
telephone subscribers who have been billed for international
Dial-a-Porn calls they did not authorize. First, the FCC is working
with local, long distance and foreign telephone companies to put in
place procedures to resolve consumer billing disputes promptly and
fairly. The FCC also has adopted rules to ensure that telephone
companies comply with federal law in this area and will vigorously
enforce them. Second, the FCC is writing to foreign countries that
attract the highest number of Dial-a-Porn calls from the United States
to ask for assistance in addressing abuses committed by providers
located within their countries. Third, the FCC is educating consumers
about international Dial-a-Porn and other information services so that
they can take steps to prevent unauthorized use of their telephones by
minors or others to gain access to such services. The FCC has also
asked U.S. local and long distance telephone companies to do the same
for their customers.

Subject: Cell One/NY Discontinues ATT 500 Service When ATT Takes Over!
Date: Tue, 12 Sep 1995 05:29:46 EDT


After recently abandoning the widely recognized "Cellular One" name
and calling themselves "AT&T Wireless Services", Cell One/NY completed
a number of dialing procedure changes which currently do not allow
anyone on the CO/NY (00025) system to place 0-500 calls to AT&T's 500
service.  ("B" Side NYNEX customers have no problem in completing
0-500 calls.)

When AT&T introduced 500 service, most of the McCaw properties
immediately accepted 0-500 calls, and in some cases, since AT&T
*wisely* chose not to supervise (start "billing", sort of) 0-500 calls
until the called party answered, no airtime charges where incurred.
This had a number of benefits:

-Those who called me on my 500 number from their carphones would NOT
have to pay any airtime charges if I did not answer. Most 0+ calls on
AT&T, including the older 0-700 service, DO immediately supervise, and
thus, even if you never get connected to anyone, you pay an airtime
charge. It is precisely because of this that I never use my AT&T card
from my cellphone, and why I dropped my 700 number. (And let's not
hear how "correct" this is or why we should all be billed airtime for
calls to the AT&T "bong" tone; almost every other LD co's calling card
service does NOT supervise until the called party answers. If AT&T
doesn't want to help lower my airtime charges, why should I use their
overpriced calling card service at $1 per shot when there are 17.5
cent per minute, 6-second billing, no surcharge calling cards out
there which do NOT supervise until the call is answered?)

-I could program my 500 number from my carphone for no charge, thus
directing calls to my cellphone when I was in the car, and making it
more likely that someone would call me. CO/NY benefited from this as
my airtime usage went up as I was able to be easily reachable by the
single number - my 500 number - that many people try to reach me on.

As a result of "AT&T Wireless'" dialing changes, it seems that there is 
no way to dial 0-500 calls, and thus AT&T's 500 service is becomming 
increasingly useless. 

I contacted CO/NY, and they have been much less responsive on this
issue than they normally are on others. This may be attributed to
their lack of knowledge regarding the 500 service, but they even told
me that OTHER CO/NY customers have been complaining about no longer
being able to access AT&T's 500 service, and so far, nothing has been
done, and they do not seem to consider it to even be a problem.

It seems in many ways indicative of how AT&T's "right hand" doesn't
know what it's "left hand" is doing. The premier McCaw/AT&T Wireless
market on the eastern seaboard, which USED to readily accept 0-500
calls, for some reason, after the "conversion" to "AT&T Wireless", can
no longer accept calls to AT&T's primary personal number service.

This pathetic illustration of how a service *specifically* dsesigned
for a highly mobile and telecom-literate subscriber base is not only
unsupported, but also unavailable, is telling of the (seemingly poor)
state of affairs at AT&T these days, and an issue which they should
rapidly remedy. The mere fact that 0-500 dialing worked BEFORE they
assumed control of CO/NY, and that right after they did 0-500 dialing
stopped simply adds insult to injury.

I hope that CO/NY's unresponsiveness in this situation is constrained
to this instant case, and that in general, the AT&T takeover did not
in any way reduce their spirit of service and responsiveness which has
resulted in some (generally) positive posts by myself and other Digest
readers in the past.

If any other CO/NY subscribers or roamers on CO/NY's system have
experienced similar difficlties, please let me know.

Other than being terse, the UNIX mail command is not very UNIX-like.
It combines a large number of functions into one program and, while it
is possible to shell out between operations, the ability to perform
specific tasks relies upon lengthy command line switch sequences,
rather than being the default.  MH is much more akin to the UNIX
culture, with a variety of logical commands for specific operations
which can be combined, as necessary, into shell script or programming
routines.
 
Thus, it would be understandable to see MH as, primarily, a
programmer's toolkit.  With the explosion in UNIX-based Internet
providers, the MH commands would provide quick tie-ins to BBS
front-end menus, or even such ambitious tasks as a fully tutorial, but
fully functional, email "lesson".
 
The perception of MH as only a development tool would, however, be
unfortunate.  As Peek's book very clearly shows, MH is fully viable
alongside mail, though probably more demanding than elm or PINE.  The
tutorial section manages to give a clear picture of a basic mail
system, in very short order.
 
Peek has done an admirable job with this book.  It manages to be not
only a tutorial, but a solid technical reference as well.  The
material is approachable without ever becoming sappy; accurate without
being pedantic; and, complete without being verbose.  The content is
*very* thoughtful: at one point a command is given which would invoke
an editor, and the editor's exit command is given for those who might
be unfamiliar with it.  The UNIX system is assumed but knowledge is
not, and any rational reader would be able to understand this work in
full.  This third edition adds material on MIME (Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions) and multimedia.
 
This book is recommended for those developing mail "front ends", for
UNIX users wanting another (very functional) mail operation, or for
technical writers wanting an excellent example of documentation.

Subject: Bell Canada Calling Cards in the USA
Organization: Bell Canada
Date: Tue, 12 Sep 1995 15:03:51 GMT


A recent post to this newsgroup stated that Bell Canada Calling Cards
will not be validated by AT&T for calls to Canada from the US.  This
is not true.  From most locations in the United States customers can
reach Canada by dialing 302 plus the number they want to reach.

In recent times, calling long distance from the US has been complicated 
by the many small telephone companies springing up in many states.
Many of these smaller companies do not accept the Bell Canada Calling
Card.

Due to this, Bell has now instituted Canada Direct from the US.  By
dialing 1-800-555-1111 in circumstances such as this customers will be
able to use their Bell Canada Calling Card to place their calls.

There is no service charge for using Canada Direct.  Calls are charged
at Canadian rates on customers' Bell Canada Calling Card.  Canada
Direct can be accessed from most home, office or pay phones and,
because the service is offered toll free to hotels internationally,
expensive hotel surcharges can be avoided.

We just wanted to set the record straight.

From: Carl Moore <cmoore@ARL.MIL>
Subject: A Very Taxing Situation: TAX-1040


8 April 1995 {Washington Post}, page H5 column 3 had this:

IRS has toll-free number 1-800-TAX-1040, and some people in Washington
DC have been misinterpreting the instruction (provided in the income-tax 
return booklet) "Do not dial 1-800 when dialing a local number." 

Specifically, they have been omitting the 1-800; this reaches
202-TAX-1040, which is being used by a tax service NOT AFFILIATED WITH
I.R.S., and its owner was being driven crazy by such misdirected
calls.  The IRS, according to the article, insists its instruction is
clear.  The article does not say this, but 202-TAX-1040 is not being
reached in this manner from Maryland and Virginia suburbs, because
they have to use area code 202 to call DC even though it is local.

I looked in an income-tax return booklet myself.  I remembered
(correctly) that the local numbers given for the IRS are given without
an area code.  For the Chicago area, it gives a seven digit number for
Chicago and "1-312" plus the same number for the suburbs.  What is the
problem with this: Print all local numbers with an area code.  Is
there a problem with people figuring out it is a local call for them?


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The 'local' IRS number here in the Chicago
area is 312-435-1040. The reason I say 'local' in this way is because I
called it once and the person who I spoke with was located in Kansas City,
which is where tax documents for this area are processed. She said that
yes, there were IRS people in Chicago, but 'sometimes we take calls here
also from that area.'  Most of 312-435 -- all of it for quite a few years --
was devoted to the Federal Court in Chicago. Although located on the
upper floors of the federal building here (where most phones are 312-353),
the courts always had their own centrex on 312-435. 

And yes Carl, there is a problem for some people figuring out anything
where phones are concerned.  Just a couple days ago I heard yet another
ignorant raving by someone on a radio talk show claiming that the new area
code for our region (847) effective in January is 'just a plot by telco'
to decrease the local toll-free calling area and increase the number of
'long distance calls' people have to make. I mean, they could have discussed
the affect this will have on switchboards that are programmed incorrectly
and the problems people may have getting through to one of the newer and
unfamiliar area codes, but instead they were on that other tired, worn-out
tangent. 

And now we have been advised that the deep-pockets on LaSalle Street
downtown will not tolerate any new area codes for themselves. I reported
here recently that the inner-city itself was to have the new area code 773
while outlying areas of the city would retain 312. But oh no ... it would
be too much of an imposition to ask the Board of Trade, First National
Bank, the Federal Reserve and the downtown department stores to change
their code, so the other two million nine hundred thousand residents of
Chicago will have to change theirs instead. They will get 773, so that
American Express, et al don't have to risk getting any wrong numbers or
possibly not getting calls intended for them. 

What makes this get really kinky, telephonically speaking, is that while
on the south end of 'downtown' there is a fairly even breaking point from
one central office to the next and you can more or less cross from one side
of the street to the other and be in different area codes if you wish, the
north side offices affected by the 312/773 split are not carved up quite
as nicely. The boundaries go up and down little side streets with 'fingers'
of the downtown exchanges extending northward to Fullerton Avenue (2400 north)
in a couple cases and only to North Avenue (1600 north) in other cases. Here
and there it stops at the river when working westward, while other times
stopping its westward outreach at Halsted Street (800 west). So like it
or not, the folks on the near north side of Chicago will have an overlay
arrangement between 312/773 by default; by virtue of the geography involved.
They are already howling, and the cut is not due for more than a year.  PAT]

Subject: FCC Rules Against Carrier Kickbacks to ESPs
Date: 12 Sep 1995 10:58:04 -0400
Organization: Wilkinson, Barker, Knauer & Quinn (Washington, DC, USA)


The FCC staff issued a letter ruling on September 1 that ruled against
a variety of techniques used by enhanced service providers to provide
"services" such as international dial-a-porn and free BBS/internet
access by means of kickbacks to the ESP and/or restricting access to
the ESP to a single IXC.  Here's the text of the ruling:

Dear Mr. Marlowe:

     This is in response to your informal request for a staff ruling
regarding the legality of certain information and/or entertainment programs
provided pursuant to tariffed rates for international communications
services.   Your inquiry is made on behalf of clients who apparently are
interested in tariffing "international long distance services" for the
transmission of information and/or entertainment programs.  You present
scenarios whereby calls to foreign destinations providing audio information
programs would be transmitted through three different dialing sequences: 

(1) 10XXX + international number; (2) 1-500-NXX-XXXX; or (3) 1-700-NXX-XXXX.  

In each case, the calls would be transmitted by an entity authorized
to provide international direct dialed telecommunications services
pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act (the Act) at a
tariffed rate.  Calls to the international information programs would
be billed to telephone subscribers at that tariffed rate as standard
toll charges.  No charges would be assessed by the information
provider directly to the caller or subscriber.  You ask whether the
legality of the arrangement would be affected if: (1) the carrier
remits a portion of the transport charge to the party advertising the
destination number; or (2) the carrier remits a portion of the
transport charge to the destination entity for providing the
information.  You also inquire whether the arrangement is lawful if
steps are taken so that the destination number could not be accessed
through any other carrier, and whether such calls may be billed on a
separate page with consumer disclosures as non-deniable (so that
disputes do not lead to disconnection of service).

     As explained below, the staff concludes that it is a violation of 
federal law for any entity to provide tariffed common carrier communications 
services in an arrangement -- whether domestic or international --
where charges are assessed for calls to information programs in the
manner you describe and/or when the carrier blocks access to a number
from other carriers.  Common carriers engaged in such practices are
not providing common carrier communications services in a just and
reasonable manner as required by Section 201(b) of the Act, and are
violating both the letter and spirit of Section 228 of the Act.

     Traditionally, information and entertainment programs have been
provided to telephone subscribers at rates exceeding the tariffed
transmission rates charged by the transmitting common carrier.  Such
interstate information services are regulated as "pay-per- call"
services under the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act
(TDDRA) (codified at Section 228 of the Act) and implementing
regulations adopted by both this Commission and the Federal Trade
Commission.  Our rules require that all pay-per-call services must be
provided on the 900 service access code.  Common carriers involved in
either transmitting and/or billing subscribers for pay-per-call
services are subject to several statutory requirements intended to
ensure that consumers are able to prevent access to or charges for
unwanted information services.  Specifically, the TDDRA requires
carriers to offer telephone subscribers the option of blocking access
to pay-per-call services and prohibits the disconnection of basic
telecommunications services for failure to pay pay-per-call charges.
While the statute establishes a comprehensive system for federal
regulation of pay-per-call services, it specifically exempts from
pay-per-call status "any service the charge for which is tariffed" and
services offered pursuant to a "presubscription or comparable
arrangement."

     In determining whether an entity licensed as a common carrier may
lawfully provide service in the manner you describe, we note first
that information programs should not be tariffed as common carrier
services.  Rather, common carriers may offer information programs only
as non-tariffed "enhanced" services in accordance with Section 64.702
of the Commission's rules.  Moreover, it is a basic and central
principle of common carriage that a carrier may provide tariffed
service only as an objective conduit of a customer's communication,
without influence or control in determining either the content of the
communication or the destination of a customer's calls within its
authorized service area.  See Amendment of Parts 2, 91, and 99 of the
Commission's Rules Insofar as They Relate to the Industrial
Radiolocation Service, Report and Order, 5 FCC 2d 197, 202 (1966).
Through payments to an information provider or destination entity
(other than standard settlement payments), a carrier would abandon
objectivity and acquire a direct interest in promoting the delivery of
calls to a particular number for the provision of a particular
communication.  This precept applies regardless of the particular
dialing sequence used to place calls.  Also, any carrier that is
involved, either directly or indirectly, in blocking access to the
called number by other carriers or in determining or influencing the
content of the communications delivered through its network is not, we
believe, offering a common carrier service.  We recognize that long
distance carriers lawfully assign numbers in limited circumstances and
are the sole carrier to transport calls to such numbers.  Restricting
access to a particular telephone number that has been assigned for
access by multiple carriers, however (or creating fictitious numbers),
so that calls to that number can be completed only on one carrier's
system is anticompetitive and an unjust and unreasonable practice,
because that action deprives consumers of their right to use their
preferred carrier.  

A carrier may lawfully provide service to information providers is
only if it has absolutely no involvement or interest in the
communications made through its network and does not engage in any
action to encourage calls to a particular number or limit access to
that number to callers using its transmission services.  In summary,
in the service scenarios you describe the carrier would appear to be
providing an enhanced service, not a basic common carrier communications 
service.  Accordingly, imposing tariffed charges for the service would
be an unjust and unreasonable practice under Section 201(b) of the
Act.  This conclusion is reinforced by the implication that your
clients apparently plan to deliver calls only to a limited group of
people (information providers), rather than making their service
available to call any number at competitive rates using standard
communications operator and billing procedures.

     The services you describe are also unlawful under Section 228 of
the Act and the Commission's implementing rules.  It appears from your
description of the proposed services that your clients desire to
operate within the "tariffed service" exception to the definition of
pay-per-call service, and thus evade the letter and spirit of those
provisions and the important consumer safeguards for information
services.  The Commission is committed to eliminating abusive
practices which deprive consumers of their statutory rights concerning
such services.  Although Congress exempted from the pay-per-call
definition services that are provided on a tariffed basis, we do not
believe that the service you describe is encompassed within that
exception.  The fact that the consumer does not directly pay the
information provider does not exclude the service from the definition
of pay-per-call if the payment is simply paid to the information
provider by the carrier and then recovered from the consumer through
the transport charge.  In this case, the transport tariff is a sham;
the consumer has, in fact, paid the carrier for transport and the
provider, albeit indirectly, for the information.  Section 64.1506 of
the Commission's rules requires that such calls be provided only on
the 900 service access code.  Clearly, Congress did not intend that
the carefully crafted provisions of the TDDRA and Section 228 of the
Act could be evaded by the arrangement you describe.

      The payment of commissions in this instance is not comparable to
carriers' payments to aggregators such as pay telephone owners.  Those
commissions simply compensate aggregators for their costs of making
services and facilities available to the transient public for its
communications need.  See AT&T's Private Payphone Compensation Plan, 3
FCC Rcd 5834, 5836 (Com. Car. Bur. 1988), recon. and review denied, 7
FCC Rcd 7135 (1992).  The Commission has found that such commissions
are a legitimate business practice so long as callers are not
prevented from using any other carrier to place a call.  Id., National
Telephone Services, Inc., 8 FCC Rcd 654, 655 (Com. Car. Bur 1993).  In
contrast, the proposed payments to information providers are expressly
designed to evade the consumer safeguards set forth in the TDDRA and
the Commission's rules.

     Finally, we note that carriers are issued certificates of
authorization under Section 214 of the Act when the Commission
determines that such issuance serves the public interest and
convenience.  We believe that the inherently evasive and anti-consumer
and anti-competitive actions that you describe are contrary to the
Section 214 mandate applicable to carriers providing international
service even absent specific violations of the Act and the
Commission's rules.  For example, assigning a 500 number to an
information provider for termination in a country where the
terminating carrier pays the provider to route calls to that location
would be, in the staff's view, inconsistent with the public interest
mandate in Section 214.  Thus, entities who have applied for or hold
such authorizations may place such applications or authorizations in
jeopardy if they conduct such activities.

     Because the staff believes that the calling arrangements you
describe would violate Sections 201(b) and 228 of the Act, and would
be inconsistent with the public interest considerations set forth in
Section 214 of the Act, we need not address the manner in which the
calls may be billed.  Carriers may not bill subscribers for unlawful
calls.

     This is a staff ruling issued pursuant to Section 0.291 of the
Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.291.  Applications for review must
be filed within 30 days of public notice of this action.  See 47
C.F.R.  1.115.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Very interesting, indeed!  Does this mean
that those services operating under what has been called 'The Nevada Plan'
are now illegal?  Is it now the case that all those dial-porns operating
out of Netherland Antilles, Guyana and elsewhere are going to have to
make it on thier own without their kickbacks from AT&T and the other 
carriers?  Are we now to assume that direct delivery of long distance
traffic direct from a carrier to a subscriber via T-1 -- eliminating the
possibility of non-subscribers (to that carrier) from reaching the called
party -- are now illegal?

Now, what will happen if a subscriber changes his legal status from that
of 'subscriber' to that of 'telco'?  By that I mean the telcos have
always exchanged traffic among themselves and compensated each other for
traffic carried through the others' facilities, etc.  Suppose instead of
being just an end-subscriber accepting traffic who is no longer able to
receive commissions from an LD carrier I become a telco and expect to be
paid for the traffic the LD carrier delivers to me for processing? Suppose
at my telco, my two (and only two) 'subscribers', i.e. the two women who
work the phone room are only allowed to make outgoing calls on a collect
basis, and I, as telco, file a tariff charging thirty dollars per minute.
My subscribers return calls to their clients -- on a collect basis of
course -- and I submit my billing tapes in the usual way. 

For example, heretofore, I 'reached out and touch a new friend' on a
conference bridge operating in Nevada expecting only to pay toll with
no additional charge. The carrier took care of compensating the bridge
tender with a kickback from toll -- now deemed illegal.  Suppose now I
take your call of one minute or less duration and I advise you that 'your
call will be returned in one minute or less, on a collect basis, using
the services of the Bridge Telephone Company. All you need to do is
accept our collect call when your phone rings.'  Now the bridge tender
uses the telephone company which he owns to place calls to customers
on a collect basis at the rate he establishes. Presumably that will be
legal, where the (in my opinion) more straightforward kickback from
toll paid by the carrier is not?

Can it be then, that the clients of Integratel who do in fact go through
the formalities of actually calling back collect (as opposed to simply
converting the billing method in mid-stream) are operating legally?   PAT]

Subject: An Idea for LECs to Communicate Area Code Splits Nationally


Toby Nixon's post about the upcoming split of the 305 area code, made me
remember an idea I've thought about that LECs could use to communicate
area code splits nationally. 

Phone companies like NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, and presumably all the
others spend a lot of money communicating area code splits within their
regions, such as ads in the local newspapers which detailing the changes
in exchanges, and at least with Bell Atlantic, putting (I seem to 
remember) printing on the back of the phone bill envelope listing the 
exchanges that were now part of the new area code.  

Why don't the LECs work together to use the billing envelope to
communicate area code splits nationwide?  Sure that might not get to
everyone who needs to know in a business, but it would get the word
out to most every household in the U.S., for probably not that much
money when you think about.

For example, the September phone bill envelope I get from Bell Atlantic
could break out the 305/954 split, and list the exchanges that are now
going to be in 954. BellSouth could do the same for the 703/540 split in
Virginia, etc.  I could then check my databases, address books, etc. 

Although printing a special insert would be expensive, and unfortunately, 
probably ignored by many, I don't think people would ignore the actual 
envelope, and the printing on it.

Similarly, there could be a statement on all the envelopes about the
new types of area codes like "334" and why organizations need to take
steps to deal with the implications to their calling systems.  Then
there might be fewer problems down the line.  Although I guess with
Ft.  Lauderdale getting one of those kind of area codes, most
businesses won't let it slide anymore -- cf "I don't call Alabama
anyway, why change our phone system now?"

Just a thought that BELLCORE ought to look into.

Subject: # Means #; Number Means a Telephone Number
Date: 12 Sep 1995 17:59:59 GMT
Organization: Tulane University


With the recent thread of the '#' button's name, I have a gripe about
some people who post to TELECOM Digest and use phrases such as
'Calling an 800#'. PLEASE, please when wanting to abbreviate the
phrase 'Telephone Number' or 'Number' or NXX-XXXX or 'seven digits',
PLEASE don't use '#'.

The '#' is *also* a SPECIFIC touchtone button which has special purposes in 
numbering/addressing or telco functions (as well as private voicemail, auto 
attendant, etc).

For telco, '#' will time out a central office register when dialing
*variable-length* strings, such as NX-# instead of NX and waiting -- in
some Custom Calling applications -- # will indicate 'end-of-dialing' on
international strings. There is also 10-XXX-# 'cut-thru' dialing, and
one can get their Operator without having to wait for a time-out with
0-# (LEC) and 10-XXX-0-# (IXC indicated by 10XXX). 0-# does NOT
indicate zero plus the number- It means ZERO-POUND (or whatever you
call the '#' button).

'#' as a first entry key has been proposed (by Bellcore) for 'Facility
Codes' of the form #-XX. The 'XX' indicates a type of circuit or
transmission facility request, such as broadband, video, etc. #-56 is
proposed for requesting a 56 kbps circuit. Note that the other #-XX
codes aren't really assigned (yet) and there might possibly be no
standardization of their assignments/uses. I don't know what equipment
or codes ISDN users go by, but ISDN might just obsolete any plans for
#-XX facility codes, however.

For Historical Interest:

Back in the later 1960's (and early 70's), when AT&T/Bell-System was
planning on a future Picturephone service (the CRT type with Co-ax
loops/trunks), they planned on an initial '#' button to request a call
with the video loop as well as the regular audio telephone loop. One
would have called another picturephone as #-(1)-NPA-NNX-XXXX, local
picturephone calls as #-NNX-XXXX, and a Picturephone Assistance
Operator as #-0-(#). Service calls to Picturephone Information or
Picturephone Repair would have been dialed #-N11. Calls to regular
voice, non-video numbers, operators and services would continue to
have been dialed as normal, without the initial #. (The initial '#'
would also control AMA billing, as use of the video loop was charged
more than just the audio).

When abbreviating, lets try to say something like 0+num. or 0+nmbr. or 
0+A/C+num. for 0-NXX-NXX-XXXX (etc).

Just my 2-cents for the day, Pat.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I use my heavy-handed editor's red pencil
to change that notation when it appears here. I get a lot of messages
where people write something like "I tried to call that #" ... and I
*always* change '#' to the word 'number' before releasing the article.

Speaking both of Picturephone and 'adult' information providers in the same
issue as we are this time, I am reminded of the fellow down in south Florida
who experimented with this for a few years in the 1980's. This guy was an
oldtime 'swinger magazine' publisher -- a 'paper dealer' as we used to call
them. You submitted ads and photos to his little magazine and he ran them
along with others. Then of course he made a commission as the reader/writers
exchanged personal correspondence based on the ads in the magazine, all
of which had to be forward through his remail service, at least the first
time. If a 'woman' (hint, hint! like the games they play on Compuserve CB
at night) submitted her picture and message to the magazine, she could be
assured of getting *TONS* of mail in her post office box a couple months
later from men all over the USA with various lewd photos and letters in re-
turn. This guy made his money from all the ten dollar fees to run your
picture and message in the magazine along with the one dollar bills
received to forward your response to the advertiser. He got paid from both 
directions. He decided one day to get into picturephone one day with live
people at his end who would chat and display themselves to callers.  

He bought up a huge surplus of the 'slow scan' type picture phones; the
ones that only change their image every ten or fifteen seconds. He offered
these on a purchase or lease basis to the subscribers of his magazine or
said they could purchase their own from whatever source, and of course
with billing approved by your credit card company, you could call in to chat 
with (and view) other members of his club ... I don't know whatever came of 
it or how successful it was, but it occurs to me if some of the present-day
adult information providers got into picturephone there could be a lot of
money in it. 

Do you remember how, many years ago -- nah, you are all too young to
remember -- when tape players and cassette players were very new, how
the Columbia Record Club offered to send you a portable tape cassette
player -- for free, mind you! -- if you promised to join the Club and
purchase some minimum number of tapes each year?  More people got their
first tape cassette player (this was back in the era when we were seeing
a conversion from the old 'wire recorders' to magnetic tape recorders,
in the early 1950's) as a free gift from the Columbia Record Club (later
renamed the Columbia Record and Tape Club; nowdays Columbia House or
perhaps CBS Products, but still in Terre Haute, Indiana) by sending in
those coupons found in magazines and the Sunday papers ....

Battery operated tape players were the rage when I was in high school;
little pieces of magnetic tape in a case that would unwind onto another
spool and play the music therein ... more people became aware of that
'new technology' in the fifties because of taking the bait and signing
up with Columbia Record Club ... and please check the box if you want
classical, country and western, or whatever. I think you had to promise
to buy one tape each month for two years from the 'club magazine' sent
to you in the mail each month. If you did not return the card they sent
then you got the tape they selected and got billed for it anyway.

Now it occurs to me that if the telcos would really like to see picture
phone take off in a big way, they should cut a deal with the adult IPs
in a similar way. The IP could start a club and offer to supply picture
phones to new club members either free or at a greatly reduced price in
exchange for the new club member's promise to use the IP's services on
some regular basis. "Phone our service and chat with us at least once
each week for a year and we will send you at no charge a picturephone to
use when you call, because the young ladies and gentlemen here want to
be able to show you what they are doing as they chat with you about it."
Probably they would bill your credit card for a few hundred dollars and
send you the picturephone, then give you credit toward a certain number
of minutes/hours of service with them in the process. The IP's would
cut a deal with telco to get the units as cheap as possible, in the
same way Columbia Record Club cut a deal with (I think it was) the old
Zenith people to get those portable radios with the tape players built
in.  

The obvious drawbacks: the IPs would need to have legitimate people
there, and not the nasty ones (in real life) they use now.  grin.    PAT]

In situations where compelled signalling is used on one stretch of the
network, and non-compelled on the next, the switch that implements
this tandem function needs to know the exact number of digits or
implement a timeout (and leave the principle of compelled signalling).

Let me give you a specific example. A large Belgian organisation has
its own private network, which it uses for least-cost routing. This
private network uses R2 signalling (compelled). The PBX that routes
calls it receives from the private network back onto the public
network needs to know how many digits to expect, so that it knows when
to send the backward A-6 signal to indicate end-of-dialing instead of
the A-1 signal that asks for the next digit. This is needed both in
case the PBX is connected to the public network by means of analogue
trunks, and in the ISDN T0/T2 case where en-block sending is used.

If this PBX does not know the number of digits to expect, it must
always send the A-1 signal anyway, and send a pulsed A-6 signal if no
additional digit has been received within a timeout (see Q.442). This
is however an ugly kludge that can cause problems, both in the
signalling and in the ergonomy of the user.

We luckily don't have to struggle with this problem, since the Belgian
numbering plan is closed. However, if the private network is ever
going to be used for international least-cost dialing, we'll have a
problem ...

You are quite right that this works fine if the signalling system is
compelled end-to-end.

Is this truely how it works?  I can understand the written logic of
it, but see problems is several areas (1) dymanic routing of calls (2)
the anticipated 'number transportability' (3) routed calls like 800-
500-, etc.  It seems like in the above situation, the full number
would be required -up front-, or, as you mentioned, there would need
to be some time-out mechanism or 'end key' (like a #, *, etc), to
signify termination of the sequence.  Then again, I could easily be
all wet. If all numbers are available from the start, it seems like
the routing sequence would have less traffic than if there were a
continual transmission of the 'next' number involved in the dialing
sequence.  It seems to make sense logically.  But it also seems to
make sense that, at least currently, all numbers are required before
the sequence starts or wouldn't things like trunk busy signals, the
recordings about 'all circuits are busy' etc., come before we finished
dialing all the numbers? instead of waiting until all digits are
dialed first? (I remember some cities didn't require '1' before
dialing long distance, but I believe that's no longer true, so that
one is moot.)

Coming from the old crossbar, strowger switches as a kid, that seems
easier.  But even then, number lengths were fixed locally in my
hometown.  Five digit numbers were private lines or pbx's, six were
always party lines (same as five digits, and last was used to
differentiate the frequency of the ringing current to ring the correct
party).

Within the North American phone system, telephone numbers must be of an
easily predictable length.  That is because much of the hardware in our
switching system is designed with the requirement that the originating
switch know when the subscriber has finished dialing, without inquiring
of the terminating switch.

Here is a sketch of what happens in North America when you dial.  The
letter N represents a digit other than 0 or 1.

011 - international call, expect minimum 7, maximum 12 digits to follow.
      Dialing must conclude with time-out or # key
01N - international call, but operator assisted; as above
00  - long distance operator; no further digits permitted
0   - local operator; dialing requires time-out or # key
11  - special service code -- exactly two digits follow, then restart
      dialing sequence.
10  - carrier selection code -- exactly 3 digits follow, then restart
      dialing sequence [this does not account for 101XXXX codes]
0N  - operator-assisted call, expect 0-NXX-NXX-XXXX
1N  - direct-dialed call, expect 1-NXX-NXX-XXXX
N   - examine first three digits for special cases (911, 411, etc., and
      in some areas an area code in the local area; in each of those
      cases, the number of digits to be expected is determined from the
      first three numbers dialed); otherwise, local number: NXX-XXXX

The only cases I know of where the total number of digits expected
cannot be determined from the first three digits dialed are
international calls (length varies) and in some areas the special case
141, which may be 1+411 or 1+41X-NXX-XXXX.  (In Southwestern Bell
territory, you dial 1+411 because there is a charge for the call.)  In
any case, with the exception of international calls, the number of
digits expected is known within the first four digits of dialing.

The advantage of this scheme is that the originating switch does not
need to open a path all the way to the terminating switch until dialing
has been completed.  The originating switch stores the entire number and
then opens a path and sends it along its way, or may open a path part
way through the dialing process and pass the initial digits and then
pass the remaining digits in real time.  In either case, it knows when
dialing is complete and can take the dialing register off that line.

Other countries have systems that use variable-length numbers without
requiring time-outs, because they open the path as the subscriber dials
and the terminating switch returns an indication that dialing has been
completed.

So, in sum, variable-length numbers work fine in systems designed for
variable-length numbers.  They work terribly in systems designed for
fixed-length numbers.  In order to use variable-length numbers in the
North American system, we would have to replace large segments of our
switching system.  We could implement a scheme that said, for example:

1212, 1213, 1214, 1312, 1314, 1305, 1713 -- eight digits follow
all other 1-NPA combinations -- seven digits follow
and program each local switch to know whether local numbers are seven or 
eight digits.

This would allow each area code to have EITHER seven-digit or
eight-digit local numbers, but not both.  That would require analyzing
at least five digits to determine expected length.  The other problem
with this scheme is that permissive dialing would be essentially
impossible: all numbers would have to be splash-cut at once in the
affected cities.

The other minor impediment is that not only every local C.O. switch
would have to be reprogrammed, but also every single PBX in North
America.  Given that we've seen how well PBX managers bury their heads
in the sand when faced with something as simple as NXX prefixes and
NNX area codes, expecting them to cope with eight-digit numbers in
some area codes would be a bit of a reach.

Subject: Split of 314 (Missouri) NPA


A Bellcore Letter received today announces the split of the 314 NPA and 
creation of the 573 NPA.  Here is the text of the letter.

Letter Number: IL-95/08-015
Type: Informational
Date: 8-31-95
Title: NANP-Split of 314 (Missouri) Numbering Plan Area (NPA)
To: Recipients of North American Numbering Plan (NANP) information
Entitled Companies: Unrestricted
From: J. N. Deak - North American Numbering Plan Administration
Abstract: This IL provides industry notification of the impending split 
of the 314 NPA

We have been advised by Southwestern Bell Telephone Company that
substantial telephone number growth in the eastern half of Missouri
necessitates splitting the existing 314 NPA and the simultaneous
introduction of a new 573 NPA.

The St. Louis metropolitan area will retain the 314 NPA; Jefferson 
City, Columbia and the other towns in outstate Missouri will change to 
the 573 NPA.

The split of the 314 NPA, and the beginning of a permissive dialing 
period, will take place 11:59 PM CST on Sunday, January 7, 1996. The 
permissive dialing period will end 11:59 PM CDT on Sunday, July 7, 
1996. During the permissive dialing period, either 314 or 573 will be 
acceptable in a dialed number terminating in the new 573 NPA. After the 
permissive period, calls dialed with incorrect NPA codes, as defined in 
the NPA split information published in the Local Exchange Routing Guide 
(LERG), will be routed to intercept.

All international and domestic carriers are asked to ensure that the 
new 573 NPA has been activated throughout their networks prior to 
January 7, 1996. A test number for the new 573 NPA will be established 
on or about December 15, 1995. The test number will be 573-792-8378. 
Local exchange carriers, alternative access providers, PBX equipment 
vendors and others are also being asked to make this number available 
to business customers by the start of permissive dialing.

The attached map [not included in this message] illustrates the 314 and 
the 573 NPA configuration after the split. A listing of the communities 
to be served by each area code after the split is also attached.

The dialing plan for the new 573 and 314 NPAs will be the same:

* All home NPA (HNPA) "local" calls will be dialed on a 7 digit basis 
with no prefix; i.e., NXX+XXXX (7 digits).

* All HNPA direct dialed "toll" calls (generally calls that incur an 
additional charge) will be dialed with a prefix "1" and 10 digits; 
i.e., 1+HNPA+NXX+XXXX (10 digits).

* All foreign NPA (FNPA) direct dialed "toll" calls will be dialed with 
a prefix "1" and 10 digits; i.e., 1+FNPA+NXX+XXXX (1 + 10 digits).

* Operator assisted calls including credit card, collect, and third 
party calls will be dialed with a "0" prefix and 10 digits; i.e., 
0+NPA+NXX+XXXX (0 + 10 digits).

[Transcribers note: the letter does not mention FNPA local calls; 
perhaps there won't be any after the split.]

Questions of a technical nature should be directed to Pam Rak, 
Southwestern Bell, on (314) 957-1604. General questions should be 
referred to Lynda Meyer, Southwestern Bell, on (314) 957-6804.

Copies of this letter are being forwarded to achieve the widest 
possible industry distribution and may be reproduced for further 
distribution as needed. Questions concerning the contents of this 
letter may be referred to Jim Deak, Bellcore, at (908) 699-6612.

I recently logged onto the US Robotics BBS and found the files necessary

        What standard does this faster data rate follow.  I would guess
it is USR or Rockwell proprietary, or is it a V.34+ from ITU?

        Does anyone know anthing about V.34+ or V.34 annex A?  Where

        Last, is anybody aware of which companies have filed patents for or

Subject: Need Advice on a Norstar PBX Upgrade
Date: Tue, 12 Sep 1995 04:58:33 GMT


Hi, folks, this is my first post in a long time ... my old
UUCP-connected 486 has stopped working, so I'm stuck using Netcom's
overloaded machines for now.  I have a little problem with my Northern
Telecom Norstar switch.  We're now at about two dozen incoming lines,
half voice incoming and outgoing to the PBX, and the rest dedicated to
things like fax machines.  Our company is expanding like crazy.  We're
rapidly coming to the end of usefulness of this PBX in terms of
extensions.  The other problem we're having is that our long-distance
bill is enormous: over the last two months, we've averaged $5.3k, a
great deal of which consists of calls to France.  (This works out to
about $300 per employee, an astonishing figure!).  So, as a side task,
I've been looking into whether digital entrance facilities would help
lower the cost of long distance.  AT&T's guesstimate is that it could,
but we have to know the cost of upgrading the PBX.

My question to the audience: has anyone done this recently?  Do I have
to replace the whole shebang to make it work?  Is there some add-on I
can use without throwing away the existing hardware?  We OWN this PBX,
so leasing equipment also entails selling off what we have.  Are there
more cost-effective systems than the Option 11 switch, the next step
up from Northern Telecom?

Thanks for any input.

Any information that anyone may have would be of a tremendous help.

        Q1) If telecom reform legislation continues and the RBOCs are
allowed back into the 'long distance' game, how are the RBOCs going to
compete? For example, Bell Atlantic has created a subsidiary Bell
Atlantic Long Distance, Inc., but Bell Atlantic has neither a network
or facilities outside of it's territory. How, therefore, will they
carry and switch traffic across the country?

        Q2) Do any of the other RBOCs have an equivalent entity to
Bell Atlantic's subsidiary Bell Atlantic Long Distance, Inc? If so,
what are they?

        Q3) How can companies such as Bell Atlantic Long Distance,
Inc. plan to compete against such traditional carries as AT&T and
Sprint?

        I know these questions are somewhat broad, but I'ld appreciate
any information or advice that anyone may be able to supply.

Here is a press release from Essential Information.

I downloaded the press release from the U.S. Newswire BBS in Maryland
at (410) 363-0834.  I do not work for or belong to Essential
Information or the organizations that signed this letter.


Jack Nicklaus, GTE Tee Off Mexican Community, National Park

Contact: Andrew Wheat of Essential Information, 202-387-8034

   WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 -- Seven U.S. and environmental leaders called
on Jack Nicklaus and GTE to withdraw support for a controversial
recreational, residential and business development slated to be built
on national park land near Cuernavaca, Mexico.

   The letter to GTE Data Services President Don Hayes and golf
course designer Jack Nicklaus reads in part:

   As you know, the "El Tepozteco" development would be a
multi-purpose luxury residential, recreational and business
development eight miles south of Cuernavaca in the state of Morelos.
It is estimated that Tepozteco's golf course alone will consume more
than 4,000 cubic meters of well water a day, about five times the
amount of this scarce resource than the entire town of Tepotzlan now
consumes. Community members are also cncerned about the golf course's
expected heavy use of agrochemicals and the potential for them to
enter the water table and harm the region's rich bio-diversity.

   Another reason that El Tepozteco -- which would cover 187 hectares
with 800 luxury homes, a five-star hotel, a business park, a
helicopter pad and recreational facilities -- is so controversial is
because it would be built on unusually beautiful land 45 miles from
Mexico City, land that has legally enjoyed multiple layers of federal
protection. El Tepozteco's site sprawls across land that has been
federally recognized as:

     El Tepozteco National Park;
     Ajusco-Chichinautzin biological corridor; and
     "communal property" of 800 local "comuneros."
     ...the financing of the entire project hinges on GTE's

Subject: Bell Canada to Close Five Toronto-area Operator Locations
From: ndallen@io.org (Nigel Allen)
Organization: Internex Online, Toronto


Bell Canada's Toronto-area operators learned yesterday that the
company plans to close five Operator Services offices in Metropolitan
Toronto by the end of the year.  Two of the offices (both located at
Main Square, near the intersection of Danforth Avenue and Main Street)
are located in rented premises. The others are in Bell-owned
buildings. I'm not clear whether the offices being closed provide
directory assistance, long distance services or both. I'm also not
clear whether other locations outside Metropolitan Toronto are also
being closed.

Aggressive cost-cutting at other telephone companies, such as U S
West, has led to service quality falling below levels that regulatory
commissions would tolerate. I hope that Bell Canada can maintain
adequate service levels after these offices are closed.

No other number in the world (as dialed from North America) begins
with 911.  This makes it easy for the telephone switch to figure out.

Well, yes there is.  With the introduction of NPAs that look like NXXs
the switches now have to wait to see if any more digits are coming
before routing the call.  Although the prefix of 1, and the mandatory
ten digit dialing of intraLATA toll calls, generally makes it simpler,
the switches still have to watch out for those wierd combinations that
cause trouble.

I'm not sure I understand this one.  If all (or most) seven digit
numbers are in use (which is the only reason anyone would want an
eight digit number in the first place), then all eight digit numbers
would have the complication of having their fist seven digits be a
working station somewhere else.

In summary; eight digit phone numbers would not be significant problem
for state of the art telephone switches, but not all switches in North
America are state of the art. The majority of telco switches are state
of the art, but not all.  Variable length numbers would be a nightmare
for private switch owners -- both equipment and administration.

I feel sure it would be a major administrative problem.  I'm not sure
the gain in phone numbers would be worth the hair pulling.  Let's just
add new NPAs for a couple of more decades until the telephone system
is replaced by whatever your vision is of the information superhighway.

I'd rather go to usually hitting "Enter" (for example "#") for all
calls.  Once you are entering more than about five digits, the chance
of accidentally skipping a digit or inserting a digit are fairly high.
The first is caught by a timeout.  The second is not caught.  I know
because my office phone contains a repeated digit (say, 234-567-8890)
so I get a lot of mis-directed calls from people trying to call any
234-567-890_ numbers.

It used to seem (to me at least) that most USA IVRUs (Interactive
Voice Response Units -- these don't usually respond _to_ voice, they
respond, _with_ recorded voice, to the caller entering DTMF tones --
touch tones) standardized on requiring "#" after a string of digits
has been entered.  It is becoming much more common for these to not
allow "#" after entries of fix-length digit strings, so I guess I'm in
the minority.

This is probably at least partially because Americans are used to
_not_ entering "#" after dialing numbers.  Of course, I often enter
"#" after dialing numbers either because they are international and
the calling card system and our PBX both must timeout otherwise or
because I got in the habit after a TelCo pamphlet on using those
"extra" features suggesting using "#" after each code so the feature
would be activated more quickly.

I recall some times when normal (local or national) calls seem to
have been connected faster due to my entering "#" at the end, but
I could have been mistaken.

Perhaps the cellular phone craze will change this as people have to
get used to hitting "Send" after they "dial" the number.

I cannot find much information on hooking up a cellular telephone to a
28.8 modem. The modem is INSIDE my home computer. The reason I would
like to connect such a strange combination is two-fold.

One, my local cell providers have a deal where I have free airtime
from 7 PM to 7 AM weekdays and all weekend. That's pretty much the
time I am likely to us my system to dial in work, AOL, the net etc.

Two, since my kids are getting older, I really don't want to tie up
the house line too much during the above time periods ...

                so

The problem thus far is I am getting the impression that the cable
that connects the modem and phone costs over $100!

Is this cable "active"? Isn't there just a TIP and RING signal hangin
out on the tiny connector (the phone I am looking at is a Nokia 2XX).

If its TIP and RING, why couldn't I find a suitable plug and make
my own cable?

Last but not least, do cellular phone systems have the bandwidth to
support 28.8 modems? My Supra usually runs at 26400 with a local
provider.

Actually, although later codes were "pretty much at random", the first
10 or so codes assigned were not. Remember (well, I do, at least) that
in the early fifties, "tone dialing" was MF, only available to
operators. The black 300, or 500, or 80 phone out there had a rotary
dial. As well, many of the trunks in place still used pulse dialing
for signaling information transmission.

Therefore, to minimize holding time in the incoming registers, the
area codes were assigned so as to have the fewest pulses associated
with the highest calling volume. Therefore, 212 was NYC (five pulses),
312 was Chicago (six pulses), LA was 213, Detroit was 313, Pittsburgh
was 412, Dallas was 214, Philladelpghia was 413, St. Louis was 314,
etc.

I remember the hoopla surrounding the introduction of DDD. Our serving
CO (Valley -823) was the first DDD exchange in the Pittsburgh area,
and the building was just a couple of blocks from home. There were
bands, speeches, ballons, etc. One day we lifted the phone to get
"Number, please", and the next day we could dial 9 digits (no "1"
access) to call my aunt who lived in LA.

Subject: Wierd Phone Problem
Date: Tue, 12 Sep 1995 19:44:50 PDT


I have an AT&T Cordless two-line phone, model 4952 and it's acting
strangely.

Tonight it started doing something I'm calling a double ring -- I've
never heard it before from this phone.  Both the base and the cordless
handset ring two short rings extremely loudly.  These repeat at regular
intervals, though farther apart than normal phone ringing.  Here's the
odd part: there is no call coming in and the visual line indicators do
not light!

So far it has done this four times tonight: three times I was on the
line from a different (corded) phone when it was happening, so it
can't be a telco generated thing.  The battery is completely charged
(there's an visual indicator of battery strength, and the audio
indicator is just a quiet beep).  One time I was able to stop it by
returning the handset to the base, but it may be a coincidence because
it didn't work the second and third times (eventually it just stopped).

The fourth time I was not on the line, but the line 1 light came up as
"in use."  I activated that line, and the phone stopped ringing but it
would not release the line for several minutes.

This is very un-nerving because the ring is incredebly loud, and not
knowing what it's from is starting to freak me out :-).

Any insights?

The "need" is quite simple.  In the USA, we do NOT use compelled
signaling on trunks.  Inter-switch signaling is sent en-bloc.
Therefore the originating switch MUST know that the ENTIRE destination
number is received, as it cannot "send more digits" when the receiving
switch asks.

That is how it works on a stepper, and with compelled signaling.  In
the North American network, with MF (pre-SS7) signaling, CCIS6 or
typical US SS7, it is not possible to pass on additional digits.  The
trunk is selected, the digits are sent, and that's it.  This was much
easier to implement with crossbar tandems, and is what everything else
was designed to meet.

Such overlap signaling is part of the ISDN user-to-network interface
spec, and is how telephone sets deal with the local CO, but
inter-switch trunk protocols in North America don't work like that.

The problem is that you can't actually go 28.8 on most lines, let
alone 33.6, because the required signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth
aren't there.  The 33.6 is based on running a higher baud (signaling)
rate than used at 28.8.  This requires either an analog hard-wire
connection (say, within a single 1AESS analog reed-relay switch) or a
very, very good codec that passes up to 3.7 kHz rather than the more
common ones that cut off around 3.4 kHz.

In a magazine test of 28.8's a few months ago, the AT&T 33 kbps modem
was able to to go that fast on maybe 5% of calls.  V.34 is the "end of
the line" for the vast majority of modems, and any faster speeds will
be of little use to most subscribers.  ISDN bashers will, of course,
be disappointed.

Based on what I know, only about 70 percent of the phone lines in the
USA are able to handle 28.8 kbps. That means that, if you pick to
lines randomly, on average you'll be able to establish a 28.8 kbps
connection in less than 50% of the cases. For example, when I use my
28.8 modem at home, I generally get only 26.4 kbps when calling a
certain number in the same area code.

And, by the way, 33.6 is not a standard yet.

If you're willing to dump the existing modems, try an integrated
T1/channel bank/modem pool product.  The two best are made by 3Com
Primary Access, San Diego, CA, 619-675-4100, and U.S. Robotics,
Skokie, Illinois, 708-982-5200.  Modem pools contain every modem

excellent diagnostics on the T1, but, it's not cheap.

USRobotics makes a rack system that interfaces DIRECTLY to one or two T1
lines into a single chassis which can be equipped with up to 48 modems.

ASCEND also makes a similar product, tho it's intended to interface
directly with up to 4 PRI ISDN lines (95B+D) It services analog
callers as well as isdn callers.

Point your web browser to http://www.usr.com or http://www.ascend.com

Have your checkbook ready.  Both products are deep in the five-figure
range.  Both products fall into the category of "nifty-keen" albeit
somewhat expensive. Definitely a class act and the way to go to get
around all the excessive D:A conversions associated with channel bank
use.

Either product comes highly recommended.

A week or two ago, an accident occured at a problem intersection near
my parent's house in Oradell, NJ.  And a few months ago, we had 911
installed in town.  So, I reach for the phone to report the accident.
Times before, we'd dial 261-0200 and get our town's police quickly.
But I dialed 911, and found that there was a delay in getting my
report to the town police.  Appears the 911 operator has to identify
what town I'm in, and then transfer me to my town's police.  Takes
about 1/2 minute.  "911, what's your emergency?" me: "there's an
accident at Oradell (ave) and Summit (ave)".  "Ah, hold on, I need to
transfer you to the Oradell police".  Then I told the Oradell police
"There's an accident at Oradell and Summit".  A couple minutes, the
cops show up.

I don't know if a half minute is that important in reporting an
accident (someone was injured) or a fire or some other emergency.
Think I'll dial up the 7D police number when another situation occurs.

This past week I was in Silverton Oregon (503-873, Local exchange
carrier: GTE NW) and attempted to call from a residential telephone a
number in Portland, Oregon (503-249, Local exchange carrier: US West).
Both locations are in the Portland LATA.

My experience has been it is cheaper to use my ATT card calling rather
than US West.  So, I dialed 10288-0-503-xxx-xxxx to use ATT.  I was
connected to a live operator.  I gave the card number and the operator
responded: "Thank you for using GTE".  Confused, I hung up and dialed
again and experienced the same process.  On the third try, I dialed
10288-0 and waited.  The operator answered GTE!  I asked for a ATT
operator and was cheerfully connected.

I would appreciate any observations.  Since the breakup, I have always
lived in areas served by a Bell company.  I have no personal
experience how independent telcos are suppose process calls.  Is this
the way it is supposed to work?  In my mind, at best this is a system
flaw and at worst it is fraud.


[Telecom Digest Editor's Note: There is no fraud going on nor any
system flaws.  Local telco operators often times process calls for
AT&T. When I went just now to check my bill for last month I found a
few calls which were entitled 'local area calls processed by AT&T on
behalf of Ameritech', and I found a couple others entitled 'Calls
processed by Ameritech on behalf of AT&T.'  I think it has to do with
whose calling card or billing you are relying on many times. For
example, when I make calls to my own 500 number from around this area,
they are always on the *Ameritech* part of my account with the
notation, 'processed by Ameritech on behalf of AT&T'.  You'd think they
would be on the AT&T page since its AT&T's program. Now if I call a
500 number outside this LATA, then the charges show up on the AT&T page.
When someone called my 500 number from outside the LATA and used a pin
so I would get billed, it showed up on the AT&T page ... and yet when
we conducted an experiment with me forwarding my 500 calls to their
second line (so that the call stayed totally in their LATA), when they
dialed my 500 line and used the same pin, once I got the bill it was
guess where?  On the AT&T page, despite it starting and ending in the
same LATA. However when he dialed it 1-500 so that it rang through
direct to his second line, that one showed up on his local telco account
as a 'call processed by NYNEX on behalf of AT&T'.     PAT]

<further text snipped- discussed the 800-555-1111 number to reach
'Canada-Direct' (similar to AT&T's USA Direct and other carriers'
direct to US access numbers when calling from Overseas/International>

I myself thought that the earlier posts regarding Calling Cards issued
by Canada's Stentor (and independent) telcos, namely Bell Canada, not
being accepted by AT&T was incorrect (though these days with divestiture, 
deregulation, and competition, you can't always assume the obvious anymore).

*Most* calling cards issued by Canada's telephone companies are
line-number based (similar to the local Bell and independent LEC issued
line-number based calling cards here in the US), although there can be
'non-line-number' based cards which are rather based on an RAO or CIID
code, which is a Bellcore (and Stentor, etc) North American numbering
standard which began under the AT&T/Bell-System days. Some competitive
Long Distance carriers here in the US *do* issue non-line-number based
(CIID) cards which are usually accepted by the local telcos on Intra-LATA 
calls placed through the LEC's TOPS operator facilities/services. 

Many LD carriers, however, issue cards or accounts which are NOT
interoperable with other carriers, not even the LEC's IntraLATA
service. Even AT&T has their 'True-Choice' card which is an optional
card one can get and is NOT part of the Bellcore/Stentor/etc.
standard, and is accepted ONLY by the AT&T OSPS facility. It can NOT
be used for IntraLATA calls which are placed via LEC's TOPS operator
services. AT&T DOES accept the standard 14-digit calling cards issued
by the local telcos throughout North America (whether line-number-based 
or not) if they conform to the Bellcore/Stentor standards for Calling
Card numbers. AT&T itself continues to issue a CIID format card (CIID
is a Bellcore standard, but is NOT based on the line-number).

BUT, what is this '302' code plus the (ten-digit?) Canadian telephone
number to access Canada from the US that Terry Flanagan refers to? I
only know of 302 as the standard North American NPA (area code) for
Delaware, although it is assignable as a NXX Central Office Code
within NPA's which are now using N0X and N1X codes. I've never heard
of 302+ to access Canada from the US!

Is 302 reserved as a standard when Canadian card users are calling
from Motel/Hotel/Hospital PBX systems (with AOSlime operators and Long
Distance) here in the US? I don't travel much, but I know that there
ARE many PBX systems in the hospitality industry with special codes to
reach the long distance carrier of the calling party's choice. And of
course there are 950-XXXX and 1-800- numbers which are 'supposed' to
be dialable (and free, but we know otherwise -- many people get an extra
charge on their room bill when they check-out) to reach the carrier of
their choice. And I think that there are ALSO motel/hotel PBX's (and
other business PBX's) which DO allow 9(or 8)+10-XXX(or 101-XXXX) +
0+ONLY plus the ten-digit-number. Those outgoing trunks are also
supposed to be screened by the carrier's operator or computer as hotel
PBX lines, and not to charge-back to the trunk but rather to a card/collect/
3rd-Party/etc.

Could it be that '302' is really part of a 950-XXXX (fg.B) number or
maybe a 10-XXX or 101-XXXX (fg.D) equal access over-ride code? I have
seen references to 10-363+ for Bell Canada, and other Stentor members
have their OWN fg.B/D access numbers/codes as well! (Competition
withIN Canada is here today, too!)

Subject: Re: An Idea for LECs to Communicate Area Code Splits Nationally
Date: 12 Sep 1995 22:18:11 GMT
Organization: Tulane University


Here in Louisiana (and other SCBell/BellSouth states?), business class of 
service customers DO receive a small page in their monthly bill showing new 
NXX codes within NPA's in Bell South states, whether the NXX is to a Bell 
South exchange or to an independent telco exchange. The idea is for PBX 
administrators to program in any necessary new dialing/code information. I 
know that NPA 334 was listed in these fliers back in late 1993 and during 
1994 as a new areacode for Alabama (SCBell/BellSouth). I don't know if any 
new NPA's for NON-BellSouth states have also been listed in those fliers.

BTW, there is usually a note in the flier which states that the complete 
North American Numbering Plan NPA and NXX information can be obtained (for a 
cost) from Bellcore and continues on with the areacode (and address?) for 
Bellcore's Traffic Routing Administration.

But I think that all local telcos within North America SHOULD give at least 
new NPA information for any new NPA's anywhere in the North American system. 
I remember when Virginia had their 703 split to 703 & 804 some 20+ years 
ago, South Central Bell's 'Louisiana Bell Notes' monthly bill insert gave 
that information. Yes, this was still when we had a 'corporate' Bell System, 
some 10+ years prior to Greene's divestiture of the Bell System, but let' 
remember that Area Code information is Carrier NEUTRAL! Bellcore is one of 
the 'co-ordinating' entities for North American telephony- It IS owned 1/7th 
each by the seven divested Regional Bell Corporations, but IT is part of the 
NPA assignments- and most people get their dialtone (or their phone rings) 
from their own local telco.

BTW, the local telcos DO give a US/Canada map of NPA's in the front of their 
local directories. However, in Louisiana (and other SCBell states?), there 
is a notice stating "Areacodes for places not listed..." (a small town not 
able to have its dot on the map or name in the list) "...can be obtained 
from *Directory-Assistance*." We get ONE free available call to 1-411 every 
month. Any calls above and beyond that (in Louisiana) are 31-cents. (and 
automated voice instructions are NOW being used here, too). Try calling 
1-411 and asking for an areacode for ANY town outside of your own 
state/lata (even for a MAJOR metro area) and you'll probably get the 
response that you should call your LD company! And, either lose your free 
call or chalk-up another 31-cents! (of course, you CAN demand credit). I've 
even dialed a single-0 and asked for NPA info. Instead of her connecting me 
with AT&T or asking me what carrier I wanted for a 00 operator, she just put 
me through to Directory and (if it answered) set it to charge me 31-cents 
PLUS a 30-cents 'Operator Assistance service charge'!!! (I did call and get 
credit, however!) I have mentioned this BLATANTLY ERRONEOUS information to 
the Public Service Commission (on a few occasions over the past 10 years) 
but nothing has been done yet! Is Bell just trying to charge 31-cents to 
people who are unwitting? I don't normally call 1-411 on my own anymore, but 
it only a few years ago, SCBell did NOT itemize your 411 calls with time & 
date. They gave you only the number of times you called 411 in that billing 
month (at 31-cents/call minus your one free) and the total amount! Even AT&T 
carried  (NPA)-555-1212 calls (when Bell did more of the AMA tracking for 
AT&T a few years back) were just 'lumped' togather. There was NO itemization 
for time, date, nor NPA-itself that was called. Now, AT&T does more AMA 
tracking of its carried calls, and it is itemized as such here in Louisiana 
on the AT&T pages of my monthly SCBell bill. But back to the (erroneous) 
instructions stating that Directory Assistance is to be called for 
'areacodes for places not listed'. People would be dialing Information 
(Directory Assistance), being told that they should call their long-distance 
company (and probably dialing single-0 anyway thinking that the 0 Operator 
is long-distance), being charged 31-cents since DA returned answer 
supervision to the AMA machine, and not finding out about the charge until 
they get their bill. If all 411 charges are lumped togather as a sum total, 
they would have a bit of a problem trying to determine WHY they are charged 
and getting credit. But is it because Bell really WANTS it that way!?!?!

My two-cents.  My views are my own, and not *necessarily* that of anyone 
else.

This is were you surmise wrong.  In Europe the digit length is not
extended when the number of phone numbers runs out but fairly long
before that time (in most cases no local number starts with a
particular digit).  For instance in Amsterdam we had for a long time 5
and 6 digit numbers.  5 digit numbers started with 5 and 6 digit
numbers with 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9.  The phone company was careful
not to assign any number starting with 35.  When a shortage of phone
numbers was imminent, all numbers starting with 5 got a 3 prepended;
this freed leading digit 5 (with leading digit 6 still free).  At that
time all numbers were 6 digits.  Still later new numbers were
introduced: 7 digit numbers starting with 5; so at that time there
were 6 and 7 digit numbers.  At *no* time a shorter number was the
initial part of a longer number.  The key is that you do not start
with longer numbers when all or most shorter numbers are exhausted but
that you allow a much longer time.

I would like to adjust that.  Most people all over the world do not
enter "#" after dialling a number.  I do not because I can't.  My
rotary dials do not have the ability to dial "#".  (Yes, I have two
telephones, both have rotary dials, can be quite bothersome with some
menu driven systems, but not with others.)  Still I never experience a
time-out.

Is already done routinely, mainly to avoid having to deal with guaranteedly
invalid numbers.

For example, two months ago I was blocked by my *local* switch from dialing
+44-701-xxxxxxx for a friend's "personal" number in the UK.  Now, I know the
UK is a "special case" since they've just had a big shake-up, but similar
blocking occur on invalid area codes in other countries; eg, I get a local
intercept if I try +1-0000000000 or +1-9999999999.

On the other hand, waiting for a five second digit timeout on an
international call isn't that big a deal -- calls to some places may
take another 20 seconds to start ringing anyway ... As far as I can
tell, depending on carrier, this is the default for most international
calls from here (dial, wait five seconds, click, local intercept).

Indeed.  I agree with your assesment of the different schemes but
would like to point out another difference.  If variable length
numbers are used by the system, the system also allows an intercept on
the first digit that violates a valid phone number.  For instance, if
I dial "1" overhere I get an immediate intercept.  Same happens with
all other digits except "0", "4", "5" and "6".  (Since we have gone to
seven digits local all local numbers start with "4", "5" or "6".)

But when going non-local there is a big advantage.  When I dial "0"
(non-local access) followed by "291" I get an immediate intercept
warning me that the area code is not in use.  This is because the
terminating "1" is not a valid part.  This is not done locally
but by the compelled forward and back-signalling of digits.  And it
makes it easy to add area codes.  There is only one switch that must
be updated; the switch that handles the initial part.  Compare this
to the US where due to late update of switches some of the new
area codes can not be dialled.

Cellular switches can handle call setup with variable length phone
numbers since the numbers are sent "en-bloc", eg. the number is
entered at a cell phone and then the SEND key sends the numbers in a
block over the air waves to the switch.

A landline switch with line terminations must provide inter-digit
timing, or the dialer must terminate the phone number with the
End-Of-Dialing indicator such as the # number on a touch-tone phone.
Rotary dial phones cannot dial #, so inter-digit timing is needed to
determine that no further digits are coming in. This timer is only
needed for variable length numbers that have conflicts such as:
312-456-1234 and 312-456-123. For this sequence, the inter-digit timer
is only needed on the 9th digit. The timer is typically set to 2
seconds, which means there is an additional 2 second call setup delay
for conflicting number sequences that are not terminated by a # digit.

This attribution looks wrong, but it does not matter.

What difference does it make to drug dealers whether or not they can
use the key pad?  I am not a drug dealer myself, and I do not have any
friends in that trade, but I am quite curious about this.

What is there in the basic procedure of dealing drugs as practiced in
high crime or any other area that makes it telecommunication
dependent?  I can see that you have to have a phone for carriage trade
clientel that wants delivery service.  Why do you need one to sit out
on a street corner and deal drugs or sex or anything else?  Are they
phoning in mastercard approvals?  Are they back ordering out-of-stock
products?  Are they checking customer references?  Are they getting up
to the minute price quotations from the Columbian drug exchange?  Are
they checking on drug interactions with the poison control center?  Do
they need it to call 911?  What are they doing on the phone that is so
vital to their trade?  Somebody please enlighten me.

Now it becomes more clear. The FCC has an ongoing investigation of
UNIVERSAL service. Lifeline was a wrong (but perhaps related) thought.

At the heart of the investigation are demographic revelations that
ubiquity of service is fast becoming a myth when gauged by the inner
cities.

Second to that is the pressure LECs, who are negotiating to let
competition into their markets, are putting on legislators and
comissioners around the issue of Lifeline service and forcing would be
competitors to both offer it and or to mandate contribution through a
universal service pool. As long as LECs must offer this service then
would be competitors must too. This alone would have an effect on the
capital structure of would-be competitors and serve to inflate their
rates.

It's not so much a way to earn a profit as a way to placate the
investigators AND to kill competitors' cash in one fell swoop and it's
all wraped / warped up with politics, and the war on drugs. There are
just too many arguments peircing the veneer like the lack of safety
(911), pocket dialers etc. for the war on drugs to be the full reason
for the elimination of so many PROFITABLE payphones.  It's typical,
and smart, telco style to get someone else to tell them to do what
they want to do anyway.

He did mention he was in the L.A. area when that happened.  I wonder
if he was in one of the GTE service areas instead of PacBell.  I grew
up in one, and they always 'disabled' the tone pad after the call was
made ... it was more the switch then 'intentional', if I recall. <On

+/- on the line when the party answered <though that was possibly on

but converted to pulse. They still use these switches in GTE land in
Indiana where I grew up. I woudln't doubt that they do still have
the ancient hardware in CA as well.

Pat -

Perhaps one of your readers could shed some light on a new company
called GeoTel.  As far as I can tell, they are developing a
software/hardware system that allows real-time, call-by-call routing
of 800 number calls.  For example, using a database lookup,
independent of the 800 number dialed, a call could be routed to the
dealer that served the customer last time, or deadbeat customers could
be routed directly to the collections department.  Looks like it works
nationally, and hooks directly into the signaling system of the
carriers.

I would be interested in hearing if any of your readers have used the
system, or have any experience with its reliability.

       Recently I got a notice in my AT&T Universal Card (Visa card)
bill that "any current AT&T Universal Card calling card discount will
no longer be available."  (My account provides -- or provided -- for a 10
per cent discount [from what?] on credit card calls made with the AT&T
Visa card.)

       Now "you'll be guaranteed competitive AT&T calling card rates
on your first $10 of qualifying calling card calls each month, and
enjoy up to 25 per cent savings when you make over $10 in qualifying
credit card calls."

       Note the "UP TO"; it doesn't say what "savings" is actually
applicable.  It probably depends on volume, but doesn't say so, or
what the lowest tier "savings" is and how much you have to use to get
25 per cent.

Subject: Beach House Payphone


A couple of weeks ago, I was vacationing at Corolla in the Outer Banks
of North Carolina.  The rental house I stayed in had an interesting
arrangement for phone service.

As you might imagine in a rental house, the phone did not allow 1+
dialing.  00 and 0+ calls went to an operator, but after that things
started to get more interesting.  10XXX0- and 10XXX0+ calls did not
complete and _certain_ 800 calls also did not complete.  The 800
numbers that were blocked included 1-800-OPERATOR, 1-800-CALL-ATT, and
1-800-COLLECT.

I did some additional checking and found that the operator services
were being handled by Teltrust (operators located in Salt Lake City).
The line restrictions and operator connections seemed to be accomplished 
via a dialer installed in the house by a company called ATI.  When I
spoke to the ATI customer service reps about the trouble I had dialing
certain 800 numbers, they said something about not having the 800
numbers "programmed in".  I have to believe that they are deliberately
"programming out" specific 800 numbers rather than programming in all
of the 800 numbers in the US.  The rep provided 800 access numbers for
AT&T and MCI which worked, but they weren't the well known ones.  My
more obscure 800 access number for Cable & Wireless long distance also
worked without a problem.

The Teltrust/ATI 0+ (credit card, no operator) rates for a call from
Corolla to Washington, D.C. (about 300 miles) were quoted as $2.75 for
the first minute and $.45 for each additional minute.  Not what I
would call cheap.

This caused me to wonder if this form of service (beach house, dialer
based, coinless payphone) is regulated?  If so, is the service
provider permitted to block or impede 800 access to other carriers?  I
suppose the service provider would claim it was still possible to
reach the other carriers even though most people would just give up
and dial 0+ after their initial 800 attempts didn't work.  To my mind,
this is another example of the ongoing war against consumers some of
the operator service providers seem to be engaged in.

Subject: Pacific Bell Pay Phones
Date: 13 Sep 1995 21:51:30 GMT
Organization: The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, Sausalito, CA


I want to respond on behalf of Pacific Bell to two postings: The first
was by Bob Jacobson on August 30 wherein he alleged that Pacific Bell
doesn't want to locate coin phones in high crime areas because these
phones don't bring in enough money.  He said telcos seek 'to maximize
profit by limiting service to high-security, high-spending venues
(like airports, upscale shopping malls, and tourist hotels).'

He added that a bill to remove coin phones was watered down (presumably 
at telcos' urging) to make it difficult for customers to interfere with a 
coin phone's removal by giving them little time to object.

First of all, it is an unwarranted assumption that coin phones in high
crime areas are not profitable.  In fact, if city authorities cause
Pacific Bell to remove a coin phone in such an area, a competitor, who
is not governed by the same rules as Pacific, frequently moves in to
claim the revenue.

When the Chicago City Council decided in October 1994 to ban outdoor
coin phones on residential streets, outside liquor stories and on
vacant buildings and lots, Pacific Bell voiced its opposition.
Pacific believes concerns about crime need to be balanced with the
very real need of people, especially those with low or limited
incomes, to have access to the local telephone network for local and
long distance calls and for reporting 9-1-1 emergencies. In some cases,
these pay phones are the only way people have to communicate with
others.

Pacific Bell has not removed any coin phone for the past five years
for providing a low payout or being unprofitable unless a site owner
has demanded it.

To keep its coin phones in areas having problems with public order,
Pacific Bell cooperates with police, neighborhood groups, and local
government to address noise, loitering and crime concerns.

Furthermore, where there is a public need but little likelihood a coin
phone would ever be profitable, another procedure exists to establish
what are called 'public policy pay telephones.'

Pacific is the only pay phone provider to install stations primarily
for public health, safety, and welfare where there otherwise would not
be a public phone.

Pacific Bell maintains some 900 of these in California including such
remote sites as along desert highways and mountain trails.  A few
years ago I looked at the cost of maintaining a policy phone booth out
in the Mojave Desert.  It ran close to $200 per month!  Users are few.
But when they need it, they need it indeed.

Concerning Jeff Gottlieb's experience -- where the (allegedly) Pacific
Bell coin phone in a Los Angeles restaurant had an inoperative touch
tone pad  -- , Mr.  Gottlieb was right when he said he didn't expect
that from Pacific Bell: We don't do that.  But he is not the first to
be fooled.  Competitors' phones often resemble ours.

Here are the countermeasures Pacific Bell applies to retain coin
phones in high crime areas: eliminate incoming calls; relocate the
station to a nearby but more observable site; install a lock-up box or
a cut-off key to confine use to specific hours; modify the existing
phone enclosure; install high intensity lighting; or convert to a
charge-a-call (calling card, collect, third-party billed) phone, and
establish remote call screening.  In the latter case we can deny
incoming calls, deny coin calls, deny calling card calls, deny
international dialing, and provide screening by time of day.

Anyone having further questions about PacificUs coin phone policies is
welcome to contact me directly.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Thanks very much for taking the time to
write to the Digest with this clarification. Here in Chicago, Illinois
Bell has likewise denied at one time or another that they tamper with
payphone arrangements -- as to location or number of phones; how the
phones operate, etc -- for any reason other than in response to concerns
voiced by the community and the police. And you are quite correct about
how 'slick' some of the competitors have become in making their phones
look *exactly* like Genuine Bell to anyone without a very trained eye.
They've done it that way on purpose, knowing that you always follow what
the winner is doing, and that the 'average user' won't know one operator
service from another, nor be in a position to make a sophisticated
response to the price gouging so many COCOTS engage in.     PAT]

Subject: UCLA Short Course: "Multirate Digital Filters and Applications"
Date: Wed, 13 Sep 95 09:53:00 PDT


On November 29-December 1, 1995, UCLA Extension will present the short
course, "Multirate Digital Filters and Applications", on the UCLA
campus in Los Angeles.

The instructor is Professor frederick harris, Electrical and Computer
Engineering, San Diego State University.

This course is an introduction to multirate digital filters, which are
variants of non-recursive filters, and incorporate one or more
resamplers in the signal path.  These embedded resamplers affect
changes in sample rate for upsampling, downsampling, or combinations
of both.  Changes in sampling rate as part of the signal processing is
a feature unique to sampled data systems. and has no counterpart in
continuous signal processing.  Benefits include reduced cost for a
given signal processing task and improved levels of performance for a
given computational burden.  This economy of computation has become an
essential requirement of modern communication systems, particularly
battery-operated equipment.

Specific course topics include: Introduction to sample rate
conversion, Non-recursive (finite impulse response) filters, Prototype
FIR filter design methods, Decimation and interpolation, Multirate
filters, Two-channel filter banks, M-channel filter banks,
Proportional bandwidth filter banks and wavelet analysis, Polyphase
recursive all-pass filter banks, Multirate filter applications.

The course fee is $1095, which includes extensive course materials.

On December 4-8, 1995, UCLA Extension will present the short course,
"Advanced Communication Systems Using Digital Signal Processing", on
the UCLA campus in Los Angeles.

The instructors are Bernard Sklar, PhD, Communications Engineering
Services, and frederick harris, MS, Professor, Electrical and Computer
Engineering, San Diego State University.

As part of the course materials, each participant receives a copy of
the text, "Digital Communications-Fundamentals and Applications", by
Bernard Sklar.

This course provides comprehensive coverage of advanced digital
communications.  It differs from other communications courses in its
emphasis on applying modern digital signal processing techniques to
the implementation of communication systems.  This makes the course
essential for practitioners in the rapidly changing field.
Error-correction coding, spread spectrum techniques, and
bandwidth-efficient signaling are all discussed in detail.  Basic
digital signaling methods and the newest modulation-with-memory
techniques are presented, along with trellis-coded modulation.

Topics that are covered include: signal processing overview and
baseband transmission; bandpass modulation and demodulation; digital
signal processing tools and technology; non-recursive filters; channel
coding: error detection and correction; defining, designing, and
evaluating systems; signal conditioning; adaptive algorithms for
communication systems; modulation and coding trade-offs and
bandwidth-efficient signaling; and spread spectrum and multiple access
techniques.

The course fee is $1495, which includes the text and extensive course
notes.

Subject: Cellular Service Along NY Route 17


I will be doing a lot of driving along Route 17 in New York State
(between Westchester county and the Finger Lakes region).  With the
coming Winter, I want peace of mind in case of roadside emergencies.

I was wondering if anyone knows what kind of cellular coverage exists
along the Catskills mountains region of Route 17 if I sign up with one
of the following two carriers: AT&T Wireless/Cellular One NY Bell
Atlantic/NYNEX Mobile.

Among the pros and cons of the two carriers that I am considering are 
the following (in decreasing order of importance):

- Bell Atlantic/NYNEX Mobile being the "second carrier," I may not
  get good coverage in all parts of Route 17 -- they couldn't tell me
  how good is their coverage;

- Bell Atlantic covers all of NY and NJ (I will pay no roaming 
  charges along NY Route 17); with AT&T, I will end up paying 99c/min
  if I use my phone outside my county;

- Bell Atlantic requires (or so the representative told me) that I use
  a Motorola Flip phone that they will sell to me, while with AT&T I can
  use any phone of my choice.

I'd appreciate any comments from those familiar with the area, or
those who use Bell Atlantic/NYNEX Mobile or AT&T/Cell One NY in
general.

[from press release via CNW]

ACC TELENTERPRISES ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF METROWIDE COMMUNICATIONS

TORONTO, Aug. 14 /CNW/ - ACC TelEnterprises Ltd. (ACC) has announced
that it has acquired Metrowide Communications. Metrowide is based in
Toronto and provides local and long distance services to Ontario
based customers. The purchase is expected to add over $10 million to
ACC's annualized revenue.

ACC is scheduling a teleconference at 2pm, today, August 14, 1995.
Parties interested in more detail on the acquisition are asked to
dial (416) 695-5801 five minutes prior to conference time.

Commenting on the acquisition, Steve M. Dubnik, Chairman, President
and CEO of ACC TelEnterprises said, "The purchase of Metrowide
Communications strengthens our ability to be all things to some
people. ACC's acquisition of Metrowide will add several significant
telecommunication services to the company's current product lines
including Centrex resale and wide area local calling. The fit between
ACC and Metrowide, in addition to its traditional long distance
services, is that while primary local service provides business
consumers with the ability to receive and place local calls at a
fixed monthly rate, it does not provide any of the advanced
telecommunication services of Centrex service or PBX equipment."

Metrowide currently buys Centrex services from Bell Canada in bulk,
and resells them at a discount to businesses that require under 100
local lines per office. The offshoot of Centrex provisioning allows
Enhanced Extended Area Service or EAS which is the expansion of local
free calling areas. Metrowide also provides packages for inbound
calling similar to a Foreign Exchange Service whereby the call is
free to the originating caller anywhere within approximately 30 miles
of Toronto. In addition, we expect this acquisition will have a
positive impact on operating cash flow and operating income in 1996."

ACC TelEnterprises Ltd. is a publicly traded telecommunications
holding company headquartered in Toronto. The stock is traded on the
Toronto Stock Exchange and the Montreal Exchange under the symbol
ACL. Business operations and service is provided across Canada by its
wholly owned subsidiary ACC Long Distance Inc.

ACC Long Distance Inc., together with its affiliates, ACC Long
Distance Corp. in the United States and ACC Long Distance UK Ltd. in
the United Kingdom, is a multinational provider of enhanced
telecommunications services. As one of the nation's premier
non-facilities based carriers, the company has an annualized revenue
run rate in excess of $110 million. ACC provides worldwide voice and
data long distance services to over 100,000 businesses and residential
customers in Canada.

Subject: Area Code News


Some news on the area code front:

The split of AC 904 in North Florida has been clarified.  Contrary to
earlier reports, the new AC created in the split will be 352 and not
850.  The southern part of AC 804 will become 352, the Panhandle
retains 904.  Daytona Beach (and Volusia Co.) were originally to be
moved to the new code, but the consortium of landline and wireless
companies planning the split decided to keep it in 904, at least for a
while.

    352 will contain Gainesville, Leesburg, Ocala;
    904 will retain Daytona Beach, Jacksonville, Panama City, Pensacola, 
       Tallahassee;

The split is effective 12/3/95 and the permissive period ends 5/20/96.

AC 320 has been assigned to the split of AC 612 in central Minnesota
(to take place sometime in March 1996).  Metro Minneapolis/St.Paul
will keep 612, the rest of Central Minnesota will move to AC 320.  As
part of the the 612/320 split, 5 communities SE of the Twin Cities
(the biggest of which seems to be Red Wing) will switch from AC 612 to
AC 507.

traffic, have been limited to a data rate of 9.6 kbs or lower.  The
enhancements to this product will improve performance dramatically.

The TC421 Transcoder is a part of the comprehensive DSC transmission
product portfolio, which is integrated via DSC's network management
line.  DSC is a leading designer, developer, manufacturer and marketer
of digital switching, transmission, access and private network system
products for the worldwide telecommunications marketplace.

DSC's new transcoder is one of many exciting products being announced
and displayed at Cellucomm 95.  If you would like information on
attending, e-mail 75260.710@compuserve.com or call 517-337-3995.

Subject: AT&T Phone Number Listing


A very common problem expressed by many people when trying to 'reach out
and touch someone' at AT&T who can address a specific problem or assist
with technical help is their inability to *actually get through* to
anyone who knows anything. Time and again, one will get shunted from one
location to another, from one department to another. 

With that in mind, I've compiled a listing of several numbers at AT&T
which you may want to keep as a permanent reference. Any additions or
corrections will be welcome.

All of these are 800 numbers unless noted **, in which case they are 908
numbers.

   ---------                 All are 1-800, then

I just wanted to start up a thread that I will be posting to over the
next few weeks, as the court battles over gerneral equal access
application play out.  This will be primarily of interest of large
users (with traffic in excess of $2,500.00) who want lower rates, and
the intelligent network services (isdn, T-1, ect) offered by the big
boys.  My company is not related to any long distance provider, so I
am hoping that the material to come will be unbiased.  By the way,
some of you smaller users may have some interest in this as well.
Equal access alllows smaller users to jump on reseller and aggregator
tariff, without putting up with the BS.  Find a good consultant who
knows tariff, and off tariff negotiation; and you will have a good mix
of price and service.

Subject: A Way to Introduce Eight-Digit TNs to the US
Organization: GoodNet
Date: Wed, 13 Sep 1995 02:45:15 GMT


We have all of these new area codes available with a lot of wide open 
spaces.  Why not try this:

When a area is ready for a "metropolitan split" (like the upcoming
312/774? or the possible split I have heard about for 818).  Instead
of slicing a portion of the area and splitting it up even more, take
the area code and change it to *two* NEW area codes where the first
two numbers are the same (like 953 and 954).  Existing telephone
numbers will be moved into one of the two area codes (for this
example, we will use 953).  If you are dialing within the affected
area code you will dial eight-digits (the last digit of the area code
and the seven digit number).  All new prefixes will go into the new
NPA and calls are still dialed the same.

Let's say my current telephone number is 311-867-5309, during the split, 
my telephone number will be changed to 953-867-5309.  If I was calling 
from within my area code, I would now dial 38-67-53-09.  Outside the NPA, 
I woudl dial 1-953-867-5309.  

My number would be displayed on letterhead, etc as (95)3-867-5309.

In the meantime, a whole block of NPAs would be reserved for this area
based on predicted growth.  For this example, NPA's 952 thhrough 959
can be reserved.

Of course, area codes ending with xx0 and xx1 would still be assigned to 
seven digit numbers.

During the permissive dialing period, if only seven digits are dialed, the 
switch will hesitate and time out and complete the call.   After the 
permissive period is over, calls will route to either a VCA or an 
informative recording advising of the new dialling instructions. 

Doing this will avoid those corporations that do not want to change their 
area code because **EVERYONE CHANGES THEIR AREA CODE!!!!**.  With this in 
place, an area can have the equivlent of seven area code splits in one area 
and a customer will not have to change their *10* DIGIT number. 

Of course, there where will be more public confusion than a normal
area code split (there are still Van Nuys customers who still think
they are in 213 (and I am not talking about FXS customers)).  But I
think the NP + 8D dialing system will be a long term solution for our
current area code crises.

I think for the electronic switches, there should be no problem with the 
translations, it's the electromechanical switches (they still have some 
of those) in the eight-digit areas that I cam concerned with.  

P.S. Why can't they do this with 800?  Reserve the whole 882-889 block
for toll free services and advertise the numbers as "88" numbers.
Including a possible mandatory change for existing 800 NPA numbers to
one of the 88x NPAs.  Maybe you can give existing customers a choice
for their first digit.  Example, 1-800-FLOWERS can be code
1-88-4-FLOWERS.

Hello Bellcore?  Hello FCC?  Anyone out there?

What do you all feel about this?

Subject: Bell Canada Tests "Soft" Dial Tone
Organization: Gateway: The Super Continental - North York, Canada 


[from Bell News, 4 Sept 95 - Bell Canada's version of events ...
the feature described may be in service elsewhere]

McMaster University students first to test our Soft Dial Tone - a new
way to set up phone service

We're holding a field trial for a new way of activating phone service,
and students living in residence at Hamilton's McMaster University are
going to be the first to test its effectiveness.

The two-month field trial of Soft Dial Tone began last Wednesday
(August 30).

That day, rooms in McMaster residences (Bates Residence excluded) were
provided with partially active phone lines.

Students need only to plug in a phone to obtain what sounds like a
normal dial tone.

What they are getting, however, is Soft Dial Tone.

With it, students can call 310-BELL (310-2355) from their residence
room to activate full service within four hours.

If they go to any Bell Phonecentre store, their order will be
processed in the standard way, and they will have phone service within
two days. (By dialing 310-BELL from any other location students will
also be able to initiate regular phone service.)

The benefit of Soft Dial Tone is that it saves students in residence
from making a visit to a Bell Phonecentre store to activate their
service.

A secondary benefit of Soft Dial Tone is that, in the event of an
emergency, students can call 911 emergency service without having
regular phone service during September and October.

Incoming and outgoing calls, however, can't be made with Soft Dial
Tone until full phone service is established.

Within the next year, field trials for Soft Dial Tone on single line
residential services are planned for residential and business
locations in Ontario and Quebec.

Depending on the results of the field trials, Soft Dial Tone could be
the standard approach to setting up phone service in businesses and
residences over the next couple of years.

Phone numbers are pre-assigned to the rooms which is an advantage for
Bell because we can make a positive confirmation that the line is
working. If the student calls 310-Bell from a residence room, the
service representative will automatically know the address of the
residence room.

McMaster University was chosen for the field trial because its
administrators saw the advantages it would offer to students,
including the 911 emergency service feature. The telecommunications
network at McMaster was also suitable for the field trial.

Subject: New Bell Canada Stored-Value Phone Cards
Organization: Gateway: The Super Continental - North York, Canada 


Bell News (4 Sept 95) has details on the introduction of the new Bell
Canada QuickChange payphone cards. Each of the new cards contains an
EEPROM (Erasable Electronic Programmable Read Only Memory) chip that
maintains a credit balance. The current balance of a card can be
displayed and deducted on specially- equipped payphones.

The pre-paid cards begin at a set amount ($10 and $20 value cards
will be available), then the balance stored on the card chips is
reduced as calls are made. Such "smart card" systems are widely used
in many countries, but are only beginning service in North America.

Bell's Millennium payphones are being equipped with a yellow-coloured
card reader. Three-quarters of campus payphones are reportedly
converted, since post-secondary students will be among the first to
have the new cards. A few other payphones around Toronto and Montreal
have also been converted. 15 000 payphones should be converted this
fall to accept the QuickChange cards, with conversions continuing
through early 1997. The card readers will also accept existing telco
calling cards and credit cards (such as Visa and MC).

The passes themselves will begin sales in central Ontario (416 and 905
area codes) beginning January 1996. Availability in other regions will
eventually follow. In Quebec, the French name for the cards is "LaPuce".

Currently, Bell Canada has the traditional calling card technology,
plus the Hello phone pass (a pre-paid card, based on access to an 800
number and an accounting system). The QuickChange card offers local
calls at 25c each, the same rate as coin calls; calling card local
calls cost 75c, while the Hello cards are unsuitable for local calling
at 50c/minute.

Bell Canada is also setting up a card collectors club, given the
burgeoning worldwide interest in telephone card collection. Special
deals, and members- only card issues are planned. According to Bell
News, the club is free and open to anyone. Information is available
at 1 800 404.7823 or fax requests to join to (514) 343.4133.

on Wednesday as part of an investigation into child pornography on America
OnLine. 

Management of America OnLine has, over a two year period, supplied the FBI
with the names and addresses of users 'suspected' of 'being involved in'
child pornography and/or arranging sex with children. The raids on Wednesday
marked the first time federal agents were called upon by an online service
to investigate the behavior of their subscribers in private chat rooms.

Attorney General Janet Reno spoke in support of the actions of America OnLine
and FBI agents, noting, "We are not going to permit exciting new technology
to be misused to exploit and injure children."

The raids were conducted throughout the day Wednesday in 57 of the 94 FBI
districts in the United States. They were mostly concentrated on the east
coast, however arrests and confiscation of computer equipment took place
all over the country in such diverse cities as Miami, New York, Dallas and
Trenton, NJ. Carlos Fernandez, an FBI spokesperson in Washington, DC said
that 'quite a few more arrests are expected in the next several days' and
that the Bureau would wait until those arrests had been effected before
discussing the case in detail.

Pam McGraw, a spokesperson for America OnLine, based in Viennna, VA admitted
that the company monitored email and private conversations seeking out 
persons who use their network to transmit pornographic material. She said
they always provide the FBI with the names of users suspected of involvement
in child pornography.

Ms. McGraw also discussed an online 'neighborhood watch' program in effect
on AOL where users are encouraged to oberve each other's activities and
report on them to management of the online service.

Although child pornography certainly is not allowed in public areas of AOL,
according to Ms. McGraw it 'usually is transmitted in email between users,
or in private chat rooms'. She did not indicate how AOL's interception of
email for the purpose of examining it for 'pornography' or their monitoring
of private conversations between subscribers could be reconciled with 
various privacy laws, apparently because it can't be. 

FBI spokesperson Fernandez said the federal investigation of AOL users
showed that child pornographers are turning to online networks 'more and
more' to lure curious children. He said, "the utilization of online services
and bulletin board systems is rapidly becoming one of most prevalent tech-
niques for individuals to create and share pornogrpahic pictures of children
as well as to identify and recruit children into sexually illicit relation-
ships."

Raids and arrests of other AOL subscribers 'suspected of being involved
in child pornography' will continue over the next few days until all the
user-suspects have been located.

I don't know about you, but I'm going to purge all the AOL sofware from
my computer today. Child porn does not interest me in the least, but
having AOL scanning my mail and checking up on my in private conversations
with other users there is of great concern. It is hard for me to imagine
how any online service could violate the trust of their users in this way,
by getting into their email and personal files, regardless of the intentions.

We have known for some time that AOL was 'cooperating' with federal agents
in their investigation of child pornography, but until the massive raids
and arrests commenced on Wednesday followed by AOL's admission that the
'evidence' was found in email and private chat, we did not know the extent
to which AOL was abusing their subscribers in the process of cooperating.

The main advantage of 911 is that the operator is able to determine
the address the phone call is beign made from. This way if the person
calling is unable to talk, either because of the emergency situation
or because speech impairemen, the 911 operator can dispatch emergency
vehicles to this address.

Yes, 1/2 minute makes a difference.  You can bleed a *lot* in 30
seconds.

Instead of dialing the 7D of the PD, you should be dialing the 7D of
the 9-1-1 authority and raising a stink.  Let them know that as a
taxpayer you're unhappy with the service.  E9-1-1 provides the town,
the system should be routing the call automatically to the appropriate
PSAP.  Raise a stink.

Subject: Re: Dialing 911 Instead of Police's 7D Number Slowed Things Down 


I do not know why the 911 system in Oradell, NJ is operating in the
way you describe.  The call should be routed straight to the proper
answering point based on the ANI of the originating party if your area
is served by enhanced 911.  A database which associates your ANI with
an answering point (gross simplification) is used to route the call.
This database is updated any time a change is made to a telephone line
(new service, delete service, move service,...)  The ANI is then
supplied to the answering point and is used to display the identity
and location of the caller (usually derived from the billing name and
address).

Generally, most 911 calls are routed to a police department responsible 
for the geographic area you are calling from.  Some 911 networks route
calls from a large geographic or densely populated area to a central
answering point and then dispatch the proper service from there.

If the system is set up properly, the operator who handles your call
should be able to transfer you directly to whatever service you
require by pressing 1 button.  Police, Fire, Ambulance, EMT,...  and
so forth can be connected to in a matter of seconds.  Why this took a
"1/2 minute" is beyond my comprehension.

There are a number of reasons why this wouldn't happen:

 1.) An ANI fail occurred while outpulsing to the switch responsible
     for routing your 911 call properly,
 2.) Your parent's ANI is not associated with the proper answering
     point in the database. 
 3.) Your parent's ANI is not in the database used to properly 
     route 911 calls.  This can happen for a number of reasons:
     - parents have just moved and database has not been updated yet,
     - parents are served by a telephone company or CAP that is
       different than the company that owns the database and the
       information has not or will not be supplied to the database.
 4.) Your parent's have a multiparty line and the proper ANI could
     not be determined,
 5.) Your 911 service routes all calls to a central location and 
     the calls have to be manually sorted out there (Basic 911?).

I suggest you call your parent's local telephone company and demand an
explanation.  Expedient routing of a 911 call may mean the difference
between life and death.  Notice that the 911 operator did not
specifically ask you for the city you were calling from according to
the dialog you supplied in your post.  Either the address you were
calling from was available to the operator or the operator was
somewhat familiar with the geographic area and assumed that the corner
of Oradell and Summit is located in Oradell, NJ.  How many Main
streets are there in NJ?

In order to save money, many municipalities are consolidating their
911 centers which means that the operators are being asked to handle
calls from larger and larger geographic areas.  At the same time, the
telephone companies are consolidating their 911 routing into just a
few switches for a whole state.  An article in the NENA (National
Emergency Number Association) News, Vol. 12 No. 4, November 1994,
showed that NJ has three (3) switches which are used to route 911
calls from 567 different municipalities and 3 different phone
companies (Bell Atlantic, Sprint-United, and Warwick Valley).

In almost every area of the country, the Public-Safety Answering Point
(PSAP) is the local police department.  As a former long-term
public-safety dispatcher, I can think of five possibilities for the
above scenerio:

1.  You reached the wrong default agency because you were calling from
a boundry.  The accident was in City 1 and you crossed a jurisdictional 
line into City 2 to use the payphone.

2.  You reached the wrong default agency because the 9-1-1 system is
new and when a PSAP is not programmed for a particular phone you get
the PSAP for where the telco's central office is located.  Or, the
wrong PSAP is programmed due to a clerical error and your call arrives
in the wrong city.  The 9-1-1 operator is supposed to detect this and
arrange for a correction.

3.  You dialed from a cellular phone.  These are handled differently
 -- in some areas the agency with highway/freeway jursidiction answers.
In other areas you get the PSAP for the city/county in which the cell
is located.

4.  There was an ANI or ALI failure.  When this happens, the PSAP
where the central office is located answers.

5.  Your PSAP is handled by a separate agency.  I've heard of this,
but it's extremely rare and the reasons for it range from political
problems between public-safety agencies to political pork spending.

Not to change the subject, but the police probably took longer because 
there was traffic on Kinderkamack and they couldn't get from the Dunkin 
Donuts in Emerson to Oradell Avenue any quicker.  Only kidding!

As I was reading your post, my initial guess as to the intersection you 
were describing was Soldier Hill Road and Forest Ave.  My wife grew up on 
Soldier Hill Road, and her best friend still lives at the corner house at 
Soldier Hill and Forest.

Of course this has nothing to do with why you posted.  If all that 911 in 
Bergen County is going to do is transfer the call to a local police 
station, then maybe all they should ask for is what town you are in.  If 
the caller is not from the area and doesn't know, then the 911 operator 
can ask more questions.

Unfortunately if they did it as they did in our town when it went to
911 (about fifteen years? now) you'll have the same wait (possibly).

If two calls come in (let's assume two different emergencies) with one
on the 7D number and the other on the 911 the dispatcher (and in small
towns usually only ONE) will answer the 911 line FIRST letting the 7D
police line just ring.

About eight or ten years ago we had a fire in my parents home (small,
thank God :-) and I had the 7D number burned in my head since
childhood. I called the number and on the fourth ring I picked up the
other line and dialed 911. 911 answered on the second ring while the
other call was STILL ringing ... she answered the other call after the
911, but I dropped the phone and was heading for the door at that
time... :-)

There could be a programming problem, or the number you were dialing 
could have been within the same LATA which may not have allowed using
anything but the Local Carrier. I know in California you can use anyone 
you want, but some areas still don't have equal access.

      A couple of years ago I was calling from a coin telephone in
either the Hearne or Bryan-College Station, Texas, market area (like a
LATA, only GTE).  I got in an argument with the GTE operator about
using (or not using) AT&T.

      She informed that AT&T had contracted with GTE in this area to
provide operator service for them and that she *was* the AT&T operator
as well as the GTE operator.

      GTE, of course, is not forbidden by the MFJ to do this, as an
RBOC would be.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Except I believe GTE signed off on that

was going to come after them next if they did not. I think they are
bound by much the same terms as AT&T is now. Also, while it is true that
the 'GTE operator is also the AT&T operator' in cases such as you have
described, the local Bells also have this don't they?  It seems to me
at one of the major centers here in the Chicago area the operators answer
for both Ameritech as well as AT&T. Am I mistaken on that?    PAT]

GTE does this in the Northern California too.  I was a bit confused by
it the first time I used a GTE payphone, because it was clearly
labeled that long distance calls are handled by AT&T.  I dialed "00"
and sure enough, the operator answered "GTE How may I help you?"  I
told her I was trying to reach an AT&T operator, and she said that she
*was* an AT&T operator, and that they handled GTE calls on behalf of
GTE.

I have looked thru the Telecom Archives from time to time, looking at
back issues of TELECOM Digest and many of the other files, and have
seen various articles regarding the original assignments of areacodes.
Most of us know by now that N0X codes were identified with states/provinces 
with ONE areacode and if a state needed MORE than one areacode, it was
assigned codes from the N1X set. Bud Couch's (bud@kentrox.com) recent
TD submission mentioned that codes with shorter dial spins were
assigned to regions where a larger volume of incomming calls were
anticipated -- i.e. Metro areas. (I don't know why 413 for Philadelphia
area was noted in his submission -- probably a type. 215 has always been
southeast Pennsylvania and 413 has always been western Mass.)

A few months ago, I faxed Carl Moore with many notes, lists, maps that
I'd compiled over the years of research from back issues of Bell's
journals, regarding areacodes, long-distance dialing, etc. so that he
could fill in the gaps, particularly those gaps from the late 1940's
and thru-out the 1950's (and even early 1960's). Carl lists the
original 1947 assignments alphabetically by state and then provinces.
I have put the codes in a NUMERICAL chart/grid showing how the shorter
dial pulls/pulses were assinged to dense areas and longer ones
assigned to remote states/regions.

Please note that the lower right-hand portion of the N0X chart is
blank in 1947. Also note that a smaller part of the lower right-hand
part of the N1X chart is also blank, and also notice that there is a
blank diagonal in the N1X chart. Since N1X states/provinces (those
with two or more areacodes) were states with larger metro areas, they
probably anticipated that they would split first. The shorter N1X
codes were assigned to the metro area and the longer N1X codes
assigned to rural/remote parts of a state with multiple codes. My
charts only identify the two-letter code for the state (or province)
and not the city or regions within a state, but they still are
more-or-less the same today, if one needs more detail. The diagonal
was probably reserved if when a metro area split, the inner area (or
more dense area) could keep their original code, and the suburbs --
outer area -- less dense area could get a code from the diagonal, rather
than a longer pulse code from the lower righthand part of the chart.


If one looks thru the actual year by year assignments in Carl Moore's
files at the ftp archive site, you'll see that the first codesp
assigned after 1947 were indeed from that diagonal: 219, 318
(*temporarily* for San Francisco, 1951), 417, 516, 714. Bell
more-or-less abandoned this pattern by 1953, as well as the rigid
meanings of N0X vs. N1X.  Also please note that N09 codes weren't
assigned until around 1957, some 10 years AFTER the areacode format
was finalized in 1947. BTW, I saw in a 1953 (GTE) Automatic Electric
publication similar to AT&T's Notes on Nationwide Dialing that there
were 128 possible NPA codes- i.e. the N09's, N10's, N00's and N11's
were not included. And most of us know that the N11's have never
intended to be NPA codes since they had been in use since the 1920's
(in mostly Panel and Crossbar localities) for local service codes. The
N00's were reserved from assignment until the mid-60's when 800 was
used for toll-free.  The N10's (another long dial pull series) was
originally used for TWX beginning in the early 1960's.

Subject: Fonorola Network Plans
Organization: Gateway: The Super Continental - North York, Canada 


[from Bell News, 4 Sept 95 - Bell Canada's version of events]

Fonorola to build tri-city network

Montreal-based Fonorola Inc., a long distance reseller, plans to get
into the carrier business.

It has just placed a $9 million order with Nortel for its OC-48 SONET
transmission equipment that will carry voice, video and data traffic
along the busy Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto loop.

Despite its ambitious growth plans, industry analysts look upon
Fonorola with a jaundiced eye. It has recorded multimillion dollars
losses since it set up shop in 1993, with the money-losing trend
still holding sway. Last year, its president left the company after
only eight months on the job.

France is expected to modify its numbering plan to introduce a new
area code system (fall 1996 was the planned date, I recall).

The 1995 Paris phone books as available in Toronto libraries don't
seem to mention this yet. Is there a conversion table or area code
boundary map available to indicate which places will get what area
code (other than the existing Paris area, to become 01 area)?

The main idea behind 9-1-1 as the nations emergency number is so
people don't have to know the local emergency numbers if they need to
call for assistance.  In this situation, had you not been from the
area and known the emergency number, you would have had to probably
call the operator who would have had to determine where you were
calling from and then transfer you to the appropriate agency.  Very
rarely will you get an operator located in the same community from
which you are calling (most often they are in another city or state)
so they normally will not have any idea what streets are where or what
have you.  This process of determining your location will add
considerable time to the response.

The 9-1-1 system you reached transfers calls to the police department
in question either because the police department does not want the
9-1-1 center to direct dispatch them, or because the 9-1-1 system does
not provide any dispatch services.  A direct dispatch 9-1-1 system
(like the one where I work) is certainly the most efficient way to go.
We strive to have every call in and out of our center within 60
seconds.  This is from the time we answer the incoming 9-1-1 call till
an emergency unit is dispatched.  Obviously, there are times when this
can not occur (excessive work load (like during storms, etc.),
shortage of emergency responders, non-emergency calls, etc.) but we
strive to achieve the 60 second mark on every call.

We in the 9-1-1 community are really our own worst enemy.  We drill
the 9-1-1 number into the heads of citizens as the only number they
need to know to get help.  Then when someone calls (like in this case)
and the response is slow or an error occurs, the 9-1-1 system failed.
The 9-1-1 number is nothing more than a telephone number with some
fancy caller ID built in.  The basic emergency response system has not
changed substantially because of 9-1-1 telephone number.  An
additional problem occurs when people call the 9-1-1 number for every
kind of assistance they need.  We get hundreds of 9-1-1 calls per day
which are for things like stopped up toilets, barking dogs, loud
music, etc.  These calls clog up the 9-1-1 lines and tie up the 9-1-1
operators.  We are to blame for this though, in most cases we do not
take the time to educate the citizens that 9-1-1 is for life
threatening emergencies *ONLY*.

> Think I'll dial up the 7D police number when another situation occurs.

In this situation, I don't know if the 30 seconds impacted the
response substantially, but it is certainly faster than an operator
could have located the correct 7-digit number and transfered you.  I
would still recommend calling 9-1-1 because in Enhanced 9-1-1 systems
the operator will know where you are calling from (except cellular....
for now) and this information alone can substantially speed up the
emergency response.

Just my .02 worth!

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Something I have never been able to under-
stand in Chicago is the apparent contradiction in instructions given on
the one hand by 911 supervisors (themselves police officers) and the 
instructions given at the local police station level. On the one hand we
are told that 911 is for *emergency use only* when immediate intervention
by police/fire/paramedic people is required; ie. my house in on fire now
or I am having a heart attack now or someone has invaded my home and is
standing here with a gun pointed at me now. We are not to use 911 for
trivial matters. That makes good sense!  But on the other hand, when we
attempt to discuss trivial (by comparison) matters with the police at
the local district police station on their direct phone, we are told we
must call 911 to get a police officer to come out. 

Now no matter how you look at it, if you come home from work and find 
your home was burglarized while you were gone, or your car stolen sometime
in the past day or so, that is *not* an emergency. It is certainly an
important matter, but it is *not* a life-or-death situation which requires
*immediate* police intervention. Our phone books tell us to use 911 only
for emergencies. The local police stations in Chicago on the other hand
tell us to use 911 for everything.  Who is correct on this?

It is probably just more of business as usual in Chicago, since here in
our village of Skokie on the other hand, both 911 and 708-982-2800 get
the village police. The same police officers will come out after a call
to either number, but they tend to come with sirens blaring and lights
flashing on 911 calls while driving more slowly and taking a bit longer
to arrive on calls to the other number. Do you think you people who are
in charge of 911 could clarify this once and for all?  Should people in
Chicago really be calling 911 when their cat gets stuck in a tree and
they want the Fire Department to send someone with a ladder?  Maybe part
of the reason 911 takes so long to answer at times -- although in any
dire emergency, a few seconds seems like an eternity -- is because of
all the foolishness they have to deal with.    PAT]

I wouldn't think so.  The carrier is not blocking the call by creating
an otherwise illegally formed number.  The subscriber who wishes to
use digital entrance facilities happens to also own the phone line
attached to the LEC onto which they've put either a recording or a
busy.

Most probably, yes.

See first paragraph. :-) Also consider virtual private networks like
area code 710, access code 762 (aka SDN = Software Designed Network),
the FTS-2000 system, GE's Dialcomm system, and so on.  Only authorized
users of those networks can gain (or should gain) access in the first
place.

There are some systems in TX that arranged for delivery of calls over
the three major long distance networks (AT&T, MCI, Sprint) via
dedicated circuits (T-1 or faster) to avoid the LEC access charges,
and the oddball connections come in over LEC lines.

Sorry Mark, somehow "0" got changed to 302 when I posted to this

phones (in his case, a Nokia model).

I don't believe John mentioned the make of his integrated modem -- or
whether it contains some form of cellular EDAC protocol (i.e., MNP or
ETC).  First, $100 for a cellular interface cable is a competitive
price.  Even if you could kludge one, it probably wouldn't be worth
the trouble.  Chances are, you couldn't do it since the connector on
the Nokia phone is proprietary.  The connection on the modem, may be
as well.

If your modem is an AT&T KIT modem, you can order the interface cable
from Nokia or AT&T.

If you would like further support, you may post to me directly and
I'll be glad to lend a hand.  I'm highly experienced at cellular data

It seems that with all the stuff going back and forth between ATT/MCI/Sprint 
and who knows who else, discount rate plans change constantly.  The
Universal Card is in my experience a charge card first and a calling
card second and I've continued to use the ATT Calling card for
simplicity.  This of course does not mean that the discounts plans
stay the same.  Recently the "savings" plan I was on was discontinued and
automatically changed to another "new" one.  I was actually surprised
that the discont rate did affect my monthy bill in a positive manner.

Check out the AT&T WEB page, http://www/att.com. I think they list all that 
stuff there.

Robert:

My company just installed an opt 11 about one year ago.  1/2 my bill
is international. My total bill was running 6k/mo. Before we got our
new system, we had a TIE CX with a Newbridge channel bank hooked to
Sprint.  The channel bank goes from T1 to 24 COTs. I got a great quote
from LDDS(World Com) that blew Sprint, MCI and ATT away. I was able to
drop my T-Span and go to switched service with LDDS and cut my monthly
bills by almost 1/2. I have not had one problem with LDDS international 
service. The switched service allowed me to lower the trunk count
going into my switch because I could receive local calls in and place
calls out on the same trunk.  The dedicated T1 service required me to
have dedicated outbound trunks.

One problem I did have when I stopped dedicated service was that the
line quality was poor and the CO copper lines.  I did end up buying a
T1 card for my opt 11 and ordering a Digital Entrance Fac. service
from Pac Bell.  Pac Bell provided this service at no cost.

If you are interested I have a used Newbridge channel bank for sale.

A while back (but sometime this year, I think) someone posted about a
cellular carrier that would take registrations via fax/mail with
credit card payment. The idea was that this carrier would activiate
your phone, and then you could roam legitimately in any market.

The per minute rate was quite high, but there were minimal monthly
fees. This service was intended primarily for 2nd or 3rd phones 
used only in true times of need and not for casual use.

I've searched the archives (mine and the "official" ones) and cannot

My local phone company is changing their system so that I must dial an

the carrier of my choice.  I called AT&T and US Sprint and they have
already converted to this method.  My phone company told me it was to
"improve my service" and was "a benefit me," but one compnay revealed
the real reason is to make it harder for AOS-slime to get calls.  Many
people forget to enter 10-xxx and the call will go through on the AOS,
but the 800 number MUST be dialed to use the new cards.

I'm for avoiding AOS-slime, but I do not consider this a service to me
 -- I always used 10-xxx and now I have to remember and dial a much
longer number to make calls.  This is not progress.  Is there any LD
company around that still allows 10-xxx access?

CB vigilantes locate him, go into his house and use a hammer to smash
his radio into a million pieces while the kid, horrified, watches. The

Subject: LEC v. AT&T (was Dial 10288 for ATT- NOT!)
Date: 14 Sep 1995 18:38:46 GMT
Organization: Tulane University


While I really haven't had many postdivestiture experiences with
independent (non-Bell) Telcos, I would like to share the following:

Before Bell South Mobility changed their New Orleans Mobile Telephone
Switch to a digital one a few weeks ago, when I'd dial- excuse me-
ENTER 00-Send, I'd *still* get a South Central Bell operator. (I now
go directly to an AT&T Opr).  If I'd tell the LEC Opr. that I entered
00 from my cellular and wanted AT&T (which is also my primary IXC from
my Cellular account), I'd be quizzed as to *where* I was calling. I'd
ALWAYS say out-of-state, and then be connected. The same quizzing by
the Bell Oprs. occurrs if a single-0 call comes in from a POTS/wireline 
phone and one request connection to an AT&T Operator. 

I think that Bell (here) can also pass you on to MCI, Sprint, etc.
AT&T and Bell South Mobility suggested that I enter 10-288-0(0)-Send.
That worked when 00 didn't as it still does now. I can NOT use
10-XXX+1/0+ten-digits-Send from my cellular, however. *Other*
10-XXX-0(0)-send does work to get other LD oprs (MCI, Sprint, etc),
since AT&T *is* my primary. The future format 101-XXXX does NOT
presently work from Bell South Mobility. (Current 10-XXX codes are in
the process of migrating to 101-0XXX, with NEW codes being assigned by
Bellcore as 101-5XXX and 101-6XXX. Eventually present 10-XXX codes
won't exist and one will have to use the 101-XXXX formats. Most
wireline telco switches in New Orleans -- and from what I understand
elsewhere DO allow 101-0XXX and some newer 101-5XXX and 101-6XXX codes).

When SCBell started 'Operator Take Back' here in 1986 with their
Northern Telecom TOPS equipment, Bell's payphones did NOT allow you to
dial 00. AT&T was the primary carrier for ALL Bell payphones for 1+/0+
InTER LATA calls, however, but 00 got you a 'call cannot be completed
as dialed' from Bell payphones in 1AESS offices. We still had two
remaining #5XB offices at that time, but I don't remember what 00 did
from coin and regular lines there. From Equal Access (1AESS) offices,
you COULD dial 10-288-0(#) from Bell's payphones and get an AT&T
Operator. Since 10-XXX-0 must wait for a timeout (i.e. 10-XXX-0+
calls, 10-XXX-01/011+ Intl,) I usually used 10-XXX-00 from phones
where I didn't know who the primary carrier was. But 10-XXX-00 also
got blocked at Bell payphones in 1AESS offices at that time, so I did
10-XXX-0#.

Prior to about 1989, AT&T Operators would handle inTRA-LATA calls at
SCBell's rates, and the charges would appear on the SCBell part of the
bill. The *other* carriers, however, would route inTRA-LATA calls at
OCC (cheaper) rates, if you reached them on 950-XXXX or 1-800 numbers.
Only *one* LATA in Louisiana allowed the use of 10-XXX+1/0+inTRA-LATA,
and only for one specific *other* carrier. If I dialed 10-XXX(even
288)+1/0+NNX-XXXX, and the number was in my New Orleans LATA, I'd get
'It is not necessary to dial a LD company access code for the number
you've dialed; Please hang up and redial withOUT the LD company access
code', meaning the call would route thru Bell, at Bell's higher rates!

Sometime around 1989 when location owners who had Telco's payphones
could choose the 0+ inTER LATA carrier, AT&T operators began to REFUSE
to assist on any InTRA LATA call, unless it was an 'emergency
situation'. If my 0+ calling card call was an AT&T (inTER-LATA) call,
I could only make 'sequence' calls to inTER LATA points. AT&T's TSPS
system knew my LATA by my NPA-NXX originating phone, and matched it up
with sequence call NPA-NXX codes. Pressing the # after the first (and
subsequent) calls hung up (or were busy/no-answer) gave the recording
"You may dial another AT&T HANDLED call now". Entering an Intra-LATA
NPA-NXX would give you "You may ONLY dial another AT&T ...".

We went OSPS sometime around 1990. AT&T could handle InTRA-LATA
sequence calls, but still at Bell's rates/revenue. Live/Human AT&T
operators still wouldn't casually put thru assistance on InTRA-LATA
calls. In 1991, the Louisiana PSC began to allow 10-XXX competition in
ALL of Louisiana LATA's, for any carrier that was regulated by the
La.PSC. (The Bell network just unblocked all 10-XXX carriers for
InTRA-LATA access, if that carrier had origination access from that
switch. Many carriers have been completing instate InTER-LATA calls by
all forms of access for 10+ years, and have NEVER had a nod-of-approval 

 from the La.PSC. AT&T filed its OWN InTRA-LATA tarriff structure for
Louisiana, and their rates are LESS than SCBell's (except for AT&T
handled calls within the traditional Local calling area- i.e. 0+ calls
from payphones, etc. SCBell is 88cents FLAT, AT&T charges by the
minute).

Lower Lafourche Parish (county) is served by LATELCO (Lafourche
Tel.Co.), an independent which homes on Bell (and probably has direct
homing on major LD carriers, too). LATELCO also has a TOPS operator
facility and a Tandem switch of its own (or did a few years ago). They
are NOT their own LATA, but are part of the New Orleans LATA. They
*will* connect you to AT&T when requested, but just like SCBell, quiz
you as to *where* you want to call. They wouldn't connect me to an
SCBell Opr, when requested but LATELCO and SCBell are 'one-in-the-same' 
as far as InLATA rates are concerned.

The East bank of upper St.John's Parish (Reserve, LA & Garyville, LA)
is served by the Reserve Tel.Co. They are part of the New Orleans
LATA, but do NO toll or tandem functions on their own. They also
haven't done any operator services on their own since probably the
manual days or at least since 1972 when New Orleans got a TSPS. When I
dialed 0 from a phone (Reserve Telco owned payphone -- Northern Telecom
equipment), I would frequently get an operator answering something
like:

"South Cen/... excuse me, Reserve Telephone Operator"

So I'd say "Well what are you -- South Central Bell? or Reserve Telco?

In this case, they WERE South Central Bell's Operators, but acting on
behalf of the Reserve Telephone Company. They were answering as
Reserve Telco in 1989, but in '91, they answered simply South Central
Bell.

Most of the east bank of Ascension Parish (EATEL East Ascension
Telephone Co) is part of the Baton Rouge LATA, and while they might
have a tandem, they don't have their own operator facilities. Their
telco payphones are GTE Automatic Electric equipment. Again, in 1989
dialing 0 would usually be answered:

"South Central Bbb ... ummm ... East Ascension Operator"

Again, by 1991 they too answered simply South Central Bell.

Back in 1988 thru 1992 time period, I'd frequently have problems
gaining access to 950- and 10-XXX+ from phones in independent telco
territory. Even without equal access, I SHOULD have been able to get
950-XXXX, maybe prefixing a 1 or 0 in front of it. Even that didn't
always work! BUT the multi-carrier environment 800 worked okay (even
back in the 80's and early 90's when 800-NXX codes identified a
carrier or function), including the 800 numbers to get a carrier's
'dialtone' (such as 800-CALL-ATT or 800-3210-ATT).

For those dialing 10-288-0(+) from GTE territory, maybe using AT&T's
800 access numbers might bypass you from the GTE facilities and route
you directly to the AT&T OSPS centers. AT&T and GTE/ other major
indep's might still have contracts in force for 'joint' or 'shared'
facilities.

And, in some areas, GTE (or another major indep) *is* a LATA, but most
independent areas are actually part of the larger Bell (or a different, 
but larger independent) LATA.

One OTHER interesting point here: When I dial (10(10)288) + 1 + NPA-555-1212, 
many times before getting the 'What City' I get either a 'AT&T's
directory link can complete your call automatically for an additional-
(whatever)- To accept Press x to reject press y' (I usually ignore and
time out to the 'reject').  Usually I get 'Directory Link' on
0 + NPA-555-1212, but sometimes I get it on 1 + NPA-555-1212. Other 
times on AT&T carried 1+ NPA-555-1212, I get 'Thank you for using AT&T'
before getting 'What City'. I know that Directory Assistance centers
are being centralized more and more -- even to voice automation as
we've read here in TD over the past few months. Some states' DA
provides a STATEWIDE residential name directory availability -- I
remember last year asking an Arkansas (501) directory oper. for a
number and she said that there was no one with a listing *anywhere in
the STATE* by that name. Of course, Arkansas is more rural. But even
if they cannot easily look up a single statewide database, the DA
operator you connect to could be several states away from the listing
she/he is looking up for you.

AND, AT&T is even getting into the providing DA operators. If I dial
(10(10)288)-NPA-555-1212 for a Bell Atlantic NPA, I found out that I
am usually NOT getting a Bell Atlantic employed DA operator, but
rather an AT&T listings operator. I don't know whether AT&T has its
OWN copy of a listings database, or if they buy realtime 'lookup' to
the LEC (RBOC) listings databases.

Pat-

If you read Steve Case's note to the America Online Community dated
September 13, 1995, you will see that he states:

"When material is forwarded to us which we believe is illegal, we
notify law enforcement and upon receipt of a court order or subpoena,
we cooperate fully."

Note that they will only do this when they receive a *legal* demand
for the information. I am not an AOL employeee, but have been a member
since shortly after its inception and know that this has always been
their policy and their operational behavior.

In other words, the "snooping" that is being done at AOL is because
they have been ordered to do so. In addition, as a corporate citizen
of the US, it is AOL's duty to help law enforcement apprehend people
who are in violation of the law.

One more thing that I'd like to add. America Online is a service that
is owned and operated by a private sector company. Their hardware,
software and service is owned completely by them. They are not a
public or quasi-public corporation nor are they a common carrier. They
have every right to read all e-mail, instant messages, postings, chat
room conversations and other data that resides on their systems. They
choose *not* to do this unless they find out that there is a possible
violation of the law.

You have every right to cancel your account, but when you agree to
their Terms of Service agreement when you subscribed, you also agree
to abide by their code of conduct and the consequences of violating
those codes.


Sincerely,

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I appreciate your early response to the
message which ran here just two issues ago on Thursday afternoon. It
is quite admirable that you wish to defend them. I don't think anyone
disputes that they are entitled to run their system however they see
fit, the same way Prodigy can run theirs as they see it, and for that
matter, Compuserve. It is their property to do with as they wish. I do
not think however, that most users there are/were aware that AOL gets
into their email and monitors their private chats. I do not think most
users there are/were aware that AOL was making up these little lists
of people they 'suspected' and turning them over to the FBI. 

The 'Terms of Service' thing there is a joke. Depending on the mood and
general disposition of the 'Guide' -- many of whom seem to very much
enjoy playing like little gestapo police, you'll see that ever-present
macro about 'Violation! Read Your Terms of Service' message time and
again in the public chat areas. Unlike the [HELPER] people on Compuserve
who seem genuinely interested in helping new users learn about the system,
the AOL Guides seem far more interested in meeting some quota for the
number of people to be written up for one reason or another. And yes,
of course, that's their perfect right. They own the system, they have
people of their own mindset who congregate there and seek out positions
on the system as Guides, and they are all free to do their own thing just 
as you point out. If you don't like it, then leave; lots of users have.

There is such a thing as 'taking a big stick and stirring the pot to
see what will come up' also. By this I mean that yes, as you point out,
a 'good citizen' will cooperate with authorities, and if something comes
up right under his nose, the 'good citizen' will inform the authorities.
You point out that AOL is only responding to *legal demands* i.e. subpoenas
made for files on their network, but it just seems to me they are going
a bit beyond the call of duty as 'good citizens'. It seems to me they
are being a bit too snoopy, and a bit too inviting of the authorities.
It is like "we know that you, as the government cannot tap into the email
and files and stuff without legal authority that stems from probable
cause, and we know that is hard for you to obtain, so suppose we do it
on this end and make your job a lot easier for you."

And although Steve Case may claim that they only respond to things which
are brought to them by other (presumably offended) users, I will suggest
that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the 'offended user' was one
of the Guides and not one of the regular subscribers. I will also suggest
that there is a certain amount of entrapment, with some of those people
arrested yesterday guilty of nothing more than viewing a piece of mail
which was sent to them without their request. That's like saying that
a plainclothes police officer cannot proposition a prostitute, lie about
his position, and then arrest her when she agrees to his offer. He can,
but its a sleazy, dispicable tactic.  I'd not be surprised at all as
these latest arrests work their way through 'the system' to hear at
a least a few defenses of the form that unwanted mail found its way to
them; that users heretofore unknown to them lured them into a chat room,
etc.   

How come Compuserve -- around three times as long, and just as large if
not larger -- never seems to have ruckuses like this?    PAT]

I came home one day and found an envelope from MCI to me with a
slightly misspelled name.  Since misspelling is quite a common
occurrence, I opened the mail and found a MCI calling card and a
flowery letter in Spanish telling "me" that I had joined the "Friend
and Family" plan of MCI.  Other than the "misspelled name", they have
my address and phone number right except that my NYNEX phone account
belong to my "correctly spelled name".

I used to work for AT&T and have had no problem with AT&T service. So,
I called MCI immediately and notified them I had never authorized them
to switch.  From MCI, I found out that an agent from Colorado had put
it the paperwork to switch "my-misspelled-self" with my address and
telephone number.

I am wondering is this an intentional fraud or some mistake?  Any of
you have any idea who would be responsible for checking, especially
with the misspelling between my NYNEX account and this fictitious MCI
account, plus the fact that an agent from Colorado enrolling someone
from Mass?

Can someone explain this bit to me, please? Surely, once a call is

That's what happens in the UK. You get an intercept message as soon as the
system knows you have dialled an invalid prefix.

Thus:

    01800        [intercept, because this is not a valid area code]
    01223 78     [intercept, because there are no 78XXXX numbers in Cambridge]
    74           [intercept, because there are no 74XXXX numbers in my area]

Check the fractional T1 Frame Relay and 56K Frame Relay costs in your
area vs. leased lines.  A T1 DSU will cost you more than a 56K DSU
typically, too.  If you need more info on this and WAN Access Service

Subject: Re: Pros and Cons About Making One Channel of T1 Data Line


There are only a things that you need to keep in mind.  If you are
using a channel bank for your T-1 you will need to remove a voice card
and insert a data card and do some rewiring on your 66 blocks. (If
you're not comfortable doing this call your vendor.) This will not
affect the quality of you current voice traffic.  If you're terminating
the T-1 to a DTI card in your PBX you will need to make sure that your
PBX can split out a channel of data.  If not you will need something
like a Larse Split-T sitting in front of your PBX on the network side.

Using your existing T-1 for data is a very good idea and very common.
Most carriers can give you better discounts on a data circuit when the
voice traffic is included.  Good luck and happy networking!

And of course, between my house and ISP, I can 99% of the time get a

US West has been using soft dialtone on some of its switches for about
a year now. When a line is set for soft dialtone, it can only call
"611" for the business office, and "911" for emergencies.

Interestingly, US West does not use "611" at all for lines which are not
set soft dialtone. Although you can dial "611" when you move into your
house to establish service, once they turn up the service, "611" no longer
works, and you have to dial an 800 number for customer service.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I think the reason for that choice of 
numbers might be that some people, on hearing dialtone, would be confused
and think perhaps the line was working normally. On attempting to make
calls and never getting connected anywhere, a logical response would be
to call 'repair service' which often times is 611.  By the way, what
kind of intercept *is* given out on other calls?  Do you receive a
'call cannot be completed as dialed' message, or a rapid re-order tone,
or some other message, tones, etc?    PAT]

Subject: Sync For CAP With Muliple IXCs
Date: Thu, 14 Sep 1995 11:43:17 GMT


I am engineering a hub site for a competitive access provider where
several interexchange carriers meet.  The network will have an OC-12
link into AT&T running 2-4 DS3 initially equipped with M13 on the CAP
end.  MCI and a number of other smaller carriers will have OC-3 links
to them.  The OC-3 links will carry DS1 traffic via byte synchronous
multiplexed DS1.  BTW, all SONET and M13 equipment is AT&T DDM-2000
and DDM-1000.

My question is how do we synchonize the CAP's network?  I assume that
network sync will be provided by all of the carriers, but I must
choose one -- most likely AT&T.  Then this sync source must somehow be
distributed on the fiber links to all the CAP's local customers.

The OC-12 and OC-3 links to all the IXCs will also need to be sync'd
together.  So do I take the sync signal off of the OC-12 from AT&T and
run it into sync input ports on the OC-3 running to the other IXCs?
Couldn't this possibly cause slips?

Where does a BITS clock fit into this scenario?

     I agree totally with Gilder's essay -- a few weeks of Yahooing and

I don't wish to attack Bill Gates, or rehash all the Mac vs PC debates, at
all.  But I think we should recognize that it really was the people at
Apple and their intellectual predecessors, who developed the Macintosh
gui, who truly "shifted the center of the sphere, (and) altered the axis
of (computing) technology". Gilder's grandmother is able to _click_ on a

it all so easily, because of Steve Jobs, or whomever, at Apple and Xerox

Think this is a bit simplistic. The Internet is the world's biggest
party line. Unless you encrypt your transmittals, a great many people
can read them. This is something that many of us have been aware of
for years.  (read RFC 1281 for some pointers).

Personally, I *expect* that lurkers read whatever is sent and take
precautions whenever sensitive matter is sent (ViaCrypt PGP - plug).
The fact is that E-mail is not like a sealed envelope, and though the
courts in this country have yet to decide (and there have been a
number of cases -- in each case I know of the "lurker" has been
acquitted.) I would not be surprised to find that E-mail is considered
to be the same as a postcard and with no expectation of privacy (might
also look at the DoJ suggested logo -- essentially says the above plus
reports of illegal behavior will be made to appropriate law enforcement.

So don't pull the plug on AOL unless you are prepared to pull the plug
on *every* provider.

First of all, AOL is bigger than Compuserve: something like 3.5 million 
users for AOL and two to three million for CIS.

Secondly, AOL has pitched its services directly to the mass market,
while CIS is sold largely to professional business users. (That is
probably about to change, for what it's worth.)

Thirdly, CIS's method of file exchange has long been on the hostile
side; if you're looking for simple ease-of-use, AOL is where you go.

All of this is by way of explaining why AOL seems to be having more
trouble with this stuff than CompuServe. It's an inevitable result of
adding eight million commercial on-line users to the net in a single year.

As for the rest of your rant -- AOL's power-tripping monitors, and the

implication. If you have a real problem, document it.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: How about this for documentation of
sorts ...  of over 100 doors kicked in on Wednesday by the FBI, a
grand total of *twelve* arrests. Now a point could be raised about
the incompetence in general of our Federal Bureau of Investigation
(certainly they have had long enough to catch Mister P.M. Unibomber
and lord knows they have been time and again pointed at him) and the
fact that 12 out of 100+ is only about ten percent of the names on
the list provided them by Steve Case. I wonder whatever happened to
the concept of probable cause?  Ten percent does not come close. 

By the way is it true that a group of those who were confronted by
the FBI -- then dismissed out of hand after the FBI had inspected
their computer and ransacked their houses, etc. have now consulted
with an attorney about a *class action* against AOL?  That's what
I am hearing over here, that they intend to file a lawsuit charging
false and malicious defamation of character, invasion of privacy
in their email, etc ... charging that AOL with callous disregard
for facts of any sort caused their arrest and albiet temporary detentions.

By the way, two of the arrested parties were here in the Chicago area.
Eric Zemke, age 31, 5200 West Agatite, Chicago, was released Thursday
on his recognizance (that is, his promise to appear in court as
ordered) and electronic home monitoring. An affidavit filed in 
U.S. District Court here by FBI agents stated that Zemke admitted
distributing child pornography via AOL, and agents further stated
that the same was located on his computer. Zemke, a computer consultant,
surrendered to the United States Marshall after learning that his
home had been searched in his absence. Zemke pleaded guilty in an
earlier 1986 case to child molestation. As a condition of his release
on bond pending trial, he has been ordered to have no contact with
children without another adult present, including his own three year
old child. 

Also charged was Craig Zucker, 5100 Winona Lane, Gurnee, Illinois.
Gurnee is a small town in the north suburbs of Chicago. Zucker was
not present at the search of his home, and his whereabouts remain
unknown. A federal warrant has been issued for his arrest. 

In affidavits filed, FBI agents said both Zemke and Zucker were tracked
down through telephone numbers used to connect them to the AOL network.
Undercover agents allegedly recieved ten electronic pictures from 
Zemke depicting young boys in various sexual activities. An AOL informant
turned over to the FBI three pictures involving young girls in porno-
graphic settings which the AOL informant claimed were sent by Zucker
in email. 
 
But only twelve out of a hundred?  Come on Steve Case, you should have
been more careful putting your list together. Now it looks like you
are going to get sued by a few of the people you defamed.    PAT]

They're only good citizens some of the time.  Ask any Usenet reader
how many chain letters and other forms of fraud come out of aol.com .
I hope that AOL is as vigilant in informing law enforcement officials
of this less headline-worthy type of crime as they are in going after
child pornography distributors and consumers.  Both are worthy of
investigation.

Now if they would only police their members that spam the Internet
with all this "LEGAL" "REALLY" chain letter. Of the 30 or so I
have seen in the last several month 23 of them have cpome from AOL and
all always have the same 20 names on them. I know that they are not

You're right Pat, you will get different instructions from different
people.  Like Skokie, we have a hunt group of "non-emergency" line
(217/333-8911) which rings into the same room and is answered by the
same people as the 9-1-1 lines.  At every public presentation and on
almost all of our handout material, we try to stress that this number
should be called for the non-life threatening emergencies.  These
non-emergency lines are typically answered as fast as the 9-1-1 lines
(when things are quiet).  But when things are busy you can see them
ring for 45 seconds or longer while the operators are all taking 9-1-1
calls.

Our main concern is that everyone's idea of an emergency is different.
To you and I, a fire and a heart attack are clearly life-threatening
emergencies.  To one of our neighbors though, a car parked blocking
the fire hydrant in front of their house may be a life-threatening
emergency.  I remember one night when I was still a dispatcher and I
got a call from a lady who had called a couple other numbers before
calling our non-emergency line.  She started off saying that she
didn't want to bother me by calling and asking if I was busy.  I
assured her she wasn't bothering me, nor was I busy.  She then started
to tell me about how she had been to the mall and then had to stop by
the grocery store to pick up a cake because it was her grandson's
birthday and she had just gotten home.  I asked her how I could help
her.  She said she was getting to that.  She continued that her
grandon was 8 and her daughter had moved away with her husband when he
got a good job with a software company in St. Louis and they had not
been back here for a visit in three years and this was the first
birthday party that she had hosted for her grandson in some time.  I
asked again what the problem was.  She said she didn't know if it was
an emergency or not, and she didn't want to **CALL** 9-1-1 and bother
those nice people... but when she came home she found her husband
laying on the floor of the kitchen and she didn't know what was wrong
with him.  ARRRRRGG!  Then, like I said in the previous message, we
get calls from people who's toilets are backing up on 9-1-1 lines, so
you see, everyone's idea of an emergency is different.

In short, every public safety official will probably tell you a
different method by which to report a crime or situtation.  It is
certainly up to each jurisdiction as to how they will handle calls and
who will answer them.  I have seen cops here on campus drive down the
street and when flagged down by a burglary victim or something they'll
just tell the citizen to go to a phone and call 9-1-1.  The problem is
one of public education for the citizens and public safety officials
alike.

One more story:

A very foreign speaking man calls on night (on 9-1-1) and we can just
barely understand what he is saying but he is pretty excited and keeps
saying something that sounds like "explosion".  We trace the line and
send police, fire and medical units screaming that way (not knowing
what was wrong and knowing how excited he was acting we didn't want to
take a chance on not having the right equipment there for whatever
they were to find).  Well, it turns out the one piece of equipment
they needed ... they didn't have ... a plunger.  It turns out this guy's
toilet was backing up into this bathtub.  To him an emergency,
certainly for any of us a stressful situation, but certainly, by no
stretch of the imagination a call for 9-1-1.

I sense that this is missing the point somewhat; the original poster's
complaint was that he couldn't get the police department he wanted
until the 9-1-1 operator who answered his phone figured out where he
was.  Imagine the problems if he _was_ from out of town and neither he
nor the operator knew exactly where he was.

On a side note, our Moderator comments:

I'm sure it varies from place to place; the thing to do would be to
call the non-emergency number for your community beforehand and simply
ask.  In the suburb of Arlington Heights, for example, if you want to
temporarily park on the street overnight for a few days, you must call
in your license plate and car description to the police ... by calling
9-1-1. Why? Because after hours, the only public service people at the
town hall are at the 9-1-1 emergency services console, where a three-ring-
binder for overnight parking info sits on the desk. It doesn't make much

the 9-1-1 system, that's the way we'll do it.

That reminds me of my experience when my car was stolen (in the
Oakland section of Pittsburgh).

I spent a good long period of time trying to find the right seven
digit number to call, because the phone directory only listed "911"
for police and finding the appropriate non-emergency number was not a
trivial task.  I think I had to look it up alphabetically in the Blue
Pages or something.

So I called that number and they referred me to another seven digit
number.  (Apparently I had reached some sort of administrative office
or something.)  So I dialed that SEVEN DIGIT NUMBER and imagine my
surprised when I hear, "911, please report your emergency."  What
ensued was a somewhat tense conversation, because I was understandably
confused as I stayed on the line and argued that I didn't call 911,
but a seven digit number.  (In retrospect I probably should have just
apologized and hung up.  Understandably the dispatcher was a bit curt
as she explained that I had dialed the seven digit number which
patched into the 911 system.)

Well, I think that with the shift of emphasis to 911, the organization
and promotion of seven-digit police numbers has become chaotic through
neglect. 911 is put on the front page whereas the seven-digit numbers
are relegated to alphabetical listings in the middle, with no indication 
which ones are for police dispatchers, which ones are administrative,
which ones are for which communities, and so forth.  The telephone
pinball I had to put up with in this experience was inexcusable, as
one number directed me to another and another, or maybe nobody answered 
or whatever.  Part of the fault lies with the police department then,
I think, for failing to provide a clearly defined and effective
alternative to 911 for non-emergency numbers.

Hence it may be no wonder that people are more inclined just to dial
"911" when they want the police for whatever reason.

I think the solution is to clearly identify emergency and non-emergency 
numbers, and under what circumstances they should be called, and then
make sure that the people who answer them can direct them correctly.

I had a similar situation to this. About ten years ago I lost my
wallet in downtown Seattle. When I got home I decided I should call
the police to report it missing. Well I dug up my phone book and
finally located the non emergency number and after being transfered
about a half dozen times ended up talking to the right person. They
then told me to call back and report if the wallet was found. Ok fine,
what number should I call to avoid the transfer mess I just went
through? "Just call 911."  This was at a time when there were news
reports about how busy the 911 system was and it shouldn't be used
except for emergency situations.

Child Pornography has no constitutional protection eg. if AOL was
found in knowing violation of the law they would NOT be protected by
constitutional rights of free speech.

Considering the existence of Guides and the existence of undercover
agents, AOL could not have claimed ignorance to the activities of
pornographers and as such was "under the gun" to come up with a list
of names for the FBI.

That is question begging.  A ruckus is somthing you hear about, for
all we know it may have already happened but Compuserve elected not to
tell anyone about it.

One possible legal method for explaining the press release:

AOL (nor any other online service that I know of, including my own,
GEnie) does not routinely monitor the contents of electronic mail.
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits this
practice on any system where some expectation of privacy is present,
in practice usually by private mailboxes being in a separate "area"
from the public bulletin boards.

There are circumstances where an online-service is permitted to
disclose the contents of electronic mail, and circumstances where they
are REQUIRED to disclose the contents: (in brief, since my copy of
ECPA is at home) --

  1.  If during the course of routine maintenance contents which are
clearly illegal are observed, they must be disclosed to the
appropriate authorities (usually with corporate counsel doing the
contact).  I =doubt= this is the proximate cause for the monitoring.

  2.  If during an investigation of a complaint about the contents of
email sent to one or more subscribers the illegal contents are found,
they must be disclosed.

  3.  If you are under a search warrant or subpoena to produce
information related to Such-and-Such activity, you must comply or face
contempt charges.

Obviously one would hope that warrants or subpoenas are obtained under
probable cause, such as a complaint made by one recipient, followed by
investigation of the complaint, followed by the determination that
other evidence can be obtained based on this file (such as a statement
within the body stating "keep on trading..."), followed by routine
monitoring as required and permitted under the law.

I don't think that the "highly unlikely" situation of "one of you"
revealing it to the AOL administrators is so unlikely.  Many are the
nights that I have popped onto a room and suddenly been deluged with
pictures or sounds for "trade" MERELY because I was in the room.
Yick!  

I'm not worried about continuing to use AOL myself.

or an undercover agent looking for some reason to bust someone.  And by the
way, since they have to, under the law, report illegal things they find in
the mail, I wonder how many times they have gone to the FBI with those

Reference is made to the TELECOM Digest Editor's article, "FBI Arrests
Dozens of America OnLine Users." Rarely have I seen more errors of fact in
something written to resemble a news article.

AOL does supply that information, but only in response to authorized search
warrants. Failure to do so would, itself, be a crime.

McGraw said no such thing, and AOL does not monitor e-mail or other
private communications themselves, a point that AOL (and McGraw) has
made repeatedly. They only become involved when a member of AOL
forwards e-mail or private communications to them with a complaint.
Otherwise, they do not concern themselves with the content of e-mail
or private communications.

This sounds terribly sinister ... until you realize that what is being
referred to here is an AOL release that tells members that pornography
and illegal activities are not permitted online, and that if they
receive messages dealing with such, they can forward their complaint
to AOL for action. The same thing happens on the internet, except that
there is no corporate entity to handle the intermediary role so
complainers simply forward the material directly to the FBI or other
law enforcement agencies.  And just as the FBI and others have people
surfing the internet looking for violations, they probably also have
accounts on AOL, Compuserve, and Prodigy doing the same thing. But
these are actions of the agencies involved and NOT of the corporate
entities owning the services.

Or, more truthfully, because they DON'T intercept anyone's mail, nor do
they monitor private conversations.

And it is apparent that you STILL don't know, since you've allowed
your overactive imagination to run away with you in ascribing to AOL
policies and actions that they do not have and do not take. No one at
AOL is snooping through your e-mail. How you jumped to that erroneous
conclusion is a mystery to me.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: You mention that 'AOL does supply that
information, but only in response to subpoena ... '.  May I ask *how*
the government becomes knowledgeable enough of any given user's email
to know to ask for the subpoena which AOL will then graciously honor?

Let's say a user becomes offended at some other user whose only 'offense'
is they happen to be gay -- like you for example. And that user happens 
to be very homophobic (not at all an unusual status on AOL), so he goes
to AOL and says 'I got a letter from this child molestor'. Now you know
and I know that 'gay' does NOT equal 'molestor'. But the homophobic user
still turns you in, maybe embellishes the story a little, etc. Now what
does AOL do at that point? Do they just go to their government contact
and say 'we have a new suspect, would you like to get a warrant for this
one so we can tap the mail'?  Or do they attempt any verification at
all of what some user complains about before going to the FBI?  If they
attempt any verification at all, how do they do this verification? Do
they get one of their own people to try and entice the suspect into 
further conversations/email?  

In other words, no matter which way they go on this, how can they help
but cause hassles?  If they pass the user's unverified complaint to the
FBI with an invitation to the FBI to supply the warrant (which is what
I suspect they do) then all sorts of innocent people get caught up in
this mess by and large because of the homophobic reactions of some users.
If on the other hand, AOL attempts to verify the complaint, how can they
do it without having to secretly monitor the user themselves for some
period of time?

It would be far better if AOL's posture was 'we are a common carrier with
no interest in the matter at all. If you have complaints about any given
user, then *you* take your complaints to the FBI. If/when the FBI then
comes to us with a warrant, we will respond. Until then, we respect the
privacy of our subscribers.'    

I'd think that you, as a gay person, would be very concerned about how
things pertaining to sex can get totally out of context as the result of
some homophobe. Haven't you seen it happen in the gay chat room there on
AOL?  Do you realize that out of the large number of raids which took 
place last week versus the tiny number of people actually arrested, that
quite a few of the ones hassled and raided and then released were gay and
had the misfortune of running into some homophobic person on line who said
'oh, there goes one of those child molestors' ... 

I can appreciate you wishing to stand up for and defend AOL. The service
has provided forums for gay people and done so in an open minded and fair
way. But when Steve Case decided to start making his list of alleged
child molestors, he blew it big time.  Maybe he listened to too many of
the homophobes there or too many of the teenagers with active imaginations.
Whatever ... a lot of the people who were scandalized last week and yet
completely innocent are not going to respond like the 1950's where folks
ran for cover hoping they would not be named again as 'communists'. This
time their response is going to be legal action against AOL, asking the
same goverment which visited them last week to now charge AOL with numerous
willful violations of EPCA. This in addition to legal action charging
defamation of character, etc.    PAT]

Earlier this year the NY Times published an article titled, "A Child's
Internet Sins Visited on the Parent."  The gist of the story is that
the subscriber's account was terminated because his 11-year-old
daughter was "guilty" of three TOS violations.  However, the parent
had never been informed of the *alleged* infractions and had no
opportunity to discuss the matter with his child or implement any
controls that he may have felt necessary.  To get reinstated, he
basically had to grovel.  The same situation befell one of his
colleagues, and I know at least two other parents (myself and a
friend) who were also cut off.
 
According to the article, AOL's Pam McGraw said "We're growing faster
than any other on-line service ... you're going to have some people who
violate the rules."  However, Compuserve's Daphne Kent said they have
expelled "probably less than ten people in the last couple of years."
Prodigy's Brian Ek said they have bounced "a handful over the years."
James Gleick, founder of The Pipeline, said he had bounced 1 of 10,000
subscribers, and that for repeatedly posting commercial messages.  He
also believes that using your real name, and not hiding behind screen
names, tends to discourage offensive or illegal behavior.
 
AOL would like to have its cake and eat it too.  Its role vis a vis
the law enforcement community is therefore suspect; they evidently
feel the end justifies the means.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Your final paragraph is where my feelings
lie. I don't support child porn and its purveyors. And people who read
my stuff long enough know I sometimes take a pretty narrow view of what
should be legitimatly private. It just seems like AOL has found a good
way to get the government to help them enforce their Terms of Service. 
It all just seems so cozy; as though they welcome undercover agents,
informers, snitches and spies to help them run things there. Someday it
would be nice to see Pam McGraw address the question of the 'rules'
where the constant barrage of junk mail which flows into Usenet from
AOL is concerned. Maybe Steve Case's next project can be to make a 
list of all the people who have committed mail fraud over there with
their chain letters, etc.  I logged in one day over there and had six
big humongous letters in my box over there (AOL mailbox) from users
who had cc'ed everyone they could think of -- hundreds of cc's on
each letter; screen after screen of cc names before you even got to
the letter itself -- with one of those 'this letter is sent to you for
good luck' things. You know, the one about the missionary in South 
America who started the chain going in 1947 and the letter has now

According to a recent  article in the {Miami Herald} (they  caught two
pedophiles from South Florida  -- one a  Scouts leader), the way  they
did it was  by having undercover  "wanna-be-pedophiles" get the  filth
directly from the later-to-be-defendants.  

This probably  *did* happen, but *after*  AOL monitored the pedophiles
email activities and targeted them  specifically (trapped them to send
email to the feds).

to erase it completely, you get a system notice saying 'oh there is no
need to do that, we now automatically delete mail after XX days, so
we have removed the delete function on email since you don't need it
any longer.'  So now you get something -- nice, nasty, chain letter,
enticement mail from an AOL Guide or whatever -- in your mail you don't
want you CANNOT get rid of it until XX days have passed and it gets
deleted automatically.

Maybe the backlog of unread 'suspected pedophile mail' was getting so
huge AOL did not have time to read it all before the users were deleting
it, so they had to prevent further mail deletion.   PAT]

Pat:

In regard to the discussion about FBI, AOL, reading e-mail, etc., I'd
like to add some hopefully relevant discussion.  I am taking no
position about the matter, nor am I being critical of either side. I
am addressing the situation as one of importance in the future of
networks and their services.

1.  The AOL spokesperson is quoted as saying that AOL would cooperate
with law enforcement if a search warrant or subpoena were served.  By
implication, this may have happened but the AOL releases that I have
seen do not explicitly state this fact.  So, very much to the point,
is whether due process has been carefully followed in this incident
[e.g., was there a reasonable cause to expect that a crime had been
committed vs. a fishing expedition], whether relevant law [e.g.,
Electronic Computer Privacy Act] was followed, etc.  Perhaps AOL can
be persuaded to be more forthcoming in just exactly what it did, and
what the sequence of its interactions with law enforcement were.  In
the interests of reassuring its customer base, it would seem that AOL
should be willing to say more.  And it should certainly be up front
about stating its policy to present and potential customers.

For example, did AOL or the FBI make the initial approach to the other?
How were the suspects identified at the very beginning?  Was the
complete daily e-message traffic of AOL scanned?  Did the FBI, through
its other resources, have a list of suspects about whom there was
reasonable cause to suspect that a crime had been committed and only
the traffic of these suspects examined?

Some possibilities are more socially palatable than others, so let's
get the facts.

2.  The allegation is that AOL "read" e-mail.  The statement is
ambiguous because the casual interpretation would be that some person
scanned it, but the volume could have been so large that some
automated process "looked at" the mail.  If the latter, the simple
approach would have been a filter that triggered on suspect words and
identified "hits" that matched.

As the government found out when it started its computer matching of
databases and as subsequent Federal law requires, hits must be
manually verified before passing them onward for action.  If an
automated process was used by AOL, was there some manual [i.e., human]
verification that presumably suspect messages were in fact
pornographically related or was there a blind forwarding of everything
that the filter found?

For example, suppose one had been discussing with a professional
colleague the sexual activity and habits of dinosaurs, a perfectly
respectable topic which was discussed in a TV show not long ago.  I
can imagine that a filter would flag some or all such message traffic
as suspect.  So the questions become, if an automated process were
used:

    o Was the selection process well done, well thought out, properly
implemented?  Or was it some quickie software job that simply looked
for individual word matches?

    o Were the hits manually verified before passing to law
enforcement?  Might perfectly innocent people have been called to the
attention of law enforcement for innocent activity?

Why raise such questions?  This event is among the first to involve
the interplay of network service providers and law enforcement.
Similar events are going to happen again and in various contexts,
espcially as the country creates its NII.  We ought to get the legal
obligations, the legal status, the policy of responding to law
enforcement, etc. of service providers straightened out now and stated
before the situation gets out of hand.  And we should make sure that
the means for law enforcement to acquire such information is
consistent with law, with constitutional protections, with appropriate
judicial oversights, with proper accountability, etc.

And last, but not least, let's straighten it out at the Federal level
so that state and local law enforcement actions will follow suit.

tures to the other and it is my belief Steve Case made the first
overture. I believe he realized that violations of ECPA would land
the corporation in very hot water; yet it was essential that they be
able to read mail, etc. I think they encouraged their Guides and a 
few other people to specifically 'watch for this kind of thing' and 
turn over *mail addressed to themselves which they had already read*
for further examination. That kept them in the clear initially.  PAT]

I'd imagine AOL covered their keisters with some legal "fine print"
included in the disclaimer clause of their sign-up. You know,
something like " ... use of this client software implies relinquishing
all rights of privacy ..."

OF COURSE they rolled over when sqeezed by the feds. AOL is a business
and only the very biggest of businesses can resist being squeezed (ie.
Microsoft).  A business exists to make money, and there's plenty of
money to be lost by protecting the rights of a tiny minority of their
clients rather than just spying on their clients and handing them
over. As they say in the mafia, "Nothing personal, it's just business."

The feds have chosen child pornography as The Issue to try to gain
control of the Internet in the USA. Our esteemed elected public
officials have discovered that the 'net is a powerful force of the
people. And politicians fear powerful forces that they don't control
(see the excellent article on this topic in the current issue of
{Internet World} magazine). I predict we'll be seeing more raids in the
months ahead as the feds go after other easily "painted" targets like
militias and encryption proponents. The Digital Telephony bill is now
law and will eventually give the feds fingertip access to every bit
travelling through US phone lines -- and the 'net is connected by -- you
guessed it -- phone lines. So they'll have the technology in place --
now they need the legal angle in place to broaden its use.

Enough ranting. Bottom line: those purveyors of smut were naive to
think a) nobody was listening, b) their service provider would protect
them. Idiots. But it does serve as a warning to the rest of us. "If
you don't want what you say to appear in tomorrow's local news, don't
say it on the Internet". And use PGP.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Where PGP and 'easily painted targets'
are concerned, look at how they are crucifying Phil Becker right now.
That's a shame, it really is. 

Something that has never been totally clear to me also is the connection
between America OnLine and their division called Chicago OnLine. COL is
very big with the {Chicago Tribune}. The Tribune distributes the AOL/COL
software via large newspaper ads that run every week, and everyone who
writes in the Tribune has an AOL/COL email address. You can read the
entire paper on line each day. I think the Tribune parent company may
have some ownership in America OnLine. COL has two or three of its own
chat rooms as well. A very structured environment, the COL 'host' for the
day (like a Guide, only in this case they call them 'Host') sets the
topic of discussion and all must adhere to it or leave the room. No
unmoderated conversation allowed in the COL chat rooms. I wish I knew
more about the relationship between the {Chicago Tribune} and AOL.    PAT]

For those people who weren't scared by PAT's original posting, here are a
few excerpts where all I did was change of few of the names to reflect an
earlier time in the history of the United States.

                    --------------------------

The FBI made dozens of arrests and searched 120 homes and personal
computers on Wednesday as part of an investigation into Communists on
America OnLine. 

United States Senator Joseph McCarthy spoke in support of the actions of
America OnLine and FBI agents, noting, "We are not going to permit
exciting new technology to be misused by the Red Threat."

She [AOL spokesperson] said they always provide the FBI with the names of
users suspected of involvement in communist activities.

Ms. McGraw also discussed an online 'neighborhood watch' program in effect
on AOL where users are encouraged to oberve each other's activities and
report on them to Committee on Un-American Activities.

Raids and arrests of other AOL subscribers 'suspected of being members of
the Communist Party will continue over the next few days until all the
user-suspects have been located.

As stated in the press reports here in DC, AOL's policy is thus:

They do not monitor private e-mail or chat rooms.  They do monitor public 
chat rooms.  When a user presents them with evidence that another user 
may be pariticipating in illegal activities, they pass that information 
on to law enforcement.  They cooperate with judicial orders (such as 
subpeonas) to monitor individual users.

Effectively, it works like this.  They're not going to monitor random 
user traffic (and they can't monitor it all, due to volume).  But, when a 
user sends them a message that came from another user with a potentially 
illegal file attached, they pass it on (since they would be on weak legal 
grounds to decide themselves what costitutes illegal pornography).  If, 
based on such evidence, a court orders that a user's mail be monitored, 
they comply (just as phone compaines do with wiretap orders.)  I see 
nothing nefarious in this, just responsible management for a large 
corporation.  Same thing with the "neighborhood watch" concept.  AOL has 
positioned itself as a "family-friendly" service.  They have the right to 
take whatever actions they feel are necesary to protect that 
environemnt.  And you have the right, if you don't like it, not to 
subscribe.  But do so based on facts, not an ASSUMPTION that they 
randomly monitor private e-mail.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: So a homophobic user says to the management
"I got paged by a child molestor" when what really happened was he got an
instant message asking if he was gay. **Still, an inappropriate question for
an instant message to a stranger, but it happens on AOL a lot**.  Now what
does management do with this complaint?  How do they act on it?

And it is funny you mention that 'AOL has positioned itself as a family-
friendly service' since no matter how you slice it, a lot of the chat
rooms are just plain filthy; hardly the sort of conversation that the
'American family' (as AOL would seem to define it, or certainly as our
illustrious congress would define it these days) would sit around having
in the evening.  PAT]

This is interesting.  I have an AOL account and I am continually
amazed at the amount of activity of a sexual nature on there.  There
are escorts soliciting men visiting larger towns, homosexuals
soliciting partners, and just ordinary straight people looking for
partners.  I am also amazed at some of the GIF pictures they allow
people to post.  I have personally received solicitations from all of
the above totally cold, no prompting at all on my part.  I could have
had a prostitute in a major city arrested had I wanted to.

My point is that they seem to cater to this crowd to a certain point.
AOL is making money off of sexual activity.  While no one supports
kiddie porn, I think this whole thing is a "cover their butts"
exercise designed to make them look wholesome and clean.  I think Pat
is probably correct in saying there will be a lawsuit.  Their method
of deciding who is dirty and who is not will never hold up in Court.
I am not surprised that the FBI is all over this, given the dreadful
failure of The War on Drugs.  They need some wins right now.  12
percent is not a good hit rate, though.  I would be interested to know
how THEY feel.  If the FBI could not find enough evidence (and they
generally don't need much) to make arrests, it must have been pretty
clear that nothing was wrong 88 percent of the time.  I am very
surprised the rate was that low.  They must not have done any of their
own research before pursuing this.

This will be around for a long time, I think.

The following is an abstract done of an article off the AP and in
today's {St. Pete Times}.  Some errors and assumptions may be mine.

A Caribbean resort asked a Chicago judge to force America Online
to reveal an 'anonymous' userid in order to prosecute her for libel.

  - 'Jenny TRR' posted to an AOL scuba diving bulletin board;
  - she claimed a bad experience with an instructor at a resort.

o the resort was notified by another AOL user who was often a guest;
  - their pursuit of the claim determined it was false;
  - since much of their business comes from online, they felt injured;
  - their post to the bulletin board calling for apology went unanswered.

o ED: the article doesn't say if AOL was asked for, and denied, the name.
  - the  resort filed a motion in Cook County (IL) Court;
  - so far, no response, and no calls <by AP?> to AOL were returned;

o technology experts fear an onflood of court cases.
  - are computer users responsible for what and where they say online?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: What's goofy about AOL is their total lack
of security. Screen names can be changed randomly; you can have up to five 
'screen names per account active at any given time; there is no real way for
other users to find out the absolute ID of mail they receive or chats they
are in, etc. 

Now on Compuserve, you can change handles at will in CB (unlike AOL where
you apparently have to log off entirely and log back in with a different
'screen name'), but at least the UID is always available if you wish to
turn on the display.  So I can be whatever name I want to be, and whatever
sex I want to be and whatever on Compuserve, but the sophisticated user
will do /who <jobnumber> or /pro <jobnumber> from time to time in the chat
to see the actual User ID (the 7xxxxx or 10xxxx number) of the person they
are chatting with. If you keep a little filebox of index cards near your
terminal as I do, or you keep files on your harddrive, then when approached
for a chat with 'Joe' you can look at your index cards under that UID and
note that last week 'Mary' with the same UID requested chat. So no matter
what the person wishes to say, there is an absolute identity to fall back
on, a lot like Caller-ID. I may not know who the person really is, but I
know where the chat or email came from.

On AOL, 'Joe10256' this week can be 'Joe65201' next week, or even five
minutes later if he logs out and changes screen names then comes right
back on line. "John Brown" today is "John A. Brown" tomorrow. There were
some users swept up in the raids last week who had nothing at all --
literally nothing -- to do with child porn. Their problem was their screen
name looked similar to another one. Kid goes crying to mommie that he
got a nasty message on line. Message scrolls off or gets erased somehow
before it is captured. Kid *thinks* it came from John Brown. Mother, in
her homophobic lust goes on line, finds a name that 'must be the one' and
gives it to AOL. AOL tells FBI, here is another one, etc ... one of the
raids last week wound up with someone whose account *had been hacked*. In
other words, it was not the account holder at all.  It was some company
with two or three AOL accounts. Granted they should have watched their
acocunts more closely. One of the accounts had been hacked and was being
used by someone. FBI goes to the real owner of account, he is astounded
to hear of any of this at all. 

Yeah, ten percent of the list is not a very good batting average, and I
suspect AOL and Steve Case are going to pay dearly before this is all
over and done with. I have not been on there in quite awhile myself but
a current subscriber said this whole discussion is being pretty well
squelched in discussions there. If it comes up in a chat room a Guide is
soon on hand to issue a TOS violation for 'disruptive behavior' for 
having the audacity to even bring the topic up. 

Remember how in the 'hacking' trial of Craig Neidorf in Missouri
things were going along with the government making their spiel and
all, based on what their 'good and reliable contacts' at Bell had told
them ... then someone pointed out that the 'thousands and millions of
dollars in 911 software' which had been ripped off from telco was actually
available for sale from Bellcore for a few dollars?   <grin> .... I think
we are seeing the same thing here. The FBI assumed AOL would be a good
and reliable source of information -- and I don't mean the {Chicago
Tribune} online -- and it turns out that the informant has axes of his
own to grind; but don't they all ... otherwise why would anyone filthy
their hands in this kind of stuff?  PAT]

Subject: The Day a City's Phones Died
Date: Tue, 19 Sep 1995 16:25:04 EDT
Organization: APK - Internet Provider for Ohio.


The phone system died Saturday morning September 16 in Cleveland Ohio.
This is a city with a metropolitan population of two million people.
Apparently a good portion of them were trying to use the phone to get
Cleveland Indians baseball playoff tickets at 8 AM that morning.
That's when tickets went on sale, and the phone was the only method
for reserving the tickets.

As of 9 AM that day I was unable to dial the exchanges that I wanted --
office, my wife's pager, and so on.  After receiving a dial tone as
usual without delay, I dialed a number, and got an immediate polarity-
reversing CPC "click" and then a dial tone. No intercept, nothing.
This went on for roughly four hours.

10222-1-216-nnn-nnnn did work to get through to numbers in my local area. 
However, other carrier access codes failed with "all circuits are busy." 
My cell phone was also able to get through.  These were expensive if
workable alternatives. 

Ameritech was clearly overloaded.  An article in the 9/17/95 {Cleveland
Plain Dealer} reports that Ameritech expected heavy volume, and that they
thought the problem would clear itself up, but it did not. The article
made mention of a few instances where doctors were unable to be paged or
call out, and it implied that there was no big problem.  I wonder how many
doctors and others who rely on the phone system would agree with that
statement. 

The article also mentioned that an ATT team was called in for emergency
help, since they sold Ameritech the switching equipment. The article also
said that more tickets for the second round of the playoffs (getting a
little ahead of ourselves, now, aren't we, fans?) would be sold via the
same calamitous method on 9/23/95.  Lastly, the article quoted a Cleveland
Indians official as being sorry for the inconvenience, and gee, doesn't
this show how popular the team really is, anyway? 

Three cheers for mob psychology, anarchy, and chaos (not).

In the "Series Preface," Smythe points out the dichotomy between
academic texts, with an abundance of theoretical detail, and expanded
technical manuals, with no foundational background.  There is a vast
gap between these two groups of the literature.  Smythe's aim is to
fill that gap and, at the same time, produce a work acceptable to the
two polar camps.  I submit that he has succeeded admirably, with a
work accurate enough to be used as a course text, and practical enough
to become a technical reference.  The text is clear, the examples and
illustrations taken from both proprietary and open systems, and the
material up to date.
 
The basics of network architecture and internetworking are covered in
the first two chapters, while the next two introduce protocols and the
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) structure for thinking about
communicating systems.  Chapters five to eight look at local area
networks, Ethernet, Token ring and proprietary systems.  The various
types of relays -- repeaters, bridges, and routers -- are discussed in
chapters nine to twelve.  Chapters thirteen to seventeen address the
more practical and holistic aspects of connecting different network
architectures, management design, and new developments.
 
While not sufficiently detailed as to be a programming guide, this is
an excellent introduction to the concepts and terminology, and a very
practical guide for design.

Subject: Need Help To Deal With "Slamming"
Date: Tue, 19 Sep 1995 22:21:47
Organization: Megaweb


A friend of mine in Mass was ripped off by some small long distance
company by illegal connection without consent.  That person has had
some deep discount package to call with MCI so he/she called abroad
alot unknowing that the line had been slammed to some other company.
That result to a very, very big LD bills with some outrageous charges.
That person called the sleazy company to complaint and asked for
record of consent to hook up.  The customer service gave some run
around then said they don't have any proof other than it might be
local telco's mistakes or might be some one in the family has given
the permission.  

My friend is not afluent in English, neither am I, that makes the
situation even tougher to deal with the fly-by-night company.  So far,
my friend has sent a letter to Nynex and FCC to complain.  My friend
also talked to MCI trying to figure out the right amount if they had
made the calls with them to determine the differences.  It was a big
one, surprise, surprise :-).  Of course, the line has been connected
back to the company of choice. What else could my friend do other than
refuse to pay the full amount?  Any pointers, feedbacks would be
greatly appreciated.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Tell him to pay only the amount he would
have been billed had MCI handled the calls. Tell him to write a check to
the company which slammed him for the amount he would have paid MCI and
to note on the check that it is 'payment in full'.    PAT]

Subject: Question About NPA Overlays
Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 261-4700 guest)
Date: Tue, 19 Sep 1995 03:37:03 GMT


I've been reading about the overlays of the Houston and Dallas (and
possibly Fort Worth) areas in Texas.  Houston has already been overlaid
with area code 281, Dallas will be overlaid with 972, and area code 817
(including Fort Worth, Waco, and Wichita Falls) is rumored to be planned
for an overlay.

One of the common threads I've seen in these overlay plans is "all new
numbers after XX/XX/XX will be in the new area code."

This raises a couple of obvious dumb questions:

* For how long?  Presumably at *some* point, discontinued numbers in the
original area code will be made available for service.

* What about little tiny towns that only use maybe 1/10 of 1 prefix?
Will they have an entire new prefix assigned just to adhere to the "all
new numbers after X" rule?  (It also seems quite silly for a town with
only one prefix to have ten-digit local calling, but some of that will
certainly happen if 817 overlays.)

On a tangent, speaking of little tiny towns in Texas with only one
prefix, my ancestral home town of Goliad has undergone some major
changes in the last year or two:

* they now have to dial SEVEN whole digits for local calls, instead of
only five digits (the first two always being 53, 52, or 58);

* their local calling area has expanded enormously, now including the
city of Victoria, 27 miles away;

* they finally have equal-access long distance!

* there is talk of getting a cell in Goliad, instead of having to rely
on the Beeville and Victoria cells for coverage.

The city of Goliad, located at the junction of US-59 and US-183/77A,
occupies the 512-645 prefix.  It's the second-oldest town in Texas.
There are a couple of other towns in Goliad County that are much
smaller, but have their own prefixes (Charco 512-269, Berclair
512-439, and Weesatche and Fannin, whose prefixes I couldn't find).

          DIGITAL ASSISTS FRENCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY
              TO BEGIN NATIONWIDE MOBILE PHONE SERVICE

MAYNARD, Mass. -- September 15, 1995 -- Digital EquipmentCorporation
today announced a three-year, multi-contract relationship with the
French PCS (Personal Communications System) operator Bouygues Telecom
to provide a sophisticated mobile phone service which includes a
customer care and billing system, telecom network management, and a
full range of solution and support services.

     Selected by the French government in October 1994 as France's DCS
1800 Mobile Operator, Bouygues Telecom has committed to have a
nationwide mobile phone system starting with full coverage of the
Paris area during the first half of 1996.

     Initial plans call for the rapid growth of subscribers.
     According to Yves Francois, director of information technology at
Bouygues Telecom, "We chose Digital because of their complete under-
standing of our business needs, and their superior telecommunications 
technology and solutions capability to manage a vast and complex
radiotelephone network from a single point."

     Jean-Claude Sainctavit, Digital's worldwide vice president for
the telecommunications industry, said that "Digital's industry-
leading Alpha technology, along with our clustering, solutions and
support capabilities will provide Bouygues Telecom with a lower cost
of operations and an almost immediate network problem solution
capability with scalable advanced technology."

     He added that "our partnership with co-contractor SEMA Group, the
use of our TeMip (Telecommunications Management Information Platform)
platform, and the experience gained from managing similar telecom
projects worldwide, most recently, for example, in Germany and
Malaysia, were the final determining factors in our selection by
Bouygues Telecom."

     Bouygues Telecom is a company controlled by Bouygues (a major
multi-trade group). Bouygues Telecom brings together the principal
operators of DCS 1800 networks in Europe, Cable & Wireless (United
Kingdom), Veba (Germany), and US West (United States), along with the
Jean-Claude Decaux Group, Banque Nationale de Paris, and

Compagnie Financiere de Parisbas.

     Bouygues officials noted that the technical performance, high-
capacity and attractive price of this new generation of easy-to-use 
mobile phones will meet the expectations of a wide public.

     Bouygues Telecom plans to gain a significant share of a market
estimated at more than 10 million customers over the next 10 years. 
The company will base its development on the quality of its customer 
service.

     The arrival of Bouygues Telecom as the third licensed mobile
operator in France is expected to further stimulate the development 
of mobile phones, and help France catch up with the other main 
European countries in this field. 

     Personal telephony is a major line of development for Bouygues 

- already present in the telecommunications sector since 1987 
(3RP Public Access Mobile Radio, ERMES paging network). 

     Digital Equipment Corporation is the world's leader in open
client/server solutions from personal computing to integrated
worldwide information systems. Digital's scalable Alpha platforms,
storage, networking, software and services, together with industry-
focused solutions from business partners, help organizations compete
and win in today's global marketplace.

Organization: Westmark, Inc.
Date: Tue, 18 Sep 1995 18:19:27 GMT


I did not call 911, because it was not an emergency.  I was, however,
in a hurry to catch a train when I walked past a vacant house in New
Jersey in mid-winter.  There was water running out of the side of the
house, and there was ice all over the wall and the driveway below.

I did call 411 (from a pocket cellular phone I usually carry).
"Welcome to Bell Atlantic" said James Earl Jones, followed by "What
city, please?" in a different voice.

"Long Hill Township, Police Department, non-emergency number, please"
I replied, while walking briskly toward the Stirling station on the
New Jersey Transit line.

"908-647-1800" was the reply (in a third voice).  I entered that
number and pressed SEND.  The train coasted to a stop and I boarded,
still waiting for the call to go through.  Eventually, ring-back.

"Long Hill Police, Sergent XXX" a voice said.

"I would like to report a burst water pipe in a vacant house," I
said.

"Where?" he asked.

"289 Main Avenue, Stirling," I replied.

"Where's that?" he asked!

"Next door to 285 Main Avenue." I replied, somewhat taken aback at
his question.

"But where is it?" the officer asked.

"On the East side of Main Avenue, between Essex and Union Streets,"
I told him.

"Oh," he said, "is that the house where the old man died?"

"I don't know if anyone died there, Sir, but the house has been vacant
since July." I explained.  The train was about to stop in Gillette.  I
had, by how, paid for several minutes of air time.  The conductor came
by my seat saying something about tickets.

"Round trip to Hoboken, please," I told the conductor, while pulling
out my wallet.  I thought I had covered the mouthpiece of the
pocket-phone, but...

"Hoboken?" said the officer on the phone.

"No, Stirling!" I told him.

"Where in Stirling?" the policeman asked.

I was beginning to wish I hadn't bothered.  I was, after all, only
trying to help a property-owner I didn't know, and perhaps save some
water.  I was glad it wasn't an emergency.  I gave him the address
again, and suggested that perhaps he could contact the water company
or the property-owner.  The phone now displayed almost 5:00 of
airtime, and I wanted to sit back and enjoy the trip to the Big Apple.

That afternoon, as I walked back to my office from the railroad
station, I saw a plumber's truck parked in front of 289 Main.  The
flow of water had stopped.  A roll of damaged carpet was on the
front porch ...

A Bell Atlantic truck was also parked in front of the house.  The
network interface device, previously on the outside wall of the
house, was now lying face-down in a pool of icewater on the ground.

Subject: Warning!  Directory Assistance Imposter!
Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 261-4700 guest)
Date: Tue, 19 Sep 1995 00:59:40 GMT


WARNING!  Directory Assistance may be giving you bad information! 
 
Usually, calls to 1-NPA-555-1212 (DA) get routed to an operator center
owned and operated by one of the "Baby Bells" and they use telco-compiled 
data to search for your request.  This data is updated daily and is
the most accurate information available.
 
However, there has been a change recently involving interlata calls to DA. 

If your default IEC is not AT&T, or you route your DA call over an IEC 
other that AT&T, your DA call may actually be routed to a third-party DA 
"boiler room" located in Missouri.  This company has been hired by MCI to 
provide DA service to MCI and others for increasing numbers of areas of 
the country. 
 
Our experience with this operation is dismal.  We routinely get quoted
the wrong telephone number or we get incorrect "not found" reports.
They must use the same obsolete and innaccurate data that MCI used on
their ill-fated CALL-INFO experiment.  Furthermore, operators there
tell us that the equipment they use is antiquated in that it lacks
sophisticated search engines which include phonetic sound-alikes and
street arguments -- features in use at Bell facilities for over ten
years. Subsequent calls to a "real" DA operator through AT&T circuits
substantiates this claim because we will then get the correct information.
 
It is fairly easy to tell if you're getting this slipshod operation.  
First, their standard greeting is a terse "City and name in your request." 
Second, their autoquote system simply hangs up on you instead of telling 
you that if you need more information, an operator will return.  The 
operators are dripping with underenthusiasm. In other words, it has MCI 
written all over it. 
 
One area of the country for which we regularly need DA service and this
is happening is Idaho.  Our call to US West's Director of Information 
Services in Denver confirmed that this practice is spreading, but is
limited to MCI and other IEC's who use MCI circuits for DA (like Wiltel). 
 
This is bad news because Wiltel's charge for DA is substantially less than 
AT&T.  But for an increasing number of areas, you will have to use AT&T to 
have any confidence in what you are told. 


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Hasn't that always been the case, that you
pay for quality and confidence in telephone service? What you are saying
is just another reason to stick with AT&T.   PAT]

Subject: Partial Re-Tendering of Indian Telecom Bids Likely


-==This Indian Techonomist bulletin (C) Copyright 1995 Rishab Aiyer Ghosh

September 19, 1995: India's telecom privatisation programme is the
biggest in the world, so confusion is not unexpected. The tenders for
nationwide basic telecom services, which attracted bids worth a total
of $82 billion, are now the main source of confusion. Two bidders,
HFCL and Reliance, managed to carve up 14 of the 20 regions available.
HFCL bid $27 billion for nine of the best; Reliance bid $15 million
for five poor regions. As the privatisation process was intended to
further competition, this is not acceptable.

In an exclusive interview to The Indian Techonomist today, Telecom
Secretary R K Takkar indicated that a partial re-tendering is likely.
He did insist that no decision on caps - limits on the number of
licences per company - will be taken until the return of the
Communications Minister later this week. But he was willing to discuss
the "hypothetical", but probable, case that caps would be imposed, or
that the highest bidder would renege on its commitments. He made it
clear that "if no one [else] matches the highest offer" - in case the
highest bidder itself opts out - then the government "has no option
but to re-tender."

HFCL, with a 1994-95 turnover of under $35 million, is widely
considered ready to back out of its bids - three times as much the
next highest bids - in some regions, even though the company denies
this loudly. In most cases, the other bidders are almost certainly not
going to match HFCL's bids. Retendering, at least for the regions that
pose problems, appears to be the only way out.

Speaking about the tenders for cellular services, opened on August
5th, Mr Takkar clarified that, contrary to what has been reported
elsewhere, the cap of two in profitable A circles is not yet decided.
The Minister for Communications, Sukh Ram, had made a statement about
this cap just before leaving the country for medical treatment three
weeks ago, and it has lead to much speculation. Mr Takkar said that
the government has prepared a study of the effects of these proposed
caps, about which an actual decision will be taken upon the Minister's
return.

Mr Takkar also said that the government was preparing legislation
making the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) a statutory
body. An amendment to create the body under government prerogative
powers was withdrawn last month following opposition in Parliament.
Mr Takkar said there would be no major problems with creating a
statutory TRAI immediately - either in the next session of Parliament,
or by executive order - rather than after a two-year trial period as
originally planned. There will still be scope for future modification
of the authority, including its merger with the proposed Indian
Broadcasting Authority.

Mr Takkar said that the government hopes to award contracts for
cellular services by the end of this month, although basic services
may take longer. He said that the government had made it clear to
Parliament that the setting-up of the TRAI and the granting of
licences were not connected, as the government retains the licensing
role and will be the contracting party. Mr Takkar stated that as the
Supreme Court had vacated a stay order on the telecom tenders, the
government would go ahead, although it would, of course, be subject to
any future Court ruling.

From: Steve Howard <steveh@townhall.ci.breckenridge.co.us>


I received the following letter last week from the Colorado Public
Utilities Commission (IMHO, these people usually do a pretty good
job!).

I thought Digest readers might enjoy it.  If you have any comments/advice 
re: local phone competition, please e-mail me.  I will go to one of
these meetings next week and any helpful comments would be appreciated!

(All typos are mine!) 

Steve

             -------------------------------------------

Dear Colleague,

You may be aware that the Colorado Legislature approved a bill in 
the 1995 legislative session which changes the monopoly status of
the local phone market.  The legislation instructs the Colorado
Public Utilities Commission to have rules in place by July 1, 1996.
These rules would allow for competition for local phone service 
throughout the state.

The legislation called for various appointed committees to study
the issues involved in changing from a monopoly system to a 
competitive local phone service marketplace.  These committees have
been asked to draft rules, which will be presented to the Commission
by the end of 1995.  The Commission will then start a rulemaking 
in 1996.

The Commission wants to ensure that the public's concerns are 
addressed in the rulemaking.  I am holding fourteen public meetings
across the state to obtain public input about a competitive local
phone service marketplace.  The schedule of meetings is enclosed,
and I hope you will take the time to attend the one nearest you.

Also enclosed in a proposed Telecommunications Consumers' Bill of
Rights, which has been drafted by Commission staff.  The proposed 
Bill of Rights covers many issues which we believe are important 
to consumers, such as, "If I change local phone companies, will I
be able to keep my phone number", or "Will my local phone company
be changed without my authorization?"

I'm sure you may have other issues that are not covered by the 
proposed Bill of Rights.  The Commission is open to all comments 
and would like to obtain your views.  The proposed Bill of Rights
should serve as a stepping stone to other discussion points.

If you are unable to attend any one of the meetings, I hope you 
will still provide the Commission with your comments.  Please feel

What is the legality of selling an internet service which provides
international voice communications over the internet using a POTS
interface on one or both sides (i.e. you call up the access number,
enter the international POTS number or IP number you are calling, and
then go to voice communications with the other side)?

I recognize there are financial and technical problems with this, but
I am only asking a question of legality.

Here is some Interesting information for Telecom professionals looking

Telecommunications Consultants (ATC) and it is based in Baltimore,
Maryland.  This company offers an on-line, national database comprised
of hundreds of independent telecommunications consultants in virtually
every specialty area.

The database is menu driven and fairly easy to understand. Menus allow
you to search by consultant name, location, experience, specialization
or any combination thereof.  I have found it to be very helpful and
the cost is only a long distance telephone call.

Subject: Eliminate Dialing Weirdnesses - We Can Save Lives
Organization: Dave Yost's house


Our telephone systems should be straightforward enough that any child
capable of remembering their phone number can be taught how to pick up
any phone and dial their home phone number or 911.

Try it sometime with a five-year-old.  You can teach her her phone
number, and you can teach her about 911, but it's really hopeless to
explain what to do in all the various telephone situations:

  * calling home or 911 from an office phone requiring 9+;
  * calling home or 911 from a hotel room requiring 9+ or 8+ or worse;
  * calling home from a pay phone with no money;
  * calling home from her own area code if you've
    taught her her complete phone number, or from
    outside her area code if not.

It doesn't have to be this way.  Telephone systems are now
sufficiently programmable that we can fix this over time if we decide
to.

We should work toward a standard that would allow a child to dial
simply 1 + area code + number from any phone, whether it be a business
phone, a pay-phone, whatever, and get connected to their home.  Better
yet, 0 + country code + area code + number from anywhere in the world.

I wonder how many lost children would have been found if they could
have successfully dialed their home phone when they had an opportunity.

Problems to be solved:

Business and Hotel phones:

    Business phones usually require you to dial 9 for an
    outside line.  Hotels sometimes require 8.  There was
    a time, back in the old pulse-dial days, when this
    made some sense.  Now it doesn't.  PBX systems with
    push-button phones could use the * or # key to access
    internal dialing, and allow normal dialing to the
    outside without a prefix.  We could require new
    systems to offer this facility, and old ones could
    be required to offer it as a software upgrade if
    feasible.  (The phone system manufacturers should
    welcome this revenue opportunity.)

Pay phones:

    Pay phones are not child-friendly when you dial 1 +
    area code + number without using the correct amount
    of change.  They could be reprogrammed to say
    something like this:

    "Don't hang up.  Someone will come on the phone to
    help you, or you can insert 20 cents (or whatever) to
    connect your call automatically."

    Immediately and automatically, the called party
    should be contacted with a recording that says
    "Someone is trying to call you from a pay phone in
    <city> without paying.  Say "yes" if you agree to pay
    for the call." If callee has lost a child, they will
    know what to do!  If not and they decline, then an
    operator should talk with the person at the pay phone
    and handle the situation, possibly initiating a
    collect call with the name of the caller or
    forwarding the call to 911.

Calling from within the area code:

    If you dial your own area code, you get a recording
    saying you did something wrong.  This should be
    reprogrammed so that such a call goes through as a
    normal local call.

Special hookups for emergencies:

    In the case of a lost or kidnapped child, a
    subscriber should be able to request that a special
    unblockable Caller ID logging unit be attached to
    their line so that the police or FBI can trace a
    relevant incoming call when alerted.

If we make these changes, then eventually even a very
young child can be taught that in a jam, they can just

    "pick up any phone, dial our home telephone number,
    and we'll answer.  Even if you don't get to speak, it
    will help to know where you called from."

If you know the electronic or paper mail address of any group to whom
I should send this idea, please tell me.  Some possibilities: missing
children groups, telephony standards organizations, government
regulators, lawmakers, ...?

I find it very interesting that there were published reports alluding
to this raid back in June.  "Computer Underground Digest" Volume 7
issue 54 (http://sun.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/CUDS7/cud754) mentions a
story in {USA Today} that states "The FBI intends to raid the homes and
businesses of more than 3000 people" for viewing child porn through AOL.

It seems the magnitude of the raid was exaggerated, but they got other
details correct.  Apparently the story originated from the {Cincinnati

I think that this, in a nutshell, is what this is about. Authentication and 
verfication.  I would _hope_ that AOL would require a copy of the
message (or the attached file...) from a user wishing to lodge a
complaint.  Even then, this _does_ require some sort of judgment call
by AOL as to whether the message violated its TOS.  Then, they have
the legal recourse to forward this to the "proper" authorities.  (I'm
assuming that anything illegal, and some things that aren't would
violate the AOL TOS [yea acronyms]) With the TOS, AOL reserves the
right to police itself.  Whether this is a Good Thing, or a Bad Thing
is up to AOL and its subscribers.  I think a better discussion of
common carrier rights and responsibilities vis-a-vis the Feds would be
to start with Steve Jackson (what was the final result of that?) and
go from there.

I believe PAT has hit upon the common thread which ties the FBI Arrests 
topic to the AOL Chain Letter topic to the Stoned Scuba Diver Libel
topic: America On-Line really has no idea who the heck is using their
system. One of the big differences between AOL and, say, my company
account is _not_ that the former is granting Internet access to any
goofball with a PC, but that the latter is verifying identities first,
and holding me personally accountable for my Internet activity.

One of AOL's biggest problems, to the detriment of its Internet image
and the increase of its internal grief, is its infuriating tendency to
give away 10 hours of Internet access for free before even the most
perfunctory account verification. It's not alone in this (Prodigy
seems to have a lock on the Phone Sex Ad game), but nevertheless this
goes a long way towards increasing the noise/kiddieporn/junk-Email
problems endemic today. Were AOL to institute some fundamental
changes, such as read-only access until account identity is verified
through billing details, and cancellation of those stupid CB-like
handles, they might alleviate some of the grief that's currently
landing on them. If this is to be a (shudder) "Information Superhighway," 
AOL needs to recognize that they ought to be licensing their drivers.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I've heard from a few people that there is
a considerable problem with new-user fraud at AOL involving those 'ten

credit card and 'check-free' validation schemes latch onto lots of the
free software disks out of the back of magazines, etc. then use them for
whatever they are worth by enrolling under bogus names and credit cards.
Compuserve gets the same problem: they have free disks in magazines with
trial offers, etc. and people milk those for what they are worth also.  PAT]

At this juncture It would be wise for members of this group to take a
look at the excellent book "Make NO Law" written by Anthony Lewis of
the {New York Times}. It is the history of {Sullivan v. New York Times}
which established the principal of "Wilful malice" as the standard for
libel and slander.

In addition the Electronic Frontier Foundation archives 
//www.eff.org has a excellent collection of documents relating to this
issue.  

One of the theories that EFF is developing is that since Net users
"Thrust themselves into the Public Spotlight" by the very act of being
on the Net ... their statements must meet the Sullivan tests of libel.

More work for lawyers I'm afraid.

We have an almost identical situation here in Vancouver, BC.  Upon
calling the administrative 7D number listed in the phone book, we are
generally referred to the 911 number instead, the resaon stated is
that they cannot connect you anyhwere from the 7D number.  I have a
suspicion that what they want is access to the CallerID database so
that they have your name, address and phone number on all incoming
calls (for they certainly do have it when you access them on 911).

        In Oklahoma, there has been very little controversy about how
to properly use 911.  The idea is that it is only to be used for
situations that effect the safety of people or property in which very
quick response is needed.

In Stillwater, there are no 911 operators as such.  The voice you hear
answer the 911 line is a police and fire dispatcher who is also the
same voice you will hear if you dial the seven-digit number for the
police station.

        The 911 lines terminate at a console in the dispatchers' office in
the basement of City hall.  Since we have enhanced 911, the dispatcher sees
the name and address of the caller before the telephone is even answered.

        One of our local amateur radio clubs toured the dispatcher's
office at around 8:00, one evening.  It was very quiet and orderly
with three or four people at their work stations taking the occasional
telephone or radio call.  There were no 911 calls while we were there,
but the usual routine radio and telephone traffic for a town of 30,000
people was in full swing.

        I said something to one of the dispatchers about those cases
in which people have accidentally dialed 911 while trying to program a
telephone or through some other mistake.  He said that dispatchers are
much more understanding if you stay on the line long enough to explain
what happened than if you just hang up because they don't know whether
somebody just got hit over the head or they are having telephone
trouble or what.

        When enhanced 911 came to Tulsa and Oklahoma City, the media
featured many stories about what it did and how to use it.  One of the
things that was repeated several times was an admonition to the public
not to test it since this would clog the lines with unnecessary calls.

        Both Tulsa and Oklahoma city have had the occasional minor
problems with equipment failures and human mixups, but we are fortunate 
not to have had some of the more terrifying scandals as have happened
in other cities.

This is true here in Toronto, but a few years ago it certainly was not.

The emergencies pages at the front used to show 911 (and before that
361-1111 and before that EM1-1111) for emergencies, all right.  But
right below that, in smaller print, they used to give the regular police
number (324-2222, and before that 967-2222).  Seems eminently sensible
to me.  Anyone know why Bell decided to change it?  It's not as if a
call to 324-2222 couldn't be transferred to the dispatchers at 911.

They added those hideous hyphens in the middle of 911, too.  Is there
any actual evidence for the popular account of someone so stupid they
looked for an 11 key?  (But presumbly not so stupid as to look for a
hyphen key?)

Incidentally, the EM exchange was really EMpire.  The EMergency number
continued to be written with the EM for years after other 36- numbers
were written with digits.

At least we don't have that problem, at least not if you can figure
out how to use the "easier to use" government pages.  Right there in
the Metro Toronto section: "METROPOLITAN TORONTO POLICE .. 324-2222".
Interestingly, there is no listing for 911 there.

In the business section we have both:

        METROPOLITAN TORONTO POLICE
          40 College ..................... 324-2222
          EMERGENCIES
            Life Threatening ................ 9-1-1
            Crimes in Progress .............. 9-1-1
            TDD-Only ........................ 9-1-1

before it continues with the administrative and individual department
numbers.  There is also a listing under P:

        POLICE
          EMERGENCY CALLS - APPELS D'URGENCE  9-1-1
        Police Commission (Metropolitan Toronto)
          40 College ..................... 324-2222

(The police commission is not actually the same as the police, but as
they have the same address and phone number...)

And not to forget, they also have:

        AMBULANCE EMERGENCY CALLS -
                            APPELS D'URGENCE  9-1-1
        FIRE
          EMERGENCY CALLS                     9-1-1

The residential section also has the last two listings.  Their listing
under P is sort of amusing:

As a human-factors psychologist in training, I found this paragraph
very, very interesting.  It makes a good point: 9-1-1 is good human
factors, because it is short, easy to remember, and CONSISTENT across
most of the United States.  If you're in a strange city, you can feel
pretty confident that 9-1-1 will work.

The flip side is: there is no NON-emergency police number which is 
consistent across wide geographic areas.  That's bad human factors; it
requires a person to have fairly extensive customized knowledge about
abstract digits in order to get non-emergency help.  Since people are
fundamentally lazy, they dial what they can remember: 9-1-1.  If you're
in a strange city at a payphone with no phone book and you don't have
the change for directory assistance, the operator will probably put
you through to 9-1-1 anyway.

So, I think that a nationwide standardized NON-emergency police number
should be established.  I'm not sure what it should be, but it should
be easy to remember, preferably by way of being composed of bits of
knowledge that people already have.  IF there are no good technical 
reasons why not, I'd suggest 555-5911 as a possibility -- pick up a phone
in any city, dial 555-5911, and it will redirect you to the geographically
appropriate non-emergency telephone number.  That would be a local police
number if it could be determined, or state police for cellular or other
indeterminate locations.  People know 555 -- it's in virtually every
TV show and movie, after all.  They know 555-1212 is information.  They
know 911 is police.  So, 555-5911 would be easy to remember, because it's
made up of chunks of knowledge that people probably already have, so it
can be easily reconstructed.

What do the telecom experts think?  Am I reinventing a wheel that's already
been discarded?  Or has 9-1-1 overload not yet been considered *that* big 
a problem?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: For how many ever years, things used to
be pretty standard around here with xxx-2121 for the police and xxx-2131
for fire. If there were two small towns each with their own police and
fire departments but served by the same phone exchange, then one of them
got 2161/2171 instead. 1212 and 1313 were also commonly used. In Chicago,
the numbers were POLice 1313 and FIRe 1313. Later the L and the R were
replaced by 5 and 7 respectively. 312-765 and 312-347 have long since been
assigned to other uses, but back then they had a most interesting way of
telling where you were calling from. In the case of police, your telephone
central office saw your request for 765-1313 and translated it to another
number entirely, *then* sent it to the police dispatchers on that number.
It would always be some other exchange-1313 when the police got it, and
a large map in the dispatcher's office had lights on it that would flash
to tell them where (in general) the call was coming from. So if the
police got a call on their HARrison-1313 line the area on the map known
as Rogers Park would illuminate. On the other hand if the call came in
on WABash-1313 then another neighborhood would light up. There were ten
or fifteen such general geographic areas in the city, each with its own
exchange-1313 phone line, but all the public had to remember was to dial
POlice-5-1313. The dispatchers would then notify officers by radio as
they do now. When Chicago was using that system until about the early
1970's, a lot of the neighborhood police stations still had xxx-2121 as
their local phone, since many older people still insisted on calling the
local station direct, and 2121 was left over from a much earlier time
when there was no consolidated dispatch; indeed many of the older police
stations in the neighborhoods had been the location of the police in 
the village or town prior to its annexation as part of Chicago.

In the case of the Fire Department, all central offices north of 39th Street
translated their calls to the number DEArborn-1313 which rang at the
main fire alarm office in City Hall. Central offices south of 39th Street
translated their calls to TRIangle-0002 for some odd reason, which was
the number of the Englewood Fire Alarm Office on the south side. 39th Street
roughly divides the city in half since the south side is much, much
larger than the north side. The dispatchers would notify the local fire
stations by radio and an alarm signal they could set off. The fire
stations all had 'annunciator' boards -- large mechanical devices with
lights and buzzers which would go off when one of the 'pull boxes' on
a street corner had been activated. A common method of calling the Fire
Department fifty or sixty years ago was to run out of your (presumably
on fire) house and up to the corner where a red box was mounted on a
telephone pole. You pulled open the little trap door and yanked down a
lever. A spring-wound mechanism inside started doing whatever, and the
firemen got the signal in their station. The annunciator told them what
general vicinity (within a block or so) to go to. 

I cannot praise 911 highly enough when it works properly. Having the full
name, address and a narrative about the circumstances (such as a map or
details of nearby streets, etc) displayed on the screen is very helpful.
In the old days, people would get panicy and forget what their address
was ... seriously ... the fire phone would ring, and the dispatcher would
hear someone on the other end screaming for help because their house was
on fire ... 'hurry to 2503 Halsted Street' the person would scream and
then slam their phone down as they were running out the door. Well the
problem was ..*which* 2503 Halsted?  2503 North Halsted or 2503 South
Halsted ... and of course they had to dispatch men and equipment to both
locations knowing that one would report back a false alarm. 

Speaking of false alarms: they went down to almost zero -- at least 
those of a malicious nature -- once 911 was implemented. In the 1960's
the Chicago Fire Department used to receive as many as 150-200 false
alarms some days; just malicious and/or sick people who got off hearing
the sirens and watching all their neighbors in a panic, etc. Of course
they had to respond to each one, to the detriment of someplace where 
they were really needed. During 1968 and the considerable amount of
discontent that was present all over due to Vietnam, and the riots we
had twice that year, there were days we listened to the sirens all
day long as firemen would rush from one place to another only to be
greeted (at best) with a false alarm and other times (at worst) with
shots fired at them, their tires flattened while they were inside
a building looking for a non-existent fire, or their fire station 
looted of their personal possessions, food, etc while they were all
out. Citizens would volunteer to go stand watch at the fire house while
all the men were out just so that when they returned, their food
would still be in the refrigerator and their television set had not
'walked off'.  Most false alarms were written off as 'mistaken citizen
trying to be helpful' but now and then they caught someone at it.

911 was most welcome here when it was installed, although the usual
group of privacy freaks and ACLU'ers were just postive this would mark
the end of freedom as we know it; i.e. people would be 'afraid' to
call the police to snitch their neighbors if the police knew who they
were. People would 'not want to get involved' in reporting accidents, 
etc. for the same reasons.  PAT]

        I don't find in Mr. Casey's post where he said the service was
E911.  There are several other versions of 911 which do not have all
those features and cannot route the call to the right agency, only to
a central PSAP.  The central PSAP often the police or fire dispatcher
in the largest city in the area, and in some cases they may be less
diligent with calls from other jurisdictions and agencies they're
taking calls for.  At least some people have so claimed.

         I'm not sure why you would call the local telephone company
to demand an explanation.  The telephone company provides the service
that is ordered.  While they might like to provide a better type of
911 service, it's a matter of what the cities, etc., are willing to
pay for.

        "The 911 operator" does not work for the local telephone
company but is an employee of whatever agency operates the PSAP.
Unless there was a failure on the part of the local telephone company
(possible, but not likely since the type of operation described is
used in many places) calling the telephone company would not be of
value.

The moral of which is, when posting to Usenet, *keep to the 7-bit
ASCII character set*.  Terry obviously used some 8-bit character set
where hex B2 and B3 are left and right quotation marks, and the top
bit got deleted along the way.

Actually, a lot of Usenet these days is 8-bit clean; in my experience
lately it tends to be email channels where 8-bit characters get
mangled (either losing their high bit, or being converted to MIME in
the hope that the recipient can read that).  This being a moderated
newsgroup, of course its postings *are* emailed.

But even 8-bit-clean transmission doesn't help unless the *same* 8-bit
character set is used by sender and recipient.  In my case, if the
characters had gone through intact, I would have seen them as
superscript-2 and superscript-3, which is what hex B2 and B3 are in
ISO 8859-1.

You receive a special intercept informing you to dial 611 to activate
your phone service, and 911 for emergencies. The switch waits until
you dial 7D to give this message. The number readback code also works,
yielding a valid 7D number in the switch that when called from a
working phone provides a vacant (not in service) message.

I commend Bell Canada for this great leap forward in customer service. 
I can think of a few 'Bell' companies here in the U.S. who could stand
to take a lesson from Bell Canada.  My local Bell Operating Company
just treated me to a $38.50 off-site (i.e. on-line) activation charge
to turn up service at my new townhouse - a substantial charge to
accomplish roughly the same thing Bell Canada is doing with its "Soft"
Dial Tone.

My recent experience points to the overwhelming need for deregulation
and competition.  With the $38.50 "activation" charge, my RBOC is
selling the perception that it is installing a new line that didn't
exist previously.  In fact, they are selling an installation in
cyberspace, that will occur with a few strokes of the keyboard.

This selling of services based on the perception of technolgical or
other synergies reminds me of the pre- and early-divestiture AT&T,
charging for line conditioners and customer premises equipment, and
maintaning market share through brand-name recognition, etc.  I welcome
the day when market competition will drive our RBOCs to Bell Canada's
level of customer service.

Pat, I think you missed the point ... it's good that the soft-dialtone 
phones can dial 611, because it's a pseudo-standard.  Like you said,
most areas use 611 for repair.  However, it's bad that once you get
real dialtone, 611 doesn't work anymore, and you have to dial some
other number.  How unnecessarily confusing!  Your first experience
with your new phone is "611 is for repair/service."  The next time you
have a problem, most likely you think, "611 is for repair" -- and it
doesn't work.  You probably get a recording or a reorder tone, and
perhaps you have to find the phone book and look up the number, which
probably isn't easy to remember.

If the company is NOT going to use 611 for most repair calls, they
shouldn't use it for soft-dialtone, either.  That way, it won't be
confusing, and it won't encourage new users to start out by learning
the wrong number.

Rochester Telephone is one of those companies that doesn't use the 611
standard.  Instead, you need to dial 777-1611 -- 777 is RochTel's
internal prefix, but until you play a few games of phone tag with the
phone company, you probably won't realize that. :) At least they used
"611" in the number ... but IMHO, they should've just used "611" to
begin with.

My recollection is that NYNEX has been using this for at least three
years (although they still called themselves "New England Telephone"
at the time).  Probably implementation varied depending on the kind
and maintenance record of the switch.  Certainly this was the case
back in 1992 when I moved into a new apartment in Burlington, Vermont,
and last year when I left there and came to Boston.

<SIT> If this is an emergency, dial 9-1-1.  If you would like to
establish telephone service on this line, please call NYNEX customer
service at NXX-XXXX.  If you would like to speak to an operator, dial
0.

Well, you are right. But I think this discussion is rather technical.
Besides the different requirements for the signalling systems between
a fixed lenght and a variable lenght numbering system, there are
obvious reasons in favour of a fixed length numbering system.

If you want to implement a fixed length numbering system in a network,
then you have to take serious precautions in your design of the system
into account. So in fact, you have to think quite seriously about the
future number demand and other developments, that are crucial to the
design of such a numbering system. A variable lenght numbering system
on the other hand, does not require such emphasis on those
considerations. Well, you just start to assign numbers, and if the
available numbering space is completely used, then you have to do
changes to the current numbers. In Germany this is usually done by
adding some digits to a current number. Such changes usually create
additional cost to the network operator, and the subscribers dont like
such changes at all. Therefore a fixed length numbering system has
major advantages as the need to change any numbers is rather low.

Then, in the long term, fixed length numbering system tend to have
shorter numbers in average than variable length numbering systems.
This is true for Germany. Germany in fact has a total population of 80
millions, and there are 11 digit numbers in use. Well, those long
numbers are still rather seldom to find, but Telekom seems to use such
long numbers nowadays on a regular bases. On the other side, the world
zone 1, which incorporates the USA, Canada and some Caribbean
countries, has just 10 digit phone numbers.  But the world zone 1 has
a total population of nearly 300 millions.  Therefore it should be
asked, how such a large population can be served using just 10 digit
numbers, wheras on the other hand, Germany with a significantly
smaller population needs 11 digit numbers in some places?

I think the answer is rather simple. As I stated earlier, there is no
need to define such a numbering system rather precisely. Instead you
may add and add and add digits to accomodate the "need" of local
numbers. But as there is no general outline or design structure
available, such systems tend to use the theoretcial numbering space
quite inefficiently. Local aministrations will usually start to assign
short numbers. And if it will become obvious, that such short numbers
will not suffice the upcoming demand, then you have to introduce
longer numbers. And whats even worse, most German local numbers are
not just rather short, they are in fact way too short! The German city
of Karlsruhe has a population of around 200'000.  If you consider a
large number of businesses that have a high demand for DID numbers,
then the minimum length should be 6 digits. Well, but in that city
there are also 5 digit numbers. And on the other side, Telekom has
also assigned 7 and 8 digits numbers. If you add the local area code
to such a 8 digit number, then you end up with 11 digits, which does
not include the leading 0 to initiate an area code prefixed call. So
if you want to reach someone in Karlsruhe, then you may have to dial
more digits, than to reach any subscriber in a large US metro area.

One of the reasons for this inefficient use of phone numbers are DID
numbers. Most companies in Germany have DID lines. If you want to
reach the extension 123 you could dial 6454-123. But if you want to
reach the company's operator then you just dial 6454-0. As a result of
this -0 number, you "waste" 99 phone numbers. If you do this rather
often, then you will even waste hundreds of millions of phone numbers.

Another major design flaw of variable length phone numbers that will
become obvious is the introduction of different long distance and
local networks.  This design flaw aroses from the fact, that local
numbers have no "structure" or no structure that can be easily
predicted. But this will become neccessary to allow in local networks
an efficient routing. The way this is done in the USA is rather
simple. Any local network operator can get portions of 10'000 phone
numbers. Such a portion consists of a 3 digit prefix and 4 digit
numbering space from 0000 to 9999. For the routing the fixed length of
the prefix will work extremely well, as you may add any number of such
prefixes to a routing table, even if those prefixes are used
"chaotic". So a nearly unlimited number of local operators may get
such a compact portion of phone numbers. This allows an efficient
distribution of phone numbers, and there is a single and simple
routing possible, as the number of significant digits for the routing
in a phone number is limited to 3 digits.

But fixed length phone numbers have also a very obvious advantage for
the subscribers. Because you always know, if a number is complete or
not. In a variable length numbering system, you will never be able to
tell, if the number is complete, as within the country, or even within
a city, there are shorter or longer numbers in use.

For me it seems obvious that in the long run, all major countries will
implement fixed length numbering systems.

There are quite a few variable-length phone numbers presently in use
in North America. These are found in automated attendant systems which
prompt a caller to enter the extension of the person desired. The
difficulty is, of course, that the additional digits cannot be entered
until the call is answered and the automaton is ready.

What would it take for an originating switch to accept digits beyond those
it figures are necessary to complete the call, buffer them, and then
transmit them after the call is supervised? If the called party was not
an automaton, the tones might be slightly annoying to a human, but not
an insurmountable obstacle. If the caller didn't enter extra digits when
they were needed, he would still be prompted as today.

Wouldn't a scheme like this make it possible to effectively move to
variable-length numbers without a need to alter the fundamental character-
istics of the system? Later, after everyone got used to the new technique,
real variable-length numbers could be introduced transparently.

Of course, companies which advertise vanity numbers of more than seven
characters might have some problems...

I would like to hear from anyone with experience using voice
compression techniques in T1 muxes. I need as much of the bandwidth of
my T1s as possible for data, but had to cost-justify the T1s by
including reductions in voice telco expenses. I will probably be using
Newbridge muxes (3600 & 3624), which seem to support a voice-path at
as low as 8kbps. Although it leaves more for data, I'm concerned about
degraded quality. Of 8, 16 or 32kbps, I'm sure 32 is the least
objectionable for the telemarketing people who will be on the phones,
but what kind of quality might I expect?  Are there other mux vendors
who provide better quality at low bandwidths?

For pagers.  The dealers don't need them, their customers do.  They
dial the dealer's pager and the dealer calls them back.  And your
average street junkie probably isn't going to Radio Shaft to buy a
tone device -- at least until that becomes the only way to make the

The drug and prostitution trade is heavily dependent on the use of
pagers and cell phones. For example, if you call your local dealer,
Bill, for a delivery, he pages a runner to make the delivery. The
runner, who may be a juvenile (won't do time that way), picks up the
drugs, makes the delivery and returns with the cash. Or he may just
make the delivery to an intermediary who then delivers to you. Again,
all this is coordinated via pagers and/or cell phones. In the sex
trade, if you call an "escort service" or a "nude maid service", the
dispatcher calls a girl in via pager. If you make a streetcorner deal
with a pimp, he coordinates his men or women via pagers.

Here in Houston, the "war on payphones" has taken two tacks. At some
locations (mainly convenience stores) the payphones are disabled at
night.  At other locations, the payphones are blocked from calling
pager and/or cellular phone exchanges. Since they started doing this,
I haven't noticed a great decrease in the drug or sex for pay trade,
but it sure makes the Telco and the Stop-N-Rob corporations look as if
they are doing something.

I suspect that one big use is to interact with paging services, in
order to activate their cohort's pagers/display a callback number/etc.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I have a pager here from Mobile Comm,
which is a Bell South Company. It is the brand being sold by Radio
Shack in this part of the country at the present time. Although you can
use a touch tone phone to send a message to the display window, you
can also just use it as a signal for an answering machine. If someone
calls from a rotary phone or a phone where the touch tones have been
disabled, all they need to do is dial the number and leave a message
anyway. In that case, the pager shows its own number in the display.
So, it requires an extra phone call: one to call voicemail and see who
left the message and a second call to the actual person calling. I
don't think that would be any big extra problem for a drug dealer.  PAT]

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I think their rate of return for legitimate

few bogus orders go through now and then. They are far more interested 
in making it as easy as possible for new customers who want to use their

services slammed in error. If they get hundreds of new customers over some
period of time via phone call solicitation versus a couple of bad ones,
its easier to settle with the bad ones. 

Remember the door-to-door encyclopedia salesmen of years ago? Are they
still around?  They had lists of which people in the community had
school age children, and they tended to work in poorer, rural communities.
As a sample, they had the *one* volume of their crummy twenty-five
volume encyclopedia which had a picture in it; a nice glossy photo of
President Roosevelt. They went door to door taking orders with their
gimmick being you were selected by the publishers to get the entire 
encyclopedia for free; all you have to do is purchase the annual
updates for the next ten years. If you said you would take the free
enclycopedia but were not interested in the updates then the salesman
'questioned' whether or not he wanted to leave such valuable books at
the home of someone who 'did not care enough' to keep them up to date.
They appealed to very poor minority parents who in all fairness wanted
the best education for their children they could have. 

Needless to say, plenty of poor, uneducated people fell for the gimmick
and signed papers committing to how much they would pay each month on
the annual updates, which after ten years came to *four times* the
price of a good, recognized encyclopedia set. The set of books would
show up by parcel post a few days later and the paperwork was sent to
Chicago where it was processed by 'the loan company which lent you the
money to purchase the books for your children'. The first thing the
'loan company' did was verify the order. You see, the door-do-door
sales people were these young guys -- social dropouts for the most part --
who were not above lying and misrepresenting the product they were
selling. And the 'loan company' had a woman do the verifying who taped
the entire conversation. Originally they had not done that but the
stinks to the Federal Trade Commission and others got so bad about
door-to-door salespeople in general (this was 1950-60's) that the
FTC and other government agencies cracked down hard. They made all the
'acceptance companies' (that is, the companies which forwarded the
money to the salesmen then tried to collect it from the salesmen's
customer/suckers) *prove without a doubt* that their orders were
legal and in fact existed. 

The verifier was completely honest, although deceptive in her choice
of words. She told the people she was calling to verify their decision
to 'accept the wonderful free gift the publisher was making available
to school children in the community' and how much it would cost each
month for the 'free gift'. She told them she was tape recording the
conversation, and asked their approval to do so (which was also on
the tape.) Remember, she was speaking with awfully dumb people to 
begin with. At the close of the verification conversation she would
thank them 'for allowing me to tape record this as we have been
speaking so there will not be any errors in the way your order is
handled.'

And six months or so later, when the order invariably went to the
loan company's collection agency (same people just wearing different
hats and using other phone lines) the recipients of the free encyclopedia
would insist they did not know why they were getting letters and phone
calls from collectors for a 'loan company in Chicago' that 'we don't
owe any money to.' Meanwhile, the salesmen were busy selling their
books at another town somewhere, staying in a sleazy motel for a few
days while they milked all the suckers there before moving on.   PAT]

Unless the routing was changed in the past two months, 800-555-1212
should not be blocked from student phones (I went to great pains to
program the campus PBXs to not block this number).  There will be some
phones it will not work from: courtesy phones, etc. that are restricted

As far as whether its 'illegal' or not; the University, because it is

Subject: New Developments in AOL/FBI Case


I now have copies of two of the criminal complaints filed against AOL
users arrested in the operation.  Granted, this is only two cases out
of 12 arrests and a lot of search warrants.  However, neither mentions
AOL monitoring mail or listening in on chat rooms.

In one case actual files, NOT random unwarranted assertions, were 
forwarded to the FBI by a confidential informant.  The complaint 
describes this person as a "concerned citizen" who has been cooperating 
with the FBI for about 12 months and makes it clear that he or she is not 
a suspect in any criminal matter.  There is certainly no shortage of such 
concerned citizens who would be willing to forward things they came 
across to authorities.  Several of them testified before Congress when 
they were doing hearings on the CDA and the Dole/Grassley Bill.  One had 
been collecting images and reporting the senders to AOL for quite some 
time and was frustrated that no action seemed to be taking place.  I have 
no difficulty whatsoever believing that this individual would gladly 
collect information for an FBI operation designed to put it to a stop.

In the other case, the images were obtained by an FBI agent who went into 
a chat room posing as a 15 year old boy and had images sent to him 
directly from the suspect.

In both cases, the only mentioned involvement on the part of AOL is that 
AOL under subpoena, gave the FBI the user profile of the two screen 
names.  This included the actual name of the account holder, his AOL 
account number, account status, mailing address and telephone numbers, 
and other screen names associated with that account.

The FBI went on to check telephone records to confirm that calls were 
being placed from the suspect's phone number to AOL dialup numbers, as 
well as other odd bits of data.  In one case they confirmed what kind of 
car the suspect drove in some way that wasn't mentioned.  They also 
checked install dates for telephone and electric service - presumably to 
prove that the AOL profile information was correct before obtaining 
search warrants.

Say what you will about any of this, but it seems clear that AOL was 
involved as little as possible, responding to subpoenas with information 
which was not derived from monitoring of protected communications.  Nor 
is there any evidence of an AOL "enemies list" of suspected child 
pornographers.

More may come to light as other filings become available, but for now 
(gall me though it may to defend AOL) it seems clear that Pat's take on 
what happened is not supported by the facts.

 Date: Sun, 17 Sep 1995 21:41:01 -0700 (PDT)

As some of you may recall, a few weeks ago I posted a
reverse-compilation of the random number generation routine used by
netscape to choose challenge data and encryption keys.

Recently, one of my officemates (David Wagner <daw@cs.berkeley.edu>)
and I (Ian Goldberg <iang@cs.berkeley.edu>) finished the job
of seeing exactly how the encryption keys are picked.

What we discovered is that, at least on the systems we checked (Solaris
and HP-UX), the seed value for the RNG was fairly trivial to guess by
someone with an account on the machine running netscape (so much so
that in this situation, it usually takes less than 1 minute to find
the key), and not too hard for people without accounts, either.
See below for details.

I've included the header to a program we wrote to do this key-cracking
below.  I would like to get some information, though:

o Where should I put the full source (1 file, ~12k) so that ITAR lovers
  don't get mad at me?

o Where can I find a version of netscape that does RC4-128?  It is
  likely that it suffers from the same problem, and even a brute-force
  search of the entire seed space is _much_ less than 128 bits.

Happy hacking,

     it is likely that RC4-128 will have the same problems).

    The idea is this: netscape seeds the random number generator it uses
    to produce challenge-data and master keys with a combination of the
    time in seconds and microseconds, the pid and the ppid.  Of these,
    only the microseconds is hard to determine by someone who
    (a) can watch your packets on the network and
    (b) has access to any account on the system running netscape.

    Even if (b) is not satisfied, the time can often be obtained from
    the time or daytime network daemons; an approximation to the pid can
    sometimes be obtained from a mail daemon (the pid is part of most
    Message-ID's); the ppid will usually be not much smaller than the pid,
    and has an higher than average chance of being 1.  Clever guessing
    of these values will in all likelihood cut the expected search space
    down to less than brute-forcing a 40-bit key, and certainly is less
    than brute-forcing a 128-bit key.

    Subsequent https: connections after the first (even to different hosts)
    seem to _not_ reseed the RNG.  This makes things much easier, once
    you've broken the first message.  Just keep generating 16 bytes of
    random numbers until you get the challenge-data for the next message.
    The next key will then be the 16 random bytes after that.

    main() and bits of MD5Transform1 by Ian Goldberg <iang@cs.berkeley.edu>
    and David Wagner <daw@cs.berkeley.edu>.  The rest is taken from the
    standard MD5 code; see below.

    This code seems to want to run on a big-endian machine.  There may be
    other problems as well.  This code is provided as-is; if it causes you
    to lose your data, sleep, civil liberties, or SO, that's your problem.

 #include <std/disclaimer.h>

    On the command line, give the time in seconds, the pid, the ppid and
    the SSL challenge data (each byte in hex, separated by some non-hex
    character like a colon) of the _first_ SSL message generated by
    the instance of netscape.  This program will search through the
    microsecond values.  You may need to run it again with a slightly
    different value for the seconds, depending on how accurately you know
    the time on the system running netscape.  The output will be the
    master key (all 16 bytes; note you never even told the program the
    11 bytes you knew) and the value for the microseconds that produced it.

    As a benchmark, this code runs in just under 25 seconds real time
    (for an unsuccessful search through 1<<20 values for the microseconds)
    on an unloaded HP 712/80.

Seriously, where's the NSA when you really need 'em?

If the "flaws" are being found by our group, as John notes, just what is
the NSA doing in the _second_ role it is supposed to have, it's "COMSEC,"
or communications security, role?

(Note: As outlined by Bamford, and others, the Agency has a dual role:
penetrating communications it is chartered to penetrate, and helping to
secure communications it is chartered to help secure. Traditionally, the
penetrating side is called SIGINT or COMINT, and the securing side is
called COMSEC. The names may have changed by now.)

Personally, I don't actually _want_ them vetting the work of others, but I
think this whole series of events with Netscape makes it abundantly clear
that the supposed "dual role" of the NSA in both breaking ciphers and in
ensuring higher security is a farce.

If the NSA had not found the flaws our two Berkeley grad students found,
we've grossly overestimated them as a threat. And if they found the flaws
but said nothing, what does this say about their claimed COMSEC benefits to
American interests? (Granted, not all of us are Americans, but I think you
understand my point about the NSA claiming it has a role, then doing
nothing concrete, and even being misleading in its plans and programs.)

If the NSA _really_ wants to really help secure communications against
fraud, eavesdroppers, and foreign intelligence agencies, it can do so by
immediately relaxing the restrictions on crypto export. While this may not
stop things like weak random number generators, it moves us to an era of
"strong" crypto and away from the "toy" crypto the NSA seems to want us to
have.

I think, however, it's clear by now that they have little interest in
helping to secure communications and that weak "toy" systems are their
preference.

Subject: Netscape Security Breach


POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY IN NETSCAPE PRODUCTS 
NETSCAPE RESPONDING IMMEDIATELY TO UPGRADE CUSTOMERS AND MINIMIZE RISK
OF FUTURE THREATS

During regular monitoring of Internet security newsgroups, Netscape
has discovered a potential vulnerability in the current version of
Netscape Navigator. Late Sunday evening, two U.C.-Berkeley students
posted a message to the Internet detailing their efforts to
reverse-engineer some security capabilities of Netscape Navigator.
Their efforts revealed how the program generates session encryption
keys, enabling them to replicate these keys with a moderate amount of
computing power and decipher messages sent across the Internet. The
potential vulnerability has since been confirmed by Netscape
engineers. With this knowledge, an experienced computer programmer
could decrypt messages sent by Netscape Navigator to other computers
in a few hours of computation time.

Netscape secure software has been in use for almost a year on the
Internet by millions of customers and no thefts of actual customer
information protected by our security have been reported - this
posting on the Internet reported a potential vulnerability, not the
actual theft of customer information. Netscape plans to address this
vulnerability quickly by providing updated software as soon as
possible via the Internet. An updated version of Netscape Navigator
1.1 for Mac OS and Unix and Netscape Navigator 1.2 for Windows 3.1 and
Windows 95 will be available for downloading by existing customers on
the Internet next week. In addition, Netscape Navigator 2.0, which was
announced on September 18 and will be available next week in beta
versions, includes this improvement as well as a number of additional
security features.

TECHNICAL BACKGROUND

Current versions of Netscape Navigator use random information to
generate session encryption keys of either 40 or 128 bits in length.
The random information is found through a variety of functions that
look into a user's machine for information about how many processes
are running, process ID numbers, the current time in microseconds,
etc. The current vulnerability exists because the size of random input
is less than the size of the subsequent keys. This means that instead
of searching through all the 2^128 possible keys by brute force, a
potential intruder only has to search through a significantly smaller
key space by brute force. This is substantially easier problem to
solve because it takes much less compute time and means 40-bit or
128-bit key strength is substantially reduced.

SOLUTION

Netscape is already implementing a fix to the specific portion of our
software where this vulnerability exists. We plan to address the
problem by significantly increasing the amount of random information
that cannot be discovered by external sources from approximately 30
bits to approximately 300 bits. In addition, the random information
will be made much more difficult to replicate because we will greatly
expand the techniques and sources used to generate the random
information. Once this improvement is made, protection of the random
information will be as strong as the rest of the security built into
Netscape Navigator.

Netscape has also begun to engage an external group of world-class
security experts who will review our solution to this problem before
it is sent to customers. These experts will validate Netscape's
solution and insure that it is complete and effective in solving this
vulnerability. The group will be used on an ongoing basis to work with
Netscape's internal security experts to review the design and
implementation of security in Netscape's products and to provide an
additional measure of assurance that these products implement the
highest levels of security possible.

This discovery does not affect the strength or security of SSL (Secure
Sockets Layer), RC4, or any other portions of our security
implementations.  The fix will restore Netscape security across all
products to the true 40-bit level for export and true 128-bit level
for U.S.  customers intended before this discovery. Current versions
of Netscape Navigator should be replaced with updated versions that
will be made available next week.  The risk of vulnerability is
significantly less on the Netscape Commerce Server, particularly if
administrative access to the computer is restricted. Netscape will
nevertheless issue a patch for all its Commerce Server customers.

UPDATING CUSTOMERS

Netscape will provide the fix for export (40-bit) versions of Netscape
Navigator next week for downloading by customers on the Internet.
Similarly, the Commerce Server patch for export versions (40-bit) will
be made available from our <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">home
page</A>.  Because downloading from the Internet of 128-bit versions
of the software is still not permitted by U.S. law, U.S. customers of
Netscape Navigator, Netscape Navigator Personal Edition, and Netscape
Commerce Server using 128-bit versions can request the replacement
from Netscape for delivery through the regular mail.

For additional information or replacements for 128-bit versions of
software that you have already purchased, please call the Netscape
Replacement Desk at 415/528-3600, email replace@netscape.com, or
contact your existing Netscape representative directly. We will inform
you immediately when the updated software is available for download.

Subject: Netscape Encryption Bug


According to published reports, Netscape's encryption software contains a
very well known security bug.  It generates a key using a "random number"
generator routine.  I use the quotes because typical library routines are
not in fact very random.  Using this knowledge a couple of students were
able to narrow down the possible keys enough to test and break them in a
minute or two.

This same bug occurred on Unix systems probably 20 years ago when someone
had the bright idea to generate random passwords for their Unix users to
prevent them from using common words and other known bad passwords.
Unfortunately, the random number generator they used was so poor that there
were only 4096 different passwords generated, which made it easy to find
them all by enumeration.

Netscape says they'll have a bugfix version of their browser out in a
few days.

This points out that for all its enormous stock market valuation,
Netscape is a very small company with bright but not terribly
sophisticated employees.  I still use their browser, but I'd short
their stock like crazy if I could.

I got a press release today that said that Cylink had won its patent
suit against RSA, and the court agreed that RSA had infringed Cylink's
patents on public key encryption.

The release was from Netmanage, Inc., who sell the popular Chameleon TCP/IP
suite.  It alluded to Netscape's security problems, and then said:

"NetManage and CYLINK, along with other major software and hardware
developers, will be announcing next week the release of a publicly
available security implementation which allows for 'plug & play'
interoperability for users of Internet security, and the endorsement
of protocol extensions which improve the reliability of current
proposed Internet security standards.  This open implementation will
not lock software or hardware developers into the use of encryption
technology from any one vendor."

Netmanage has done some other open interfaces in the past, e.g. the
one that people use for Windows ISDN TCP/IP connections.

If I've understood correctly, they've broken the 40 bit 'secure'
system -- the only one that is allowed to be used internationally.  I
could be wrong, though.

This news has been around for a while -- at least a month.  There's
been a lot of discussion on this, for example in 'comp.risks'

There is an update on that at http:/www.netscape.com/, but in brief
Netscape used too little random info to generate the key; about 30
random bits to generate 40- or 128-bit key. Of course, once they knew
that, by reverse engineering (I suspect by looking at the stolen
source code rather than by disassembling) they were able to run the
exhaustive search of 2^30 possible keys instead of 2^40 or 2^128. So
the problem is _NOT_ in the Connection Technology, but in Netscape
itself. The fix will be quite easy as well - just add more randomness.


Leo

PS. Imagine an automatic system that chooses an ATM password for you
(to make it "more random"). The password will be 6-digits, but the
system only asks for your age and sex to generate the password,
and does not use any more random info. You bet, there won't be much more
than 140 different passwords. Similarly for Netscape: they allegedly
used the current time (in seconds, that is, about 15 random bits
if the exact time of the transaction is not known, but the date is known;
much less otherwise), and the process ID (about 15 random bits in UNIX,
no randomness in DOS/Windows).

Today's {Denver Post} got a hold of this story and attempted an
"ordinary person" explanation.  What it looks like is that two grad
students, whose names I cannot remember but were published in the
article, were able to narrow down the key netscape automatically
creates because it was derived from an apparently fairly trivial
algorithm based upon time, network address, and some other
easy-to-figure-out stuff.  It looks like they narrowed it to within a
range they could provide to an application they wrote, which would
then take the encrypted sequence and figure it out within a minute or
two.

OOPS - I guess Netscape didn't allocate enough of thier multi-billion
dollar influx to testing their security algorithms ...

FOR RELEASE WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1995 

AT&T announces major restructuring for 21st Century 

NEW YORK -- AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen today announced plans for a
strategic restructuring that would separate AT&T into three publicly
traded, global companies.

Allen said the company was taking this bold step to capitalize on the
opportunities in each business' segment of the global information
industry -- communications services, communications equipment, and
transaction-intensive computing.

Under the plan, AT&T shareowners would hold shares in each company. A
fourth business -- AT&T Capital Corporation -- would be sold.

The AT&T Board of Directors approved pursuing the restructuring plan
at a special meeting this morning. AT&T hopes to complete all
transactions by the end of 1996.

"Changes in customer needs, technology and public policy are radically
transforming our industry," said Allen. "We now see this restructuring
as the next logical turn in AT&T's journey since divestiture. It will
make AT&T's businesses more valuable to our shareowners, even more
responsive to their customers, and better able to focus on the growth
opportunities in their individual markets.

"Under the plan announced today," Allen said, "one of the new companies 
would focus on providing the world's best `anytime, anywhere' communications 
and information services."

Operating under the familiar "AT&T" brand name, the services company
would consist of AT&T's current Communications Services Group, the
AT&T Universal Card Services Corporation, the newly established AT&T
Solutions consulting and systems-integration organization, and AT&T
Wireless Services, formerly McCaw Cellular Communications.

The company also plans to create an AT&T Laboratories unit around the
core of Bell Laboratories people dedicated to research and development
in communications services. In 1994, AT&T's services units had
combined revenues of more than $49 billion, making them the world
leader in the communications services market.

"AT&T's product and systems businesses, along with world-renowned Bell
Laboratories, would constitute a communications systems and technology
company that would immediately be the global leader in its industry,"
said Allen.

It would include AT&T's Network Systems Group, Global Business
Communications Systems, Consumer Products, AT&T Paradyne and
Microelectronics. In 1994, these businesses had total sales of
approximately $20 billion. The new company, as yet unnamed, would be a
powerful competitor in the fast-growing communications systems market.

AT&T is considering an Initial Public Offering for approximately 15
percent of the shares of the new equipment company in the first half
of 1996.

"Our services and systems businesses are at the intersection of
tremendous change and opportunity," said Allen. "This restructuring
ensures that each can follow the path of greatest opportunity without
worrying about bumping into each other along the way."

The company's computer unit, AT&T Global Information Solutions, would
be launched as an independent company by spinning it off to AT&T
shareowners, following an aggressive turnaround effort also announced
today.

GIS Chairman and CEO Lars Nyberg is taking decisive action to create a
smaller, more focused and swifter business. GIS will continue to
develop, manufacture and market computer platforms for any industry,
but will focus its unique capabilities on the three key industry
segments where it has a leading position -- financial, retail and
communications.

"Lars Nyberg is the right leader to get our computer business back on
track," said Allen.  "His goal is to be world-class in a few targeted
industry segments and in delivering high-quality computer platforms
and services. I believe that's not only worth doing, but doable. GIS's
customers and employees can count on AT&T's complete support during
this transition."

Nyberg assumed his post in June following a 20-year career at Philips
Electronics NV, where he turned around that company's computer
business.

As part of its turnaround effort, GIS will halt manufacture of
personal computers, ceasing distribution through value-added resellers
and retail outlets. It will continue to offer customers personal
computers as part of total solutions through an agreement with an
outside supplier that it expects to announce soon.

GIS will continue to support and service all its current hardware and
software installations and will aggressively market its service
capabilities to all industries. And it will continue to have a strong
commercial relationship with Bell Laboratories.

GIS -- which currently employs about 43,000 people in more than 120
countries -- also announced a major cost-cutting initiative that will
lead to the elimination of approximately 8,500 jobs.

AT&T will incur a one-time, pre-tax charge estimated at approximately
$1.5 billion against third-quarter earnings to cover the costs of the
GIS restructuring, reducing 1995 earnings by $1 billion, or 66 cents
per share. Excluding this charge, AT&T said it continues to target
earnings-per-share growth of at least 10 percent in 1995.

In addition, AT&T plans to sell its remaining interest in AT&T Capital
Corporation to the general public or to another company. AT&T holds in
excess of 80 percent of Capital Corp. shares, having sold a minority
interest to the general public in 1993. Capital Corp. is already one
of the largest equipment leasing and financing companies in the United
States. In 1994, it had revenues of approximately $1.4 billion and was
profitable.

Proceeds from the sale of Capital Corp. and from the initial public
offering of the new equipment business will be used to retire current
AT&T debt, giving each of the new businesses balance sheets
appropriate to its industry.

The company intends to adjust each business' capital structure to
ensure that it has the flexibility to raise resources as it needs
them. AT&T recognizes the importance of its relationship with its debt
holders. The company said its ability to satisfy its obligations to
its debt holders will not be impaired as a result of these
transactions.

AT&T said that each of the businesses it is establishing will have
everything it needs to meet customers' needs. Each already has
seasoned management and a productive work force.  Each has significant
global operations. The service, equipment and computer businesses each
has the sophisticated systems-integration capabilities necessary to
provide complete solutions to its set of customers. And, where it
makes sense to partner in serving a customer's needs, the new
businesses could establish commercial relationships with each other.

"Our first priority throughout this transition period is to ensure
that none of our businesses misses a beat on any customer commitment,"
Allen said.

Financial details on the transactions will be released as they become
available in accordance with securities regulations.

AT&T, which currently has some 303,000 employees, said it is too early
to estimate the exact employment impact of the planned restructuring.
On the one hand, all three new companies will need additional
resources to establish themselves as free-standing, independent
companies.  However, each company participates in a hotly competitive
market and will continue to size its operations as efficiently as
possible. On balance, it is likely that the combined new companies
will have fewer employees than the present AT&T.

The company said it will ensure that any employees dislocated by the
restructuring will have access to job opportunities across the total
corporation, as well as to a full range of assistance, ranging from
job counseling to retraining.

Allen, who will continue as chairman and CEO of the new AT&T, will
chair a committee of senior AT&T executives to oversee the
restructuring. The committee members are Hal Burlingame, senior vice
president of Human Resources; Marilyn Laurie, senior vice president of
Public Relations and Employee Communications; Rick Miller, executive
vice president and chief financial officer, and John Zeglis, senior
vice president and general counsel.

Allen also appointed senior officers to lead the transition of each
new company. They are: Alex J.  Mandl, CEO of the Communications
Services Group, for the communications services company; Richard A.
McGinn, CEO of the Network Systems Group, for the systems and
technology company; along with the incumbent CEOs of GIS, Lars Nyberg,
and AT&T Capital Corporation, Thomas C. Wajnert. Allen said that the
company's Board of Directors would name the permanent executive
leadership at the appropriate time.

All of these transactions are expected to be tax-free to shareowners.
AT&T intends to seek rulings from the Internal Revenue Service with
respect to the tax-free treatment of the transactions.  While AT&T
does not anticipate the need for regulatory, Department of Justice or
decree court approvals, the company did call attention to the
complexity of the issues to be resolved in the months ahead.

For example, immediate disposition of AT&T's final 20 percent interest
in AT&T Capital Corp.  would require modifications to certain existing
agreements. While AT&T is confident of its ability to resolve all
these issues, there can be no guarantee that the restructuring plan
will be implemented or that changes in the plan will not be made. The
investment banking firm of Morgan Stanley and the law firm of Wachtell
Lipton Rosen & Katz are serving as advisers to AT&T.


Editors' Note: AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen will hold a news

CNN - AT&T breakup - Sept. 20, 1995

AT&T to quit PC business, split into three companies 

Huge corporate breakup means loss of 8,500 jobs

September 20, 1995
Web posted at: 11:35 a.m. EDT

NEW YORK (CNN) -- Telecommunications giant AT&T announced a bold new
strategy Wednesday, one that marks the biggest corporate breakup in
history.

In an effort to slash bloated budgets and focus on long-distance
communications, AT&T said it will eliminate its personal computer
business and divide into three separate companies.

The move means the end of 8,500 jobs in AT&T's Global Information
Solutions (GIS) unit, including 1,000 from the unit's Dayton, Ohio,
headquarters.  Overall, GIS employs some 43,000 people in more than
120 countries.

The division's chairman described the restructuring as "painful."

"The realities of declining margins and cost-cutting across the
computer industry require us to take this step now, painful and
difficult as it is," said Lars Nyberg, chairman and CEO of AT&T GIS.
"We must dramatically reduce our costs to be competitive."

Towards that goal, the AT&T powerhouse also announced the creation of
three new companies, each to focus on a crucial market in the global
information industry.  Areas to be targeted include communications
services, communications equipment and transaction-intensive
computing, which is the main thrust of AT&T GIS.

According to the strategy, AT&T shareholders will hold stock in each
of the new companies.  A remaining business, AT&T Capital Corp., will
be sold.  AT&T stock rose almost $5 a share immediately after the
breakup was announced.

Wednesday's announcement came just four years after AT&T entered the
quickly evolving computer arena by acquiring NCR, which then form the
center of the GIS division.  And as a result of the decision to close
up shop, the company will take another financial hit.  AT&T must cough
up a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge against earnings to cover the move.
The company said the charge will be taken against third-quarter tax
earnings.  The end result: 1995 after-tax earnings will drop by around
$1 billion, or 66 cents a share.

AT&T said it will continue to offer personal computers as part of
"total solutions," but will cease manufacturing and selling its own
line.  GIS expects to announce a new PC supplier soon.

Subject: Split of Area Code 216 Announced


NORTHEAST OHIO TO HAVE THREE AREA CODES

CLEVELAND, Sept. 14 /PRNewswire/ -- Northeast Ohio will soon have not
one but three area codes as telecommunications companies add new phone
numbers to accommodate rising demand.

Under a two-stage plan announced today, the area now designated as
area code 216 will be divided next year into a northern portion that
will retain the 216 designation and a southern portion that will be
assigned area code 330.  In a second stage scheduled to take place in
1997-1998, the northern portion will be subdivided by introducing a
second new area code.

The number designation and geographic boundaries of this third
Northeast Ohio area code have not yet been determined.  Each new area
code makes possible the addition of 792 three-digit prefixes that can
be used to assign new seven-digit phone numbers.  Each area code has a
capacity of 7.8 million telephone numbers.  In its current configuration, 
the 216 area code will reach capacity next year. The area code plan
was developed by the Northeast Ohio telecommunications Industry
Planning Group, whose 19 member companies provide local, long
distance, cellular and paging services within the present 216 area
code.  The group has been working within the guidelines of the
industry's North American Numbering Plan to develop practical plans to
accommodate continuing demand for telephone numbers in Ohio's
burgeoning Northeast quadrant.

In developing its plan for Northeast Ohio, the industry group examined
several alternative proposals and consulted with the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio and with Bellcore, the New Jersey-based industry
consortium that serves as national administrator of area code
assignments.  The Northeast Ohio group also weighed results of an
extensive opinion research effort which asked consumers and
representatives of large and small businesses to evaluate several
alternative proposals.  The two-phase plan emerged from this research
as the clear choice of those surveyed.  "We have been looking for the
most practical and least disruptive way of meeting this area's needs
for expanded communications capabilities, and we think this plan meets
that challenge," said Regional Numbering Plan Administrator and
Ameritech Manager Warren Mickens.  "The companies within this industry
group will be working hard for the next several months to make the
introduction of these new area codes as smooth as possible for all
their customers," Mickens said.

To ease the transition to the new 330 area code, the industry will
launch an optional dialing period during which calls to locations
within the 330 area may be dialed using either the new 330 or the old
216 area code.  This optional transition period will begin March 9,
1996, and will continue until the new dialing pattern becomes
mandatory beginning on June 29, 1996.  Conversion to mandatory dialing
patterns will take approximately two weeks to accomplish.

Phase II is scheduled to begin in June, 1997, with the introduction of
a second new area code.  This second new code will subdivide the 216
area code designated under Phase I.  From late June 1997 through early
January 1998, calls to locations affected by Phase II will be
completed whether callers dial the 216 area code or new code yet to be
designated.  Use of the new Phase II area code is scheduled to become
mandatory beginning in January 1998.

An advisory panel comprised of Metropolitan Cleveland area civic
leaders will provide input to the Industry Planning Group in
establishing boundaries for the Phase II implementation.

Implementation of this plan will not change the cost of placing
or receiving calls.  Existing customers will retain their present
seven-digit numbers, even if their area code must change.

In opting for the two-phase, three area code plan, the industry
group considered several benefits only this plan will deliver to
consumers, governmental agencies and businesses throughout Northeast
Ohio.

These benefits include:

    -- continuation of geography-based area code designations,
    -- maintaining seven-digit calling patterns for virtually all
       local calls,
    -- each telephone number will only experience a single area code
       change,
    -- a longer-lasting plan that will keep Northeast Ohio from
       running out of phone numbers for at least 10 years.

Telecommunications companies serving Northeast Ohio will be working
over the next several months to reconfigure their networks to
accommodate new dialing patterns required by the new area codes.  The
companies advise that residential and business users of fax machines,
pagers, cellular phones, computer modems, and pre-programmed speed
dialers, telephone switchboards and security alarms will need to
reprogram their equipment and should take advantage of the scheduled
optional periods to do so.

In addition, businesses and individuals will want to consider how best
to revise advertising, stationery, signage and other items that carry
complete phone numbers whose area codes will change under the plan.

Telecommunications companies within the Northeast Ohio Industry
Planning Group are designing communications programs to inform their
customers about implementation procedures and to assist customers in
making necessary changes at the appropriate times.

The Industry Group consists of the following telecommunications
companies: Airtouch Paging, ALLTEL, Ameritech, Ameritech Paging,
Cellular One, Century Telephone, Conneaut Telephone, GTE Mobilnet, GTE
North, MCI, Nextel, Orwell Telephone Pagenet, Pattersonville
Telephone, Sprint Cellular, Sprint/United Telephone, USA Mobile,
Wallace Data, Youngstown Cellular.

%T   "What's On the Internet"
 
There should be a correction to this title.  The book is *not* about
"What's On the Internet," but rather, "What's On Usenet."  Although
some other Internet applications are mentioned (all the graphics in
the book, for example, have been "ftp"ed from Internet sites), the
central resource here is a listing, with descriptions, of 2200 of the
11,000 Usenet newsgroups available to the authors.
 
The descriptive listings are divided into chapters on the Internet,
business, politics, culture and philosophy, hobbies and travel,
Clarinet, entertainment, science and education, computers and telecom,
sports, local groups, and finishing with "Off the Wall, Singles and
Adult".  The listings contain a headline, group name, some
description, possibly some sample subject lines and files available in
the rtfm.mit.edu /pub/usenet directories.  There is an alphabetical
listing of the 11,000 newsgroups available to the authors, and a
subject index.
 
The decision as to what to include was based upon a minimum of ten
messages posted over a three-day period.  This makes for some
interesting omissions.  comp.risks, the Usenet news mirror of the
RISKS-FORUM Digest, is missing, in spite of its being universally
hailed as one of the best groups/lists on any topic.
comp.binaries.ibm.pc wanted and comp.binaries.ibm.pc.d are there--but
not comp.binaries.ibm.pc, the whole point of the exercise.  (The
newsgroup index is in error on this point.)
 
Unless the group caught the author's attention, descriptions are
limited to a single sentence, and seem to be primarily the author's
interpretation of what the group *should* talk about.  In almost every
case of a newsgroup with which I am personally familiar, the
description failed to catch the reality of the discussion.  But then,
what can you expect from someone who thinks that Bitnet is the
predecessor of Usenet news, or that the Internet Protocol (IP) is what
is used to organize and format newsgroups.  The citations to the rtfm
ftp site are helpful, but there is no explanation of the (arguably
easier) mail server.
 
There is little here to promote this work over descriptive lists such
as Gene Spafford's (sarcasm and all), or even a simple review of
newsgroup titles.  However, it may be a helpful printed reference for
those wanting a quick overview of the range of topics for Usenet news.

Subject: Warning Directory Assistance Imposter


In BKRON@NETCOM.COM's Spetmeber 19, 1995 Note-- He covered problems
with Directory Assistance (DA) service via MCI. He assumes that using
AT&T the caller is connected to Bell Operators. That is no longer the
case even with AT&T.

I've heard from reliable sources, that AT&T recently moved their
1-716-555-1212 traffic from NYNEX operators to an operator firm out in
Phoenix,AZ. All of a sudden Rochester Tel began to get complaints from
non-pub susbscribers asking why their telehpone number was being
released through DA service.

Guess what? It was not Rochester releasing them via 411 calls, but
AT&T via their 1-716-555-1212 operations. Apparently the operator
service AT&T now uses for 716-555-1212 (and their 1-900-555-1212) is
using a non-RBOC database which in part comes from credit, DMV, etc.
type records and includes normally non-pub numbers. However, people in
good faith put them on their driver or car registrations. Once these
are sold -- you are no longer non-pub.

This leads to several questions:

 1. If you contract for non-pub is with you local telephone company
and they refuse to sell/lease their database, is the alternate DA
service doing anything wrong in giving out your telephone number?

 2. As Local Telephone competition arises -- will LEC's share their
subscriber numbers with each other for 411 and directory purposes? You
must view this question from the new-LEC point of view -- if you spent
large sums of dollars to capture say 5,000 subsribers in any RBOC
territory, would your next step be to turn your success list over to
you major competition?

        A. If you think the many calls for your long distance business
is a problem -- add potential calls from LECs seeking to serve you.

        B. If you were in competition with a bunch of new-LECs wouldn't 
you desire to understand which marketing programs work to get people
to move off of your service (thus the new-LEC helps you market research 
for free giving you numbers)?

 3. If new LECs don't provide their numbers to a 411 service -- how do
you find a telephone number? Call each LEC? Years ago California had a
similar problem in the LA area between GTE and PacBell each having
about 50% market share -- they brought in a third party (Volt Delta
I think it was) to handle the directory publication to avoid the in
fighting (then just for Yellow Page advertising). DOes anyone
following the local competition trends see any PUCs looking toward
independent 411 services?

4. If local number portability takes off -- and you tell your RBOC
you're moving to the ABC LEC -- the enter a disconnect order removing
you from their DA service -- how long will it be before you get
reinserted by ABC if at all? Has anyone studied the potential impact
of portability on operator and DA services?

5. Bell Atlantic Mobile does not use Bell Atl (ROBC) DA services --
they have an alternate DA provider. Several BAM users tell me they get
poor DA service via BAM and it costs the Air time in addition to 411
costs. One friend received a large BAM usage credit after complaining
to the President abour their poor DA service (wrong three out of three
calls one day -- and couldn't find his own number which He's had over
25 years). So poor DA service is not limited to BKRON's experience
with MCI.

Lastly, AT&T and MCI have already opened markets for Alternate
Directory Assistance services via NPA-555-1212, 1-900-555-1212 and
1-800-GET-INFO.  One press article claimed a Bell Atlantic reduced
their DA operator force in the C&P region almost 20% dure to AT&T
moving their 703, 202 and 301 calls over to an outside operator
service.  Is this the start of total restructuring of the network's
Services and Support markets? If so who owns the accuracy responsiblities -- 
the FCC? They don't think so?

I have used the 1-900-GET-INFO number, and have also had bad results.
My worst experience with them was when I tried to get the number for
MCI's New York City office.  I called five times to get the correct
number before I gave up.  I got all incorrect listings.  One number
was disconnected, another rang unanswered, another was a reorder tone,
and still another was another company named MCI.  Don't forget, this
was MCI I was calling for MCI's phone number!

My experience with AT&T's 1-900-555-1212 number has been much more
positive.  The DA operator I spoke to politely asked, "What city and
state, please?"  When he found no listing for the person I was
calling, he placed me on hold "while I check further."  (I assume he
was calling telco's DA).  It turns out that I asked for the wrong
city.

I think I'd rather pay AT&T's 75 cents for accurate information instead of 
MCI's 85 cents for outdated or otherwise inaccurate information.

Be careful about AT&T also.  I understand that they are considering
"taking back" their DA because they think the RBOC's charges are too
high.  This means getting telephone listings any way they can.

The shame is that without regulatory relief the RBOC's cannot allow
interlata calls to their DA operators even if the customer has no
other way to get there.  Even the use of 800 service provided by an
IXC is forbidden.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: What there *ought* to be is a single
directory assistance standard, or method of operation. All telcos would
supply their *published, listed* numbers to a database, and all who
wished to operate a DA service could do so, drawing their information
out of that database. The use of 555-1212 would be limited to a single
organization owned by all the telcos (something in the way Bellcore is
independent but all the telcos use their services). All telcos would
be required to cooperate with this agency or organization. The fee would
be established by tariff.   PAT]

No thanks.  I like being able to dial direct digits on inside calls.
* and # are used for accessing specific functions on PBXs (like remote
call pickup and direct trunck selection) so requiring all PBXs to
change would lose the availability of these features.

Absolutly NOT.  I don't want some kid (or competitor with an attitude)
calling my phone for free from any payphone in the US/Canada however
wide you are making this.  If all I know is the city I won't know
until I pay who is calling.  And even if I refused to accept I still
get interrupted.

911 centers are going to love to get calls from citizens who have no
coins.  What is the number for 911?  911!  If you want 911 you should
dial it.

The operator option is acceptable, since they could offer transfers to
911 or a suitable authority, or accept a calling card for the call.
But then the phone would have to know not to require coins for this
connection.  I'll believe it when I see a COCOT do it!  The intercept
could be changed to add 'for help, dial 0 for an operator' as it is in
some areas.

Absolutely.  All local calls should be connected and billed as local
calls regardless of 1+, NPA+, or 7D (where permitted) pattern used.
This would help travelers more than missing children since they would
not have to reprogram their pocket dialers (or minds) every time they
changed local calling areas.

Available on a limited basis now (for prank calls mainly).  Just dial
a * something code and the number is logged.  Report the call to the
police or telephone company and they investigate (without telling you
the number).  Call-back * codes could also be used to store this
number in some switches.

Train the child to dial 911.  Universal 911 is growing and should be
the most well known way to get help.  '0' is another option in areas
where 911 does not work.  (Including switchboards with an attendant.)
My nephews all know 'if you get lost and you need help dial 911'.

If PBX administrators would make 911 (as well as 9-911) work from any
phone it would be helpful too.  Not too many people would be
attempting to reach 9-1-1xx-xxx-xxxx numbers (unless they thought they
were dialing 011 for IDDD access).

Sounds like a good list, but give them a different message, to set a
'national policy on telephone dialing' that includes OPTIONAL 1+NPA
local dialing (billed as dialed local) and suggesting 911 be permitted
along side 9-911 where the PBX can handle it.

(All comments are based on the US telephone system.)

Many PBXes are set up so that 9+11 turns into 911, since almost
nowhere does a useful number start with 11 (just some pulse
equivalents of *72 et al which are useless behind a PBX.)

Oh, wow. All coin calls time out to auto-collect? I think not. It's
easy enough to teach the kid to dial 0+number and say "collect".

This is only the case in states where short-sighted people have forced
the 1+ = toll nonsense. In New Jersey, the Land of Perfect Dialing,
this is how it's always worked, you can dial all calls with 11 digits
even within your own exchange and it handles them correctly. I believe
it's the case in most areas where you can dial all intra-NPA calls
with 7 digits.

Call Trace serves this function now. It does what caller-ID is
frequently misrepresented as doing, collecting the calling number of a
call that you need to report to the cops.

Actually this is changing -- in most areas you CAN dial 1 plus the
area code (in your own area code) and still get through.

This is also available as "Call Trace" from Pacific Bell.  Hang up,
dail the access code, and a report will be provided to the police.

As for the rest of the situation you mentioned, I see a far simpler
solution than changing the entire phone network:

Tell your child to dial "0" for Operator.  This should work
EVERYWHERE.  Payphones, homes, businesses will ring their private
operator, hotels will ring front desk, etc.  The child can say "Im
lost.  THis is my number XXX."  Don't you think it would be better for
a REAL person to handle the call instead of the possibility of the
child getting an answering machine or worse an intercept?  The
operator should be able to call emergency service if needed.

Far simpler, and probably more efficient.

When I was five, we had such a system ... we did not have 911, and we
only had 4-digit (later 5) local dialing, no DDD, no area codes ...
but we could dial (rotary) one digit...  "Dial 0 and say 'I need help'
if you ever need help," my parents told me.  And they told me when
THEY were young, you could skip the "Dial 0" step!

        What happened was something that dates back to the 1840's.
The spring-wound mechanism was probably much like that of a music box.
As the spring unwound, a wheel with notches cut in to it rotated past
a switch.  The notches were cut so that a code was sent via telegraph
wires to the central fire station.  The mechanism probably had a
governor of some kind to make sure that the speed was fairly constant
as the spring unwound.

        A book about the history of fire fighting in the United States
credits the city of Boston with having the first alarm box system in
the 1840's.  When you take in to account that the Morse telegraph
wasn't invented until the early 1840's, this was comparable to one of
today's cities installing fiber optic ATM links to all the buildings
in the downtown area.

        The officials who installed this system anticipated malicious
alarms and made one very big mistake.  They locked the alarm boxes and
left the keys to them at nearby homes or businesses so that one had to
first get somebody in one of those places to bring out the key to send
in the alarm.

        I have never been to Boston, but their fire department used
radio frequencies that sometimes propagate in to Oklahoma.  I noticed
that they had their street boxes tied directly in to the radio system
so that when somebody pulled a box, one would hear a long tone to get
everyone's attention followed by the box number pulsed out much like a
very slow rotary dial telephone.  I seem to remember that the beeps
were about three or four per second so a person could easily count
them to determine the number.

        After a couple of repeats, the human dispatcher would confirm
the box number and make sure that the correct engines were heading for
the fire.

        The alarm boxes vanished from streets in Tulsa and Oklahoma
City as well as many other places as soon as 911 became the method of
choice to report emergencies.  I also remember that many of the street
boxes had a glass window that one had to break with an attached hammer
to activate the alarm.  This always seemed dumb and dangerous to me,
but I am sure there was a good reason for it.

I work as a volunteer in the emgerency room of the Providence Rhode 
Island hospital. A family member of a patient had to contact the East 
Providence Police (a seperate city, bordering on Providence).

I looked up the number in a phone book on my desk, gave it to the
family. The husband comes back upset, saying he can't get through.
Turns out the local number for the police had been changed last year.
The recording simply stated that "the number you dial is no longer
working. See your directory for the new number."

Turns out I was using an old telephone book. But even so, I would have
thought some other message should have stated the number is now
xxx-xxxx. Or am I asking for too much in life??

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: For the past six months or so, Ameritech's
business office has been on a daytime only schedule. They used to have
people there around the clock to take calls. The monthly phone bill *still*
says 'you can reach us 24 hours per day at 800-244-4444'.  What one area
of telco is doing seldom seems to get known in other areas for a long time.

You'd think also they might have intercepted that number with a live operator
who then connected it to the proper police department, but they probably
did not think of that either.     PAT]

Subject: JSC Special Issue on Executable Temporal Logics


                The Journal of Symbolic Computation
                -----------------------------------
                [Editor-in-Chief: Bruno Buchberger]

            Special Issue on Executable Temporal Logics
      Guest Editors: Michael Fisher, Shinji Kono, Mehmet Orgun

                        Call For Papers
                        ---------------

BACKGROUND: Logical representations have been widely used in Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence. In recent years, particularly
with the advent of languages such as Prolog, the direct execution of
such representations has been shown to be both feasible and useful.
Logic-based languages have been used, not only for applications such
as the animation of logical specifications, the characterisation of
database queries and knowledge representation, but also as high-level
programming languages in their own right. However, as the problems
tackled have become more complex, the requirement for more powerful
logical representations has been growing. In particular, since the
concept of time is of central importance to an increasingly wide range
of applications, including the representation of time-dependent data
and the specification and verification of concurrent and distributed
systems, many logics incorporating temporal notions are being
developed and applied.

It is not surprising, therefore, that executable temporal logics have
been proposed in order to provide system developers with access to
these, more powerful, logical techniques. Just as the development of
sophisticated, and relatively efficient, theorem-proving techniques
for first-order logic led to executable forms, such as Prolog, so the
development of executable methods for temporal logics has often been
based on temporal theorem-proving techniques. However, each particular
executable temporal logic combines not only a logical perspective, but
also an operational model, drawn from its intended application areas.
Thus a wide range of languages have appeared, exhibiting a variety of
characteristics and execution mechanisms. Consequently, such languages
have a variety of application areas, such as temporal databases,
temporal planning, animation of temporal specifications, hardware
simulation, and distributed AI.

OBJECTIVES: The Journal of Symbolic Computation is planning a special
issue on Executable Temporal Logics, scheduled to appear in 1996.
High quality original research papers are solicited on all aspects
relating to the foundations, implementation techniques and
applications of languages based upon temporal logic. The research
described must not only incorporate an adequate level of technical
detail, but must also provide a clear indication of both the utility
and the applicability of the results. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to,

   * theoretical issues in executable temporal logics
   * design of executable temporal logics
   * relationship between execution and temporal theorem-proving
   * operational models and implementation techniques
   * programming support and environments
   * comparative studies of languages
   * relationship of executable temporal logics to (temporal) databases  
   * applications and case studies

Because of the nature of the journal, it is particularly important
that submissions, even purely theoretical ones, indicate the
algorithmic relevance and applicability of the approach.

Papers must be original and must not have been previously published or
simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere. The papers will be
reviewed based on their originality and technical quality, relevance
to the special issue theme, and the extent to which they will advance
the frontiers of knowledge in this area.

In addition to longer papers, we would welcome short papers (5 to 10
pages) describing specific features or novel applications of
executable temporal logic.

Submissions should follow the JSC style guide available from

        ftp://ftp.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/pub/jsc

LaTeX users are encouraged to use the jsc.sty file.

Electronic submission is strongly encouraged (either as self-contained

Subject: 312/773 Split


All contents copyrighted by Crain's Chicago Business September 11, 1995

IN OR OUT? THE AREA CODE PLAN: AMERITECH MAPS PROPOSED 312 / 773 SPLIT
By MARK VEVERKA

Ameritech Illinois has unveiled its much-anticipated boundary proposal
for two area code zones in Chicago.  The shrunken 312 area code in the
city center would be larger than originally announced -- peaking north
of Armitage Avenue and extending to 35th Street on the south, Western
Avenue on the west and the lakefront on the east.  Everywhere else
within the city limits would be in a new 773 area code.  The plan must
be approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission, which also is
considering an alternative that would create an "overlay" area code
for all new users in the existing 312 geographic area.  Although
Ameritech prefers an overlay, it has agreed with other telecommunications 
companies to support a dual geographic zone configuration. But because
of technological limitations, boundaries for such a configuration
would not follow straight lines, such as streets.  "That means you
have a jagged (border) that corresponds to no known geography" says
Martin Cohen, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board (CUB).
"The way the lines will run will be very confusing to those who are on
the borders."  Despite some of the plan's imperfections, Mr. Cohen's
utility watchdog group endorsed Ameritech's dual area code solution.
Originally, CUB argued that an outer ring should get the 312
designation -- because the area has more residential users, who are
the organization's primary constituency.

However, 70% of the city's businesses are in the core zone, and
preserving 312 for Chicago's commercial center, including the Loop, is
at the heart of the phone company's plan.  "Businesses incur a lot of
out-of-pocket expenses when an area code gets changed," says an
Ameritech Illinois spokeswoman.

The 773 area code would go into effect in October 1996.  "It will be
an inconvenience at first that will cost us some money to change some
forms -- but eventually, everybody will get used to it," says Steve
Larrick, chief executive of Chicago-based Chernin's Shoes, whose North
Halsted Street store would be just north of the 312 border in the 773
area.  The phone company says the area code reconfiguration should
prevent a numbers shortage beyond 2000 -- but it gave the same
assurances when it implemented the 708 area code in 1989.  "The
thinking was that (708) would last until the next century. It did
not," the Ameritech spokeswoman says.

Subject: "Discriminatory" Overlay Area Codes
Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 261-4700 guest)
Date: Thu, 21 Sep 1995 11:26:02 GMT


I was just looking through some of Steve Grandi's notes about upcoming
area code splits and overlays, and something caught my attention,
specifically in regard to the Chicago area.

The original plan was that 630 would be implemented as an overlay of 312
and 708, with all wireless services (cellphones and beepers) moving into
the new 630 area code.  The cellular providers protested that such a
move was "discriminatory on class of service" and succeeded in changing
the setup.  Their point was that the landline carriers (Ameritech and
any future competition) would have an unfair advantage by keeping 312
and 708.

The new plan is that 708 will split twice into 708, 630, and 847, and
312 will split into 312 and 773.  All fine and well, except for one
bit of fine print: cellular phones located in areas whose area code is
changing WILL NOT be required to change in the splits.

WHY?  If it is "discriminatory on class of service" to force ONLY the
wireless providers to switch to the new area code, then it is also
"discriminatory on class of service" to force EVERYONE BUT the wireless
providers to switch.

Personally, I still think that wireless overlays would've been a great
idea, much better for both wireless and landline customers than the
current mess of splits and universal overlays.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Just as with the flip-flop on 312/773,
it all depends on who you know and how well you can twist arms, etc. 
Ameritech originally said close to three million subscribers should
not have to change their area code when a small number of subscribers
in the downtown area could do so instead. The problem is, the large
businesses downtown have lawyers, and other highly placed contacts at
the state and city government level and they make a lot of noise. Why
should they have to go out and buy new letterheads and rubber stamps?
Why should they have to hire someone to reprogram their PBX equipment
who knows anything about it, etc. 

I think the aggregate cost of close to three million people having to
change *their* phone number is a lot more than a few businesses downtown
having to change theirs.    PAT]

I would like to know if anyone has any information on the upcoming PCS
service offerings in Hong Kong.

So far, I know that several PCS licenses were issued in November 1994,
but I would like to find out how long these licenses last and what are
the technical specifications of PCS in Honk Kong.

If you have any information or know of a source of information on

A few weeks ago I had posted about a problem I had getting credit for
long distance call that I had made using my modem and then getting cut
off. Our Moderator blasted me because he said I was just nickel and
diming them. Well after a few these this week working with several
AT&T Tech's out of their Denver center we found the problem. 

It seems that when you dial a call using their network in it a zero
lose/gain trunk; which means there is nothing to up the signal. Local
(PacBell) they have the local trunking set for .05db loss and it
appears that both of my phones are right at the limit. Normal voice
there is not a problem, but with the modem any noise as you all know
will cause problems. Since I have error correcting modems they will
try to keep connected. Since the phone lines are made for voice there
is not much that I can get done. I have complained about it and they
tell me to get data grade lines, that is just great except what
happens when I go into the regular network and call a system that just
has a voice line.  I guess in time it will all change since PacBell is
getting into the IP business and they will get a lot of complaints
unless they do fix the cable that is in trouble. I guess I'll just
live with it or move closer to the office so my loop is not as long.


The above are my ideas and have nothing to do with whoever my employer is.

I was going through Steve Grandi's list of area code splits (FTP from
gemini.tuc.noao.edu, /pub/grandi/npa1995.txt) and thought I would add a
summary just listing the dates that area code splits become final.  This
list only includes geographic splits, not overlays, and it only includes
those splits for which both the initial effective date and the final
(end of permissive dialing) date have been announced.  Check Steve's
file for more details.

The splits are listed in order by the date of the END of permissive
dialing.

It should be pointed out that this is not a bug, but a design flaw.
Netscape works as intended, but it doesn't use enough entropy to seed
the generator.  (Entropy is the formal measure of unpredictability.)

This attack has only been shown to work in the 40-bit version because
that's all the attackers had access to, but it has nothing to do with
the weakened RC4 and the commercial version is likely vulnerable too.

Those working with algorithms that depend on something being hard to
guess should read RFC 1750.

This may not be true; it's a common sort of bug, but the more likely
number is 2^15 or 2^16 (just as 2^31 is a number often found on
today's 32-bit machines).  When 4096 is mentioned along with Unix
passwords, it almost always refers to the novel "salting" technique
that allows each encrypted password to have 4096 possible ciphertexts.
This makes precomputed dictionary attacks harder and makes it unlikely
that two users with the same password would know it from the
ciphertexts.

I am currently contesting a billing from an ITA corporation for
'voicemail' that appeared on my Southwestern Bell bill.  SBC told me
they could refuse the billing, but that ITA would likely use a
collection agency to further pursue the billing.  I contacted ITA, and
they told me they were simply billing for a NY based corporation that
could only be reached via US Mail (I guess they don't have a phone,
fax machine, etc.).

I also refuse to pay for this, since I do not believe anyone in my
household knowingly contracted for this service.  I contacted my
Senator.  He is now in contact with the FCC.  Based on the convoluted
billing arrangements that can now exist, I don't know of any simpler
way to do this.  I'd sure like to know if someone has a better idea.

What seems to be missing in all this is that there are at least two
carriers involved in every international call.  The FCC can regulate
the US ones all it likes, but it obviously has no control over the
ones in other countries.  Non-US providers of dial-a-porn and such
will presumably continue to make suitable kickback deals with the
carrier that provides their incoming service.  The US caller will dial
as usual, the US carrier will do the settlements with the non-US
carrier as usual, and the non-US carrier will direct some of the money
to the service provider.

It seems implausible that the FCC would attempt to tell US carriers
that they may not connect to certain numbers outside the US based
either on the content of certain calls or on the (presumably confidential) 
billing arrangements between the non-US carriers and their subscribers.

I recently switched LD carriers to MCI (and I may switch to someone
else very soon, considering MCI's November discount rate change).  It
was all handled over the phone, and after I had given my information
to the MCI representative, I was transferred to an independent
verifier who asked for all my information again and checked to make
sure that I knew I was changing carriers and that the local phone
company would add a charge to my bill.  I don't remember any comments

       Your statement that 611 is a "pseudo-standard" for repair is
puzzling.  I have never lived or worked in a place where 611 was
used for repair, nor have I ever needed to call repair in a place
where 611 was used.

I thought I'd post this response to several posts about Alternative
Operator Services for DA.  Generally speaking, AT&T contracts with
RBOC's and LEC's (owners of the numbers) to provide Directory
Assistance services.  As TD readers point out, these providers
naturally have the highest degree of accuracy.  If a subscriber in
their region changes a number today, their DA database is updated
virtually instantaneously and it disallows the delivery of non-pub
numbers.  This compares to a third party service providers methods
which may not catch a number change for 30 days or more (unless of
course, they're on line to the LEC database, which most are not).  As
for comments regarding the cost of service, it is rare that a third
party can beat the cost of RBOC DA service.  In order to do so, they
usually have to cut quality.

A major hardware and/or software upgrade to every piece of phone
equipment in the U.S. that stores or processes phone numbers,
including everything from central office switches through PBXes to
memory phones. No dice.

That's why when organizations go from attendant or DISA to DID they
arrange to get an appropriately sized chunk of numbering space so that
the total length of the number remains 10 digits.

Outside North America the phone switches are set up to do incremental
routing and to pass digits on demand. But here the 3+3+4 format is
graven in a great deal of granite. Europeans sometimes sniff that they
adhere to the international ITU-T standard and we don't, but that
mostly reflects the historical situation that 40 to 50 years ago the
relatively small phone systems in Europe had to negotiate among
themselves for dial interconnection, using the CCITT (now the ITU-T)
as their forum, while here in the USA (which had at the time more
phones than the rest of the world together) AT&T came up with a design
that worked here and we've used it ever since.

There were two incidences that got brought up in a discussion during a
seminar that no one had too much information on other than they knew
about them; the 1984 Mother's Day fire at the switching center in
Hinsdale, Illinois, and the time where a software glitch brought down
AT&T's long distance network a few years ago.  Does anyone know more
of the specifics on these two incidences, i.e. the actual causes and
event sequences, what was the class of the C.O. in Hinsdale, etc?  Any
information would be appreciated.


Eric Carr
Carr-C10973@email.mot.com

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The Hinsdale disaster was May 8, 1988,
not 1984. In addition to that and the glitch you referred to, there
have been other fires and disasters. In 1990 the phones in St. Louis
went out for awhile due to a fire. In 1974-75 (?) phones were out for
a few days in New York City due to a major fire in a switching center.
By comparison, things prior to that seem almost minor, but as a note
in passing, a fire in a phone company office in one of the northwest
suburbs of Chicago in 1946 knocked out service in that (manual) exchange
for about two weeks. 

In an even earlier situation, a fire in 1939 at the Chicago Union
Stockyards destroyed a large part of the physical plant there, injuring
several workers and killing a large number of the animals although most
of the animals were led to safety. The Union Stockyards was served by
a central office on its premises called YARds, and later YArds-7.
That same central office served the surrounding neighborhood which was
and is still known as 'Back of the Yards' although the stockyards have
now been closed for many, many years and the phone exchange relocated.

Although the phone exchange itself was spared in the fire which 
involved several processing buildings around it, the only way people in
those times -- the summer of 1939 -- could stay cool was by having
windows open for what cool breezes happened to come through since air
conditioning was largely unheard of. In those days, offices just had all
their windows open and usually ceiling fans which circulated the air. 
On the day of the fire which was an extremely hot and muggy day, the
operators were choking from the thick smoke which came in and even after
closing their windows the smoke kept getting in. The exchange was put
on emergency-only service and throughout the day and into the night the
poor operators sat there coordinating telephone calls between stockyard
employees and firemen in the fire-fighting effort and answering calls from 
frantic residents of the immediate neighborhood where rumors were rampant 
that the fire had gotten out of control (for awhile it had) and was
going to consume the entire complex and surrounding homes.  When it
appeared that the phone exchange was going to catch on fire, the
operators were given permission to leave, but many said they would
remain until the last minute in order to continue calling neighborhood
residents one by one to keep them updated and to assist the fire
fighters with badly needed communications. So they sat there choking in
the smoke and operating their switchboards. Today, 55 years later, the
YARds exchange is known as 312-927; it still serves the 'Back of the
Yards' community on Chicago's mid-southwest side, around 43rd and Halsted
Streets.  Can't you see that kind of spirit today? [sad smile] ... No
matter how bad you think the old Bell System might have been, there was
a dedication to the job that is sadly lacking today.

Subject: Chicago telco disaster?
Date: 10 May 88 16:40:10 GMT

I have been trying to call an exchange in Chicago for the past two days
to no avail.  A recording states that "Due to local telephone company
problems in the area you are calling, your call cannot be completed.
Please try again later".  After a few calls to the AT&T operator and
their long distance repair number, I finally found out that an
Illinois Bell building serving the Chigago area caught fire and there
was serious damage.  I'm told that hundreds of exchanges are affected. (!!)
Calls via MCI, Sprint, etc. also came up with similar results, just
different recordings.  From what I understand, Ill. Bell is working on
the re-routing of calls through the office that burned, and service
*may* be restored by Wednesday.
 
Anyone else have any info. regarding this?  Is this similar to the
fire that hit the CO in New York City a couple years ago?  I thought
that disasters like these were preventable to a large extent by using
halon and other measures...  How can something of this degree occur
with relatively modern equipment?  Enough questions, I'm just curious..

A posting to this newsgroup would probably be most appropriate for
discussion.  Thanks for sharing!

                    Central Office Fire in Chicago
                            The Great Fire

Subject: Central Office Fire in Chicago
Date: Sun May  8 21:13:57 1988

A fire Sunday, May 8 caused severe damage at the Illinois Bell switching
center in Hinsdale, IL. Hinsdale is a western suburb of Chicago. As of
this posting (11:00 PM Central time) the entire center is off-line, and
nearly one hundred thousand subscribers in the west suburban area served
from the Hinsdale office are without phone service. There is no estimate
at this time as to when service to the affected communities will be
restored.

The Hinsdale office is also responsible for communications relating to air
traffic control between Midway and Ohare Airports in Chicago and the FAA
Center in Aurora, IL. Consequently, voice communications between control
locations which depended on landline phones has been severely disrupted.
Many airlines whose reservation systems are located in other cities also
have foreign exchange service through the Hinsdale office, and this has
been halted.

The fire was struck about an hour after it started, but damage estimates
are not yet available, nor specific plans made for the restoration of
service to the affected area.

Another update will be posted as soon as I have specifics. You can hear
more precise reports by calling the internal employee newsline at the
General Headquarters Building --
           The Illinois Bell Communicator - 312-368-8000

Calls to the affected area at the present time are being intercepted with
a recording 'all circuits are busy now'.

Subject: The Great Fire
Date: Mon May  9 23:19:29 1988

In my earlier posting, details were very sparce and I was unable to be
specific in describing the disaster which struck us here over the weekend.
I now have a more detailed accounting for the net --

An extra alarm fire broke out Sunday, May 8 at 5:30 PM in the Illinois Bell
Central Office, 120 North Lincoln Avenue, Hinsdale, Illinois. At the time
of the fire, the Chicago area, and the west suburbs in particular, were
experiencing a very bad electrical storm. There had been a great deal of
lightning; rain was quite heavy, and winds were about 40 miles per hour.

Fire Departments from 15 nearby communities battled the blaze before bringing
it under control at about 8:30 PM. The fire was officially struck at 11:30 PM
Sunday night. Deemed the worst disaster in the history of Illinois Bell, and
one of the worst disasters ever in the telephone industry, the fire virtually
gutted the two story building.

The Hinsdale central office is a *major* switching center for the west
suburban area. In addition to serving ten prefixes covering various
communities including Oak Brook, Westmont, Darien, Hinsdale and others,
the office housed the Directory Assistance Data Base for downstate Illinois;
it served as the communications apex for air traffic control between Ohare,
Midway, and the Aurora, IL aviation center; it was the headquarters for a
majority of the cellular phone service in the greater Chicago area; *and*
it handled long distance calls in and out of most of Dupage County, Will
County and southern Cook County.

        *And the office is now almost gutted*

The reason for the fire has not been detirmined, but fire department officials
have reason to believe the building was struck by a tremendous bolt of
lightning during the worst of the electrical storm which was in progress when
the first fire alarms were called in at 5:30 PM.

The fire caused another problem: the emission of toxic fumes which required
the evacuation of several blocks of homes in the vicinity. These fumes came
from batteries described as 'highly toxic' which were stored in the premises
and a large amount of fiber optic cable. The Hinsdale office was very much
a fiber optic center in the area.

Because of the toxic release, at one point firemen working in the building
had to be called out, in the interest of their own safety, and as firemen
relieved each other working inside in ten to fifteen minute shifts, they
were required to strip to their underwear and be hosed down with a special
solution so that the contamination would not be carried elsewhere.

After the fire was first reported, Illinois Bell employees on duty at the
time followed company procedures by first notifying the Fire Department.
Others then began fighting the fire, and a few began a process known as
an emergency telephone tree, calling other employees and company management
at home to notify them of the circumstances. Each employee thus notified
was responsible for calling a few more employees.

Within about an hour, while the fire was raging at its worst, several dozen
employees had already gathered on location, waiting for a go ahead to begin
clean up and restoration work.

   *But no one dreamed it would be nearly as bad as it was*

Although the fire was struck at 11:30 PM, fire officials would not permit
anyone to enter the building for several more hours, pending exhaustion of
the toxic fumes. Illinois Bell employees were allowed access to the building
beginning at 4:00 AM to survey the damage.

Most of Monday was spent merely bailing out the water and removing the
rubble from the fire. Emergency lighting was installed and cleaning crews
began scrubbing soot from the walls, ceilings and floors. The cleanup was
still in progress late Monday afternoon.

At this writing (12:50 AM Tuesday, May 10), Illinois Bell has not announced
any date that service will be restored. It is estimated that it will be
at least 4-5 days before *emergency* service is restored. Hinsdale, you
see, is also the main center for 911 services in over a dozen west suburban
communities.

Ordinarily in circumstances like this, the phone company will set up special
phones in public areas. They will often times be mobile or cellular type
instruments available for the public to use for emergency calls. But since
Hinsdale *is* the cellular center for Chicago, even this option is not
available.

When the first firemen arrived on the scene, heavy black smoke was pouring
out of all the windows on the first floor. By that time, employees were
evacuating after having given up on their own emergency proceedures.

What we are faced with now is a *major* traffic jam on the network in the
Chicago area. Long distance calls in and out of the area are very sluggish
in getting through. Directory Enquiry in downstate Illinois is only able
to handle about ten percent of the calls they are receiving, those being
requests that are being searched manually through paper directories on hand
in the communities affected.

Hinsdale was the major center for MCI/Sprint long distance also....and those
services are severely crippled in the area. Obviously, data transmission
lines and the like are dead.

About 40,000 subscribers, representing 100,000 residents are without phone
service for the indefinite future. In Hinsdale and the other communities
affected, the Police Departments have stationed patrol cars a few blocks
apart on the street, and residents have been told to go to the nearest
police car to report emergencies.

Illinois Bell has not announced -- as of Monday evening -- any schedule
of priorities for restoration of service. Jim Eibel, vice president of
operations for Illinois Bell said emergency phones would be set up within
a day or two, when crews were able to reroute at least limited traffic
through the LaGrange, IL center. Of equal importance of course is the
restoration of 911 service, and the restoration of long distance service.
Eibel said restoring service to the ten prefixes in the area, which would
return regular phone service to local residents would probably not occur
for 'several' days. Naturally, cellular service also has to be placed in
the table of priorities somewhere. About fifty percent of the cellular
service in the entire Chicago area is out right now due to the fire.

Other Bell companies around the nation have responded by dispatching
emergency crews to come to the aid of Illinois Bell, and these out of
town crews will remain on site for several weeks as needed. In addition,
while the fire was in progress, executives from MCI and Sprint met with
their counterparts from Illinois Bell on location and immediatly offered
their full assistance and cooperation during the period of turmoil we
will be facing for the next several weeks.

For up to the minute announcements during the next several days, it is
recommended that you call a special recorded announcement service for
company employees. Called the 'Illinois Bell Communicator', this recorded
announcement will be updated 4-5 times daily, and can be recieved by
dialing 312-368-8000, a number at IBT Chicago Headquarters Building.

It goes without saying on this forum that everyone is requested to
avoid making all but emergency calls into the Chicago west suburban area
for at least the next several days. And if your call is met with an
'all circuits busy' message, kindly refrain from repeated dialing attempts,
as this simply clogs the network even worse.

A further update will be posted here when I have news available.

The last fire to occur in a telephone center was in Manhattan a few years
ago. You may recall the resulting damage and confusion from that situation.
The last fire *in the Chicago area* occurred in the River Grove, IL central
office in 1946...then an all manual exchange. Unlike that fire, considered
bad at the time, the fire in Hinsdale this past weekend was many times worse,
since Hinsdale is responsible not only for its local calling area but so
many of the overall network services for the Chicago area.

From: Patrick_A_Townson@cup.portal.com
Subject: Hinsdale - Wednesday night update
Date: Wed May 11 17:14:34 1988

The cleanup and service restoration goes on, slowly it seems, yet an overview
shows tremendous progress at the Illinois Bell Hinsdale Central Office, in
the wake of the disasterous fire Sunday night which gutted what IBT has
termed 'one of the four super centers in the Chicago area'. Bell officials
have still given no date for the complete restoration of service. The closest
estimate is 'several days - perhaps another week'.

Wednesday brought these accomplishments --

Five additional emergency telephone centers were installed in various areas.
In addition to the center located outside the burned out building at 120 N.
Lincoln Street, the huge communication trailers have been moved into shopping
malls and near the City Hall. These centers are operating and attended 24
hours per day. Calls are placed free of charge for anyone with urgent business.
The calls are limited to a few minutes and two calls per person. The users
are then requested to go to the back of the line(s) and wait their turn
again. The one center open on Tuesday was literally swamped for hours with
hundreds of people waiting in several lines, snaking their way forward to
the phones. Illinois Bell attendants rushed around taking notes and helping
the customers establish connections. The five additional centers opened on
Wednesday should relieve the crowding.

Moving vans and trailer trucks blocked Lincoln for several blocks Tuesday
night and Wednesday. Each contained new equipment and supplies for the office
which is literally being built from scratch. As a truck was unloaded, another
vehicle moved up into its place. Two Greyound busses were parked nearby,
serving as places for employees to eat, rest and clean up between work shifts.

I was amazed to see a virtual ant-hill like atmosphere when passing by earlier
today. Dozens of people were busy at their assigned tasks. Some were painting
and cleaning. Others were installing lighting, air conditioning and such.
Carpenters were working to intall doors and windows. Several people were
working with circuit boards, assembly line fashion, passing them along to
others.

The main switch, which they had hoped to save, now looks like it will have
to be replaced -- if not in its entirety, then with virtually one hundred
percent new components. The corrosion and rust from the high humidity level
of Sunday night and Monday are very evident.

The work is going on 24 hours per day. Workers take breaks when they must.
When they quit after several hours, others who had been eating/sleeping in
the Greyhound busses take their places.

Directory Assistance has been restored for everyone except in the immediate
area. The data base was rerouted through another central office. Microwave
dishes have been installed and are being used by the hospitals, police and
fire departments in the troubled area. Although residents still have no
phone service and must go out into the street to locate police help,
the police are now able to communicate among themselves, as are the
hospitals.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, Illinois Bell employees visited schools and
shopping malls throghout the area. School children were given notices to
take to their parents giving the locations of the emergency communication
centers.

     *Do Bell employees have dedication to their calling?*

I would say so... the internal newsline for employees (Illinois Bell
Communicator 312-368-8000) on Wednesday asked that, 'employees not specifically
assigned to restoration should *NOT* come to the site to assist. The limited
working space was already overcrowded with people, working in some cases
only 2-3 feet apart from each other at their tasks.

Yet show up they did, by the hundreds if it was otherwise their day off
Tuesday or Wednesday. Some came after their regular work was done; some
to assist in the public communications centers; others to man the
rest/feeding busses.

How badly has the fire hurt folks?

Hardest hit are not the teenagers of the village of Hinsdale, as they
would claim (smile), but the businesses which relied heavily on data services.
400 agents of the Illinois State Lottery are off line....
Several dozen ATM's serving the banks are off line....
Two major telemarking firms have closed 'for the duration', idleing several
hundred employees....
Stock and Option guys are tearing their hair out.....
Radio Shack reports that several hundred cellular units have been sold in
the past two days...units that function on channels assigned to Bell's
competitor and are in service....

I'll have more news for you tomorrow, and will continue to provide updates
until the crisis has passed.

Date: Thu May 12 18:12:59 1988

Life goes on....

Jim Eibel, Vice President Operations for Illinois Bell announced a restoration
schedule for Hinsdale at a press conference on Thursday. While the news was
not pleasant, it probably is realistic. Until now, IBT had responded to
inquiries about service restoration by saying, 'in a few days'.

The switch has been abandoned. Due to extensive corrosion from the water
damage the night of the fire, the switch cannot be salvaged. Replacement will
take 10-14 days of technicians working around the clock. Residents of Hinsdale,
Clarendon Hills, Darien and Oak Brook who have no service should not expect
to have service restored until *near the end of the month*.  About 35,000
subscribers, representing a population of 100,000 people in those communities
will continue to use the emergency communication trailers set up about town
until further notice.

Most emergency requirements in the area have been met by rerouting through
the LaGrange, IL center. Emergency service for hospitals, police and fire
agencies and certain other government agencies is in place now, or will be
by the evening of May 15.

The long distance toll center operation at Hinsdale has been rerouted to
other centers for the most part, and residents of the several south suburban
communities who have been only able to make strictly local calls for the past
week will have their full service restored by May 15, albeit under somewhat
cramped network facilities.

Pagers, beepers, cellular service and similar functions are largely restored
and the restoration will be complete by the evening of May 15. Again, some
network congestion is to be expected for at least a couple weeks until the
Hinsdale office is fully operational once again.

WAS THE DAMAGE INTENSIFIED BY IMPROPER EMERGENCY HANDLING?

The [Chicago Sun Times] for Thursday, May 12 reported an interview with an
'unnamed executive of Bell' who gave a somewhat different accounting of the
tragic events last Sunday.

According to this source, the fire was first noted in Springfield, IL, when
an emergency alarm was automatically tripped by the Hinsdale office. This
was about 4:30 PM. A human being in Springfield called the duty supervisor
for Hinsdale to ask what was going on. According to the newspaper report,
by the time office personnell got around to calling the Fire Department,
*the lines had already burned out* -- making the call impossible. A supervisor
stuck his head out the door at a minute or two before 5 PM and told a passer
by to please go to the Fire Department immediatly. Apparently the person did
not do so. Finally someone -- as yet unknown or unnamed -- went to the police
station in Hinsdale to report the fire at about 5:15 PM...by that time, the
phones throughout the area had already been dead for half an hour. If this
report is true, then there need to be some very serious discussions at
corporate level to find out why local employees discovered the fire *after*
someone downstate manning a computer terminal, and why it took another 45
minutes for someone to go to the Fire Department personally if necessary,
to rouse the firemen.

Bell executives would not comment on the [Sun Times] report.

For most intents and purposes then, the word is that network services for
the greater Chicago area will be restored in total by Sunday evening. Local
residents will be brought up gradually over the next 10-14 days as the new
switch is installed.

Updates can be heard on the Illinois Bell Communicator: 312-368-8000

Well, we're on the outside of Chicago, and luckily a good ways from the hub
that burned.  Illinois Bell's central office facilities in Hinsdale were
nearly destroyed by fire May 8th.

The building was gutted, all the equipment (read: the switch) is being 
replaced.  They are currently re-wiring the building, top to bottom, and 
have stated that 30,000 of the 35,000 lines that were completely off the 
air now have a dialtone -- sometimes.  IBT also openly admits that service 
will be spotty and horrid in general for some time (probably mid-June).

The fire's exact cause is still undetermined, but it is believed that it
started in one of the racks on the lower floor.  In any event, it was 
over an *hour* from the time the first alarm was seen in Springfield's
monitoring station until fire equipment arrived on the scene!  The fire
alarm was not locally connected, there was no halon or sprinkler system, and
phones were already out by the time someone tried to call it in from the
local area (about 20-30 minutes after the first indication of a problem).

Our first indication that something was wrong was when we went to complete
a wiring job on that Sunday AM and found that the cellular phones didn't
work -- all throughout the city.  The real fun and games began Monday, when
we tried to contact some of our business customers -- and got nowhere.

The situation is not nearly back to normal yet -- several of our clients still
cannot dial or receive long distance calls, our service here (50 miles away)
is spotty as well.  It's very common to redial a call a dozen or more times
before it goes through; the remaining capacity is badly overloaded.

Today things seem better -- for the first time since the fire we got a
normal news feed, a good sign that our computers (and humans) can once again
reach each other by phone.  It also seems a little better -- calls that were
a "no chance" attempt a few days ago now go through after a half-dozen tries
or so.... And my car-phone is working properly again.

There are a few questions I want to ask of Illinois Bell:

1) Why was that building, which is (obviously) extremely important to the
   integrity of the network:
        a) Un-manned (a single person would have prevented this)
        b) Not have a fire alarm connected with local fire departments
        c) Have no fire-suppression system installed (yeah, Halon is
           expensive.  How expensive is something like *this*?)

2) Who's going to pay for this obvious negligence.  We the customers?

3) What is IBT going to do to *prevent* future occurrances?

I believe that IBT should be forced to bear, without passing through, the
cost of this disaster.  As with other businesses who make mistakes, they
should have to pay out of their own pockets (and/or insurance, if there was
any -- somehow I doubt that there was considering that they didn't even
bother with a local fire alarm!)

When I moved to Chicago about three years ago, it took IBT three weeks
to get two residential lines correctly installed.  My phone would ring and
no one would be on the other end -- and calls to my number would ring
someone else's phone!  IBT failed to make good on their "will be working by
xxx" time at least a half-dozen times -- and when the phone finally did ring, 
my custom calling features were missing.  Two more weeks elapsed before those 
worked, and even then the "*70" disable for call waiting was inoperative
(this they told me they *couldnt* fix).  That little episode left me with 
a strong feeling that IBT was incapable of performing their job with 
competence.  This fiasco leaves no room for doubt.

Ps: To all of the IBT employees who are working right now to restore
    to normalcy the phones in Chicagoland -- a big thanks.  I have a few
    more choice words for IBT management, but those I will keep to myself.

myself from  Portal Communications. As a resident in Chicago, I was
affected first hand by the fire, although my personal service was not
disrupted.

As a point of information, on May 18, 1989 (Thursday), phones in the
same area were down for four hours, from 9:30 AM until 1:40 PM due to
some unidentified failure in the computer in that phone office.

Most of this has been dealt with by people pointing out that compelled

One point remains to be covered, however:

This is absolutely not true in North America.  One of the fundamental
principles of the NANP long distance network from the earliest days is
that of Destination Code Routing.  Each switch in the network is
capable of doing a database lookup on (typically) six digits of the
phone number to determine the action to take to advance the call.  The
individual digits of the number in no way specify the route the call
is to take through the network; this is a decision made by each switch
as needed, and is based on much more than the digits in the number.
Currently available trunks, congestion, previous routing history, and
many other factors can be taken into consideration to make routing
decisions.

I say "database lookup" advisedly: in the early days the database
consisted of plastic cards read mechanically, and database updates
were made by manually punching new cards.  These days, of course,
the database is more what we think of when we use that word in a
computer context: tables in memory or on disk.

The relationship between the digits in a phone number and the routing
of a call to that number is weakening even further.  Right now, there
is no connection at all between the digits of an 800 number and its
routing - the entire ten digits are looked up in a database and only
then are routing decisions made.  As local competition increases, this
will be true of all calls - even local ones.

Tying the routing of a call to the digits in the number is the
huge failing of SxS switching systems.

Easy yes -- but a disaster for planning and orderly growth.  This sort
of design ensures that Germany will not have portable numbers for a
long time.

Okay -- you are in Germany and you start to dial +1 40 ...
Now with your scheme, the local switch would have to pick up a trunk to
somewhere -- to where ?  It isn't even known what country you are calling
yet!  Then you dial 3 as the next digit, and the switch in Germany knows
you are calling Canada rather than the USA.  But Germany has trunks to
at least two points in the area covered by area code 403 - which one should
it pick up ?  The next digit is 9, but still nothing is known - it could
be somewhere near Calgary, or over a thousand miles north in the Northwest
Territories. Only after two more digits (say 79) is it finally known
what local area the called line is in.

Our rep from MCSI was talking about this with me not too long ago.
She said that one of the carriers in Las Vegas (A or B -- can't
remember) had a really low basic rate with a pretty steep per min
rate.  People from outside Vegas were doing exactly what you described
in order to have a phone for emergencies for something like
9.95/month.  And I think 911 calls are free of airtime charges to
roamers on most/all systems, aren't they?

But -- the reason we were discussing it was because some of our
personnel were having roaming trouble.  She was telling me about other
people doing the Vegas thing and having trouble when they went to use
the phone for the first time.  Seemed that if your phone was never
used on the "home" system, it may look invalid and not be able to
roam.

I suspect this is Bell's propaganda to its employees.  A recent issue

Canada which were expected to do well and were holding their own,
while Unitel and a few others were in quite a bind.

Bob Deward in an earlier posting defends Pacific Bell's policies on
payphone removal.  In my own comments, I indicated that a California
bill to curtail payphone removal, primarily in inner-city
neighborhoods but anywhere where subscriptions were lower than the
average, was watered down by telephone company lobbyists to a law
requiring merely two weeks notice before a payphone was removed.  I
stand by my account.  I did not identify Pacific Bell as a major
antagonist in this effort, but if Bob wants to assume the mantle, so
be it.  I never heard mention one by any telephone company lobbyist
regarding drug use or civic order as a rationale for removing a
payphone; it was always due to economic reasons, at least during the
passage of the law we are discussing.

Two experiences along these lines, one of them second-hand.

Steve Bunning (bunning@acec.com) wrote:

An understatement!  Mine was near Lake Tahoe, California.  In my case,
10288 was blocked, so I called the operator and asked how to get to an
AT&T operator.  "Is there any way I could place the call for you?"  I
didn't say "hell, no", just "No."  The number she gave me was 1-800-321-
0288, which worked fine.  Now, the other part of the experience: I
normally use a callback service from here (in Japan), wherein I call a
number in the US and hang up as soon as it starts to ring.  The
service calls me back and presents me with a US dial tone, and I can
talk anywhere in the US for about 55 cents/minute 24 hours a day.
This 55 cents is the Japan rate; intra-US it's even cheaper.  So I
used my AT&T access to call my callback service to inform it of the
new number -- but once the call was completed, any attempted tones
from the touch-pad resulted in a disconnect!

> [TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Wouldn't it have been easier to just unplug

A fascinating idea. Is it a foregone conclusion that the dialer had to
be on the premises?  In the rental house we used, there was a locked closet
for which we weren't given the key. Could that have been the location
of the mystery dialer?  Maybe if we had cut off the main breaker, the
dialer would have automagically just become a straight-thru connect to
the local phone company?  I wonder.

The second experience, which is second hand:  a friend of mine lives
in a "company dorm" here in Japan.  The telephone "service" there is
also very interesting.  All phone calls go thru Axxx telephone service,
which charges more for long-distance calls than NTT or KDD do.  This
is absolutely astonishing.  Anyway, use of the touch-pad after a call
is completed results in the call's being disconnected!!  This prevents
use of some call-back services, as well as preventing employees from
using the company's voice-mail system.  

Making use of a particular rip-off telecom carrier a condition of
rental is probably illegal in the US, but here in Japan I believe it
to be a not uncommon practice.  The goverment's official position seems 
to have nothing to do with consumer welfare here, which as an American
I find a little annoying.

My personal two yen's worth, and absolutely not a statement of my employer.

Are you obligated (legally) to pay for services or products foisted upon
you, that you did not order or contact for?

Might the answer to slamming, simply be to refuse to pay any bills issued,
and when the company makes an attempt to collect the debt, sue/counter-sue
them for violate of your state's consumer protection statute?

All the time you keep using their service, until they (at no charge to you)
put things back the way they were. After you receive your first bill for
their bogus service, reply with a certified letter that you did not order
nor contact the services, you will not pay for them, and they are liable
to you for damages under your state's consumer protection act.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The thing is you did 'order and contract
for the service'. Your dialing of the telephone served as your instructions.
Your local telco routed it via an incorrect vendor based on their most-
likely good faith misunderstanding of your intentions based on what they
were told by the intruding carrier.  And when you say 'all the time you
keep using their service until they put things back as they were' you 
are going to have a problem there also. You have a legal obligation to
mitigate the losses which result in any dispute. If you continue to use
their service knowing that you do not intend to pay and knowing that 
the carrier did not willfully (that is, with their knowledge) extend
their services to you in a bonafide customer relationship then you are
guilty of unlawful enrichment; that is, taking advantage of someone
else's mistake, which under the law, you may not do. 

Now if you can *prove* that the carrier change was done willfully with
an intent to defraud by the carrier which did it, you then of course
can sue them for tampering with your phone service, but if it was an
error then you have the responsibility to call attention to the error
but *not abuse it*.  You do have pay (assuming it was an error and
not willful) the carrier the amount you would have paid to the carrier
of your choice; after all you did purchase communication services. You
certainly do not have to pay any administration fee to your local telco
for the error regards getting your line changed back again. But I would
take care about continuing to use the wrong carrier expecting not to
have to pay for any of it.    PAT]

AOL probably does nothing at this point. Here's why:

AOL's "Terms of Service" instructions say that when you get offensive or
"violating" e-mail from somebody, you should forward (not copy and paste)
the message to the TOS police. Why? Because the AOL software forwards a
message *without* letting the user edit it first. You can only forward an
unchanged, original message. If the AOL cops receive a copied-and-pasted
message, they say they won't act on it because it's not an original and
could have been edited.

This is a responsible way to work. Your scenario -- blowing an innocent 
e-mail out of proportion and getting some poor person put under surveillance 
-- can't happen as described. It would take a real message, not an
imagined one, for AOL to take action (if you believe they follow their
own rules).

While I appreciate your paranoia and would never suggest that you give it
up, AOL has still not shown any indication of having read private e-mail
without the consent of either sender (unlikely) or recipient. They're as
secure as, say, mail over the Internet or CompuServe ... which is to say,
no more secure than a postcard.

Even today many fire alarm pull handles have a glass strip or other
device that doesn't automatically reset itself.  It's to ensure that
misuse can be punished: there can be no excuses like "I was just
looking at it to see how it worked, and I accidently set it off".  You
have to take a very positive action to give the alarm.  It (the
dangling handle and/or broken glass) also makes it obvious to the
repair/inspection people that the unit has been set off and needs
work.

Toronto lost its pole-mounted fire alarm boxes as recently as 1980,
as I remember.  There are still a few poles with strips of red paint
around them to be found.  One point that has perhaps not been made
clear is the reason these boxes had clockwork code senders in the
first place: they were all connected in parallel on the same wire.
(Well, there were subsets, of course, but typically all the boxes
that rang in one station were on one line.)  If each box had had a
direct wire back to the station there would have been no need for
pulses and clockwork.  As I remember, the wires on the Toronto
poles were very thick -- perhaps 10 gauge or thicker.  These wires
were strung on the municipally owned Hydro (electric power) poles
and not on telephone poles.  I have no idea what voltage was used.

Here in US Worst territory, I get the new phone book in November. The
area code map info is (apparently) "set" for when preparing the books
for folks in areas that get their books in January, and NOT UPDATED for
the rest of the year as they crank out books for other areas. 

Either that, or they just don't bother checking the info all the time ...

The books that arrived in November 94, (deadline for number changes
making it into the book is early August) shows only the 3334 and 360
splits. That's better than the year before, which only showed the 210,
905 and 909 splits (in other words, it showed as *upcoming* the splits
that took place *before* the book ever arrived, and *none* of the ones
that took place in the rest of the year!)

When we get to the NXX tables for the NPAs in our area, there are large
gaps. Thankfully, when the 541 code goes into effect for the rest of
the state that'll leave 503 covering the area where the exchange list
is more accurate. 

And the four different places that list the *local* exchanges don't
agree with each other! They are also usually *several* years behind.

Actually a "V.34bis" is NOT in the works ... however an Annex to V.34
is being planned.  It will be discussed next month in Munich at the
SG14 Working Party meeting and will come before SG14 in March in
Geneva.  If all goes well it could be officially part of V.34 around
June of 1996.  Higher speeds are one of the items being considered for

Currently, all rates above 28.8 are proprietary. See above for ITU

No standard so far. ITU-T Study Group XIV is working on an annex to
V.34. AT&T has proposed extensions covering:

- 1664 point constellation;
- encoding 10 bits per symbol instead of 9 (or 8);
- Each of the symbol rates (except 2400) can have one notch up
  for it's highest data rate;

(Summary courtesy of Stephen "kiwin" Palm from Rockwell.)

The revised V.34 specification should be adopted in spring '96, if
everything works according to plan.

Currently, AT&T (Comsphere 38x0+) and USRobotics (Courier) have
implementations of what they call "V.34+".

Yes, there is special conditioning (not necessary but best for
performance) command interpretation and signal re-routing to adapt
tip/ring to the analog cell phone connector. Remember that a cell
phone with an RJ11 input is a rare if not never existent bird indeed.
RJ11 doesn't mean anything to a cellphone. For obvious reasons.

No. That connector on Nokia is control lines and analog tx/rx lines. 
Nothing at all like tip/ring. Proprietary interface.

Doubt it. In fact no. Not until the cell carrier installs modem pools
that have protocol/signal conditioning that exactly matches what your
cell modem would have. Hopefully MNP10EC (shameless Rockwell plug).

You probably won't get better than 14.4 if you're lucky.

Assuming that you are not using all 24 DS0s, this would be an
excellent way of gaining internet access. However, this will depend on
who your carrier is for the T1 and who you are planning to use for
your Internet Access Provider. This will require that your CSU is
capable of providing Drop and Insert capability and that it can
support a DSU. Basically a DSU/CSU with Drop and Insert capability.

Subject: Re: What is Required to Switch LD Service


This is to reply to Larry Rubin on what evidence is required to switch
LD service.

In response to the question of "what is evidence is required" to
switch long distance service.  Currently there are only three ways
your service can legally be switched by you personally, calling into
the local phone company, via third party verification, or a signed
letter of authorization.  If you are solicited by a telesales person
and make a switch it is required by law that you receive a second call
from an independent third party to verify the sale. Usually the third
party call will consist of a very short script, did you know you were
switching, do you know of all the fees, here are the services you
agreed to, and is this address correct.  A signed LOA is usually
required for large line (50+) transactions, special circumstances, or
if it is requested.  If you are uncomfortable with the commitment over
the phone insist on an LOA. If the company that you are dealing with
resists or says that it is not possible I would relook my commitment.

I am concerned with the encyclopedia salesman analogy.  I do admit the
influx of new LD companies has created a concern (in some cases well
founded) for "slamming".

I am the Business Manager for a telesales center with MCI. We go to
great lengths to insure against unethical sales.  Each of our
associates receives four weeks of training before they are allowed to
start on the sales floor. The last two weeks of this is in a
specialized training bay. Once on the floor they receive an additional
two hours of training every two weeks.  We also have two organizations
that blind monitor live calls to insure quality. Each sale is verified
thru an independent company via a second call or signed LOA each of
which can cancel the sale before it effects your service. I hope that
I have made some headway in dispelling the "encyclopedia salesman"
image.  We are a professional sales organization that takes pride in
our company and products.

Organization: America Online, Inc. (1-800-827-6364)


This is very similar to sa service started in the Mississippi service
area of BellSOuth on July 31. All phone jacks now have the "soft" dial
tone -- with only two numbers allowed: 6-1-1 (customer service) and
9-1-1 (emergency).

As a 9-1-1 dispatcher, I think it's a great thing -- we only have two
small problems with it: (1) the line shows up on the ALI (Automated
Location Indicator) as a business number, which can be misleading to
someone not familiar with an area, or in an area that's mixed
business/residential. (2) the number, although it displays for us,
cannot accept incoming calls. therefore we can't call back if
disconnected. Also, the caller, obviously, won't know the number.

I would prefer to see an indicator (such as NOPR for Non-operative),
in place of the BUSN (Business) designation for these numbers. We
should also have some sort of Operator-override available (as I
believe we should on pay phones that don't accept incoming calls). By
this, I mean we could call the "0" operator, identify ourselves, and
have the operator ring the number back on disconnect. (This is the
same procedure we use for emergency traces when people call on an
administrative line and can't tell us where they are, and their
condition is too bad to trust that they can reconnect through 9-1-1 --
a process which can take up to ten minutes if they don't know the
number they're at.)


Best,

Scott


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The problem is, even the operator cannot
ringback to lines which are one-way outgoing only service *unless she
had the call up to start with and has not released it*. Just 'cold dialing'
by the operator into a one-way outgoing line will get her the same results
it gets you: an intercept saying it cannot be reached.  Now if she got the
call to start with and has not yet released it, then she can ring back
on the line. What 911 needs obviously is the ability to hold up a trunk
on an incoming call and only release it when they get ready to do so.  PAT]

I've heard that the reason companies are moving away from 611 is that
the RBOC's use it and the competitive access providers have to use a
seven digit number, so as a CAP comes into place the RBOC is ordered
to switch to a seven digit number so they don't have a saleable
advantage.

the others could not exist at all. I wonder how come the next time these
come-latelys protest about something telco is doing that is an unfair
advantage telco does not tell them (a) to start stringing their own
wires and (b) to move out of the central offices where they are co-located
and start building their own facilities. If I were operating a telco and
got the static and grief from some of the competitors that Bell gets, 
I would tell them invest in your own outside plant, construct your own
central offices, stay out of my hundred year's or so worth of research
and technology and do your own instead. Then, in thirty or forty years --
if you are lucky and all goes smoothly -- come back and see me. I will
hand you some wire pairs out the door to be used for your interconnections
and that is it.  None of those people care one iota about the consumer
or end user. They just want a piece of the action no matter what the
ultimate cost to the industry and the public network as a whole.   PAT]

I don't think this is all that new.  Pacific Bell has been doing
something similar for at least five years: although no dial tone is
provided.  Basically when someone disconnects service, PacBell
instructs the switch to disallow service -- however they don't actually
pull the circuit.  They do this for the primary line, however if there
are multiple lines in a residence, they will physically disconnect them
to re-use for other customers.

Since the line is physically connected to the switch, it would be nice
if they did provide soft dialtone so that a new customer wouldn't have
to find a payphone to establish service.

Subject: 911 From Unsubscribed Lines: Bell Canada Limits to Two Monhts?


In the article describing Bell Canada's introduction of soft dialtone on
unsubscribed lines, it was stated:

> regular phone service during September and October.

Can Bell Canada really be so cavalier to only provide 911 service for
two months?

I rented an apartment in Westchester County, NY (914) for a few
months.  Plugging in the phone I brought with me, I discovered dial
tone!  Trying to dial out ANY number except 911 and the business
office number, I reached an intercept saying that only calls to 911
and XXX-XXXX, the business office number could be made from this
phone.  The phone would NOT let me make credit card calls, all 800
nums and access codes got me the same intercept.  911 was always
available, though, not just for the first two months I was in the
apartment!

If the report on Bell Canada is accurate, I have to wonder why they
will take 911 only during September and October.  What will the
intercept to 911 say after October?  "You should have subscribed and
paid us.  Now you can be robbed and killed for all we care, cheapskate
non-cutomer!  If you do survive, call our business office to subscribe."

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I don't think telco is required to provide
its services for free on an unlimited basis. Where would you draw the
line? What about the other utility services which cut off service for
non-payment and then some emergency occurs as a result?  There are laws
here in Illinois that prevent gas/electric shutoffs during winter months
or at any time when 'a medical condition would be aggravated by the
loss of service', and telco here is obligated to follow the latter also.
But even then, it is not unlimited in scope. If your medical condition
would worsen as a result of not having a phone to call your doctor, then
you supply proof of same to telco and they keep your service on for
sixty days. But I think sixty days is more than fair.   PAT]

Pat, bonjour:

I receive today _Telecom Digest_ v15 #386 and will be please to react
from my poor little country France. We have an uncredible terminal
called Minitel with more than 32,000 services that work very good: you
can reserve train tickets, look the weather, found a parent address,
etc. for no money ...

The poor Paris's headquarters of CompuServe give all the students the
opportunity to have an expensive Internet access (with a crazy Spry
viewer), a poor file transfer system and some very easy-to-use forums.
I am the sysop of the french forum (GO FRFORUM). It's a marvelous
place, but only for strange guys sending ten-words-long messages in a
poor French language ("Ou est la Tour Eiffel a Paris?").  CompuServe
is a great company for poor member without culture.

If you look at the group conversation, the level is the same that in a
teenagers classroom. On the 500 hours of daily connection, I note
that 95% of the users are French lovers ... and no typical French guys.

AOL try to visit all the French company to found a real French market.
They send two uncredible crazy guys ... speaking a bad French language
to explain what email really is.  No sex, no ads ... nothing. A French
relation without sex, sun and sea ... is like a day without woman for
me.

Please said to CompuServe and AOL to go out from France with all the
pudibond forums ... and don't visit my forum (FRFORUM) in which only
no-French guys speak on "un-sexual" and "un-interessant" matter.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I did not edit the above because I am
not quite sure in all respects what the writer is saying or meant to
say. I can tell you that Compuserve has a huge number of European
subscribers and a large number of subscribers from all over the world.
The way to tell is look for the 100xxx user ID's. While the 7xxxx
numbers are generally USA members who have been around for at least
a few years with 700xx and 701xx being among the charter subscribers
going *way back* into the early 1980's, and the 102xxx numbers are the 
more recent (past several months) arrivals (with 1027xx and 1028xx
being very new members in the past month or less, at least at this
writing), the 100xxx people are all from other countries. Some of the
Europeans have 7's if they have been around awhile, but most have 100's.

Check out CB in the early morning hours around 5-7 AM by our time here.
There will be a few -- very few -- die hards from the USA still on there
promoting their hustles and what not and just a few 100's. This morning I
called in to check my email about 7:00 AM and went over to peek at CB.
Between the general and the adult machines combined there were about 
sixty users in total, mostly from Europe. That, compared to midnight in
the USA when over a thousand people are on CB at one time. Last weekend
I think it was closer to 1500 people at one point. 

You'll see a shift in the user base there as the day goes on. All morning
long CB is full of 100's as the teenagers in the UK, France and those
areas get home from school and start logging in. By mid-afternoon, the
load is balanced between USA people and Europeans, and Australians seem
to get on there a lot also. As the evening wears on, the 100's begin
dropping off, and the 102's with their new computer and 'try it for
free' signup package start logging in. 

I got a letter here once from a fellow in Australia who said to me the
'only good thing I like about Compuserve and their outrageous rates'
(this was back when they were getting about nine dollars per hour flat
rate a few years ago) 'is using the CB Simulator for c-sex' ... I wrote
him back and said I found that sort of incredible because after all,
Compuserve CB is heavily populated by Americans; about 95 percent of
the crowd there are from the USA, and we Americans tend to do 'it' on
weekend nights. What was he going to find at night over there except
a mostly empty CB Simulator while the Americans were at their places
of employment or sleeping, etc?  His answer back was equally incredible: 
people on that side of the world long ago accepted that they have to
login Sunday afternoon 'while it is still Saturday night in the
States' if you want to 'get in on the fun'. So I thought to myself, no
wonder some of the Brits I meet on there are so crabby and distempered; 
I would be also at seven oclock on Sunday morning if I were up and
about in order to see what the Americans were up to with their computers 
at the same time.  <grin> .... PAT]

Yes, it is possible, as long as you have a router and a modem that can
agree on a serial interface (e.g., asynchronous EIA-423 or some
synchronous protocol), and the router supports dialup lines as well as
leased lines.  Or you could do it in software, running routed or gated
on a Unix machine with a PPP connection.

Please bear with me here, this is nothing I've ever gotten into
before, so I'm not sure if what I'm asking is possible/feasible/easy.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Here's the scenario:

Unix server based in location A;
Unix termainal based in location B;
Digital line connecting locations A and B with Motorola modems connecting 
server/terminal to the line.

This setup works and allows the terminal to connect and transact with
the server.

Now, the problem is:

Standalone Macs in location A;
Standalone Mac in location B.

I want to use the same digital line (it is *not* ISDN) to allow the
Macs to talk to each other, preferably using AppleTalk Remote Access.
I'm happy setting up the Macs, but I'm not sure hooking into about the
digital line.

I've been told that I can get put a modem on each Mac and connect them
(along with the existing modems) to some kind of multiplexor which
will zip the signal across to the other site where another multiplexor
splits the signal back into the respective modems/computers.

Is this true?  What do I need to do to get this to work?

Any suggestions/help greatly appreciated. I can supply more specific
information if needed.

No.  It isn't a regular line interface -- remember you're using cellular.  
The adapter needs to simulate a landline connection when it's really

You aren't going to get anywhere near 28.8.  Consider yourself lucky
at 14.4.  I think 9600 would be more like it.

I would think you would be better off by getting call forwarding on
your phone line and setting your line to call forward to cell before
logging on.  Also you can have others use the cell phone to make
outgoing calls. It's cheaper and simpler!

Before you play this game, question the unquestionable!

Take a pen and paper out and count out all your expenses.

Standard POTS lines may be cheaper and give you less equipment to
invest in.  Let me say this in another way: The more equipment you can
have your local Bell install, the more money you have.

Do the Math ...

The change may be a result of AT&T's implementation of "Equal Access"
in their newly acquired cellular systems.  Even though AT&T purchased
McCaw some time ago, they were prohibited from changing their "Cellular 
One" dba to "AT&T Wireless" until equal access was implemented.  (You

Also, it is important to note that different IXC's seem to have
different capabilities with respect to high speeds.  For example, I
regularly call from 206-285 to 713-652, and when using AT&T, I always
get a 26400 bps connection, but both Sprint and MCI always negotiate
at 24000 bps.

IEEE/VTS ONE DAY SEMINAR AT SRI INTERNATIONAL
November 3, 1995

100 YEARS OF WIRELESS

MARCONI'S DAUGHTER IN THE BAY AREA FOR THE CENTENNIAL OF RADIO

The San Francisco Bay Area IEEE/Vehicular Technology Society (VTS) is
sponsoring a One Day Seminar as part of the international events
commemorating Marconi and the centennial of radio.  The Bay Area VTS
seminar will coincide with the international events sponsored by the
Amici dell'Italia Foundation during Italian week, dedicated to
Guglielmo Marconi, and in cooperation with the Italian Consulate
General in San Francisco and the Amici dell'Italia Foundation.

The significance of this event is that it brings together industry and
academia experts from the United States and Italy, two of the worlds
Marconi connected with the first radio transmission across the Atlantic 
Ocean in 1901.

The VTS seminar "100 Years of Wireless" will take place on November 3rd at
SRI International in Menlo Park, California.  Marconi's Daughter, Gioia
Marconi Braga, will be the luncheon speaker.

Dr. William C.Y. Lee, Vice President and Chief Scientist at AirTouch
Communications, will be the keynote speaker.  The theme of the seminar
will span from historical to leading edge wireless technical presentations 
by the worlds foremost authorities.

Several of the speakers are members of the California scientific community
who share the honor or having been awarded the prestigious Marconi
International Fellowship in recognition of "significant contributions made to
the advancement of the technology of communications or knowledge transfer
through scientific or engineering discoveries, inventions or innovations".

This one day event is an extremely rare opportunity to meet Marconi's
daughter and listen to her first hand recollections of her father.  It will
also be an extremely rare opportunity to hear from the world's foremost
wireless and communications experts, some of whom are recognized in history
for their inventions and contributions.

The VTS November 3rd "100 Years of Wireless" seminar is one of many
significant international events.  The Guglielmo Marconi Foundation, based in
Bologna Italy where Marconi conducted his early experiments, is spearheading
many other international events.

Last June, Bologna was the site of a radio astronomy exhibit "Radio, From
Marconi to the Music of the Stars" and the Marconi International Fellowship
Symposium during which the President of Italy conferred the 1995 Marconi
Prize.  Also in June, the Bologna Radioexpo Exhibition hosted a spectacular
show on radio diffusion.  This show will be in New York at Columbia
University in October.

An itinerant exhibition entitled "100 Years of Radio" will be in Rome between
September 30 and December 10 and in Stockholm later in December during the
conferment of Nobel Prizes.

In the fall, Bologna University will host the 1995 European Microwave
Conference, the first European Personal and Mobile Communications Conference
and the 34th FITCE European Telecommunications Congress.  Premiere Italian
scientific organizations will host a conference during December on "Marconi
and the Organization of Scientific Culture" to be held in Rome.

The UK IEEE will hold an international conference on "100 Years of Radio
History" in London, September 5-7, in honor of Marconi patenting his
invention there in 1996 and founding the Marconi Telegraph Company.

Subject: New Internet/Telecom Product/Technology Wanted
Date: Fri, 22 Sep 1995 00:22:09 GMT
Organization: Rust Net - High Speed Internet in Detroit  810-642-2276


I would like to offer up a suggestion for a product, or perhaps I
should say a technology.  This is an idea that I had that is really an
extension of existing products, but I want to go on record as
proposing this now so that when someone gets the bright idea in a few
months or years, I can point to this as "prior art" (the Telecom
Archives ARE permanent, aren't they?).  :-)

The idea is this: At some point on the Internet you have a server that
connects to the telephone network.  It can detect ringing and seize
(answer) the line, or it can pick up the line and initiate outdialing.
So far all of this can be done using existing products (modems, for
example).  But what I would then propose for this new technology is to
take the audio from the phone line and convert it into an audio data
stream that can be sent to another location on the Internet.  In a
similar manner, this product should be able to accept an audio stream
from the Internet and send it out to the phone line.

On the user (client) end, a companion product (designed to work with
the server) would operate similar to IPhone or another two-way voice
over Internet product, except that when the server receives a ringing
signal from the telephone line, it would sent a data packet to the
user's program that would cause an audible (or other) signal to sound
or appear on the video display of the user's computer.  The user could
then take some action to "answer the phone" by causing the server to
take the phone line offhook and start the audio streams flowing, and
the computer user would then be able to hold a conversation with the
telephone caller.  Or, if the user wished to make an outgoing call,
they could enter a number to be called and then take some action
(keypress, mouse click, etc.) that would cause information to be
transmitted via the Internet that would cause the server to take the
line offhook, dial the requested number using touch tones or dial
pulses, and then start the audio data streams flowing, permitting the
user to converse with a called party.

In this situation, the telephone line would come into one location
that is connected to the Internet, and the user of the line could be
almost anywhere else on the Internet.  They'd be able to answer an
incoming call, or place an outgoing one, and then talk using an IPhone
or similar type interface.  Depending on the user's hardware (sound
card) and preference, the connection could be half duplex (either
"press a key/button to talk" or VOX type operation), or nearly
full-duplex (I say "nearly" because there would be a slight delay
inherent in sending audio streams via the Internet).

For those familiar with amateur radio phone patches, this would be a
similar type of connection, except that instead of connecting a
telephone line to a radio transceiver, it would connect to a device
that converts digital audio data streams sent via the Internet to and
from analog signals compatible with the telephone line.

I would expect that there would be some sort of authentication between
the client and server sides, probably in the form of a password
required to use the server (which would be sent automatically any time
a command was sent to pick up the line).  And care would have to be
taken that once a connect was initiated, no other user could "break
in" and grab the open line.  On the other hand, the server should be
capable of accepting connections from more than one client (and
multiple passwords, in case more than one user should be allowed to
have access to the server, and you want to have an accounting of which
user was connected at any particular time).

The uses should be obvious ... any time you want to answer a phone
line or place a call from a remote location that has an internet
connection, and don't care about a slight time delay (which might be
pretty minimal on some connections), this technology could be used.
Assuming decent connectivity, the connection (from the telephone side)
should sound no worse than, say, a patched call from a two-way radio
(or even from some cellular phones!).

Basically, this would be the equivalent of an "off premises extension"
using the Internet.  One possible application, given sufficently well
connected sites, would be to allow people to take calls coming into a
call center from another off-premises location, using the technology I
have proposed to carry the audio while they use some other software
(either local software or another net application) to actually look up
information, enter orders, etc.  You'd probably need an ISDN line or
other high capacity "pipe" to the off-premises location to get audio
quality and transmission speed sufficient to make this work.

Please, no flames about whether this SHOULD be done, how much
"bandwidth" it will consume, etc.  Both regulations and the capacity
of Internet connections vary from place to place.  What is illegal or
a drain on bandwidth in one place may be quite legal, and consume only
a fraction of a percent of available bandwidth in another place.  And
as we all know, regulations prohibiting bypass of the phone company
are being lifted in many places (if they're not gone already) and
higher capacity "pipes" are being constructed all the time (just as a
side note, I mentioned the bandwidth issue regarding audio streams to
a friend who works at an ISP.  He said that these would hardly be
noticed on their network, but they have a relative large "pipe" to the
backbone.  YMMV.  especially with a smaller provider).

The main ideas I want to have on record as "prior art", in case
nobody's tried to patent them yet (I hope), are:

1) The idea of taking a unidirectional or bidirectional digital audio
stream from the Internet and converting it to analog and sending it to
or from a telephone line,

2) The idea of using client software at a user's site on the Internet
to remotely control another device on the net that can initiate a call
or answer a call (this is prior art anyway, as folks have used remote
modems on the internet for over a decade, but this may be the first
time this has been proposed in connection with a device that would
send real-time audio streams to and from the line).

3) The idea of using authentication with such a system, so that
whenever a command is sent that would take the phone line off hook,
the command string would include a password or other mechanism that
would be verified by the server to insure that the user actually has
authority to remotely control the line.

4) And just to cover all the bases, I'll also suggest that an
adapation of this idea would allow someone to call into the Internet
using a server, have the call transported some distance over the
Internet as digital audio streams, and then sent back out into the
public switched telephone system at a distant point.  I'm not
suggesting this would work well, would be legal, or should be done,
but I want to go on record as saying it would be possible with the
right hardware and software.

Note that although I make reference to the Internet at several points
above, this technology could work in a similar manner on a private or
corporate network.

One final comment: It would be nice if perhaps a later version of this
technology would offer conference call capability (for example, one or
more users on the Internet and one or more "off-net" users connected
via phone lines, all taking turns on a voice conference).

It will be interesting to see how long it will be before someone comes
up with this technology.  It's not a question of "if", it's a question
of "when", IMHO.  I'd like to see it offered sooner rather than later,
and at a low enough price that companies and individuals can afford
it!

Well, that's my idea, as sent to the TELECOM Digest on September 15,
1995.  If anyone's already come up with something like this, I'm not
aware of it, so please let me know.  On the other hand, if anyone
decides to proceed with building this technology as a result of this
article, I'd be happy to help beta test the result (from the user
side, of course!)  :-)

already going on. I think I have read about it before on the net.

Turns out that some places 1 + NPA + 7D, where 7D is local does in
fact route correctly and get billed as a local number.  Makes for
dialing instructions on portable computers that travel across area
codes.

My example eas in Pacific Bell's area (408 to be specific) and I found
out about it quite by accident.  I set up my brother's computer (he
lives in 415, but we were in 408) and wanted to try it out (to dial a
408 number).  I just let it go, and it worked.  Astonished me!!

Now this is in a part of the country where 1 + NPA + 7D just started
this year, and the PUC hasn't forced us to make a difference between
1+ meaning toll (on ANY numbers).  Other posts have related that it
can get confusing in other parts of the country.

Again NANP dialing instructions ...

     A = Serial line, 115.2 kbps
     B = Box that splits a single 'a' channel into two simultaneous
         'b' channels.
     C = Four plain-jane 28.8 kbps modems.  One on each end of two
         POTS lines.
     D = Box that merges two simultaneous 'b' channels back into a
         single 'a' channel.  (Same box used for B)
     E = Serial line, 115.2 kbps

  Connection is TWS

  The DTE would be see the appearance of a plain-jane modem.  Perhaps with
  special dialing commands to cause the component modems to place their
  respective calls.  A and E appear as traditional DCE.

  The beauty of this is high speed through-put using POTS.  I don't have to
  even settle for two modems.  Perhaps three or four for uncommpressed 115.2
  thru-put, or more when compressed using special serial ports, e.g.  230.4
  kbps.  Each box would reassemble arriving packets to the original sequence.

  Sort of a reverse mux.  Anyone ever seen such a thing?

If what you mean by "Dialable Wideband Service" is the Multirate
service being rolled out in the US and defined in the 1993 version of
Q.931 then yes there is such a service called GloBand (or SwitchBand
in the UK).  It is based on a spec called Q.931W which is very similar
to the 1993 version of Multirate in Q.931 (although I can't say it is
the same).  For more info, contact Mercury in the UK or DIAX in
Denmark (+45 97 86 90 22).  I am not sure about an ETSI effort for
Multirate.

Which is why I so badly would like to see strong authentication become
an integral part of both online services and the Internet.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Your point is a good one. If I may for
a moment go back to the early 1980's when BBS'ing was first becoming
available, some of us argued back then that user authentication was
an absolute must. We were shot down time and again. The earliest BBS
lines were here in Chicago as most of you know. Ward Christianson and
Randy Suess started the whole concept in 1979 right here. The early
BBS lines were frequented by computer hobbyists many of whom were
'into' ham radio and CB. As a result, the users were like ham radio
people; i.e. polite, courteous, willing to help others learn about
their equipment. The first BBS lines were in fact largely intended as
gathering places for communicatations between people who used the same
kind of systems. We had 'Apple Bulletin Boards', 'Radio Shack Bulletin
Boards', etc.

Some of us started general purpose BBS's on certain themes or ideas
rather than on computer-types. Many folks viewed the early vandalism
of the boards as just aberations, things that would not happen very
often. We should have caught the drift from what happened when CB
radio became popularized (it was pretty well useless by the early
1980's) but we did not. By 1985 or so we were seeing more and more
BBS's change to 'read only access until authenticated' as a result
of the increasing vandalism and harrassment so many suffered. But when
I suggested in 1981 the BBS operated by the Chicago Public Library 
(where I was nominally the sysop) should have some method of verifying
who was who I was told that if people had to identify themselves in
order to have an account 'they will be frightened to post anything and
turned off; their freedom of speech and expression will be chilled ...'

And that was not only the attitude the librarian took with me, it was
a very common attitude among many BBS sysops. But those systems which
did convert to user authentification required before posting -- none
of them had it in the beginning -- found the nonsense, forgeries and
downright fraud come to almost a complete halt.  Nothing, it seems,
works as well at preventing misuse of a computer messaging system or
chat system as the user knowing that *you as sysadmin* know who he is.
The fact that the sysadmin or sysop had the ability to wake up in the
morning, find a bunch of garbage on his machine and call the person
on the phone who put it there essentially meant it did not happen
any more. That I could call you up and say, "uh Art, you were on the
board last night about midnight and you left this profane message
full of cussing and racial comments, etc. I was wondering why in the
world you would have posted such a thing?" ... the fact that the sysop
of the 'closed system' could do that meant that it was very seldom if
ever that he *had* to do it. 

Of course there was a trade off. The sysadmin had a duty to validate 
his users (that is not a sexist pronoun, there were no female sysops
in those days and female users were almost as rare) as promptly as
possible, and to be trustworthy about the names, addresses and phone
numbers collected. New users would often complain, "well I don't know
who this person (the sysop) is; I am not going to give out my name,
phone number and address to a stranger", and my answer always was, but
you expect me to be willing to allow a total stranger to use my
computer and visit electronically with me in my living room ...

I'd like to see user validation and authentication tighten up just a
bit also, especially on the commercial online systems where anyone with
the money can walk in and do their thing. At least at universities and
companies I would presume they have some verification of who works for
them or goes to school there. I'd like to see Caller-ID become a routine
thing on all incoming modem lines and no postings allowed (at least not
if they were going off the host machine) until the admin or some employee
specifically trained in validation/authentication proceedures was able
to send the password out by US Mail to the address of record *and* have
a one-minute or less phone conversation with the new user at the phone
number of record. Read all you want, no one cares who you are. If you
wish to post, you must be authenticated. Note I did not say *approved*,
merely authenticated. Do something to show you are real. Watch and
see how fast things would clean up; I promise.  And for those privacy
freaks who would complain about their freedom of speech being chilled
and how abused they will become when their phone and address are on
file with the admin, I would respond "thank you for your gratuitous
insults regarding my integrity. Find some other sucker willing to
provide you with a free public toilet."   End of sermon.    PAT]

Hi,

Someone gave me this number:

        +1 600 204 9507

The guy claims it's charged (he's calling from The Netherlands) at a
far higher tarif than "normal" charges from The Netherlands -> U.S.A.

What's happening? I thought the 600 NPA was still listed as "reserved
for future use".

Did I miss something?


Thanks,

Jan Joris


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I think that on this side of the pond,
600 is used for Canadian telex and TWX stuff. That was in 610 and it
got moved out. However I have heard that from elsewhere in the world
1-600 is a bogus code that gets you an international sex phone service.
How they reconcile that with legitimate telex users in other countries
who want to call a TWX machine in Canada, I do not know. I suppose you
could say there are two 'six hundreds'; one that only other machines
on the telex/TWX network can reach and one that only people in the
Netherlands (or elsewhere in Europe?) can reach. As for us here in
the USA, I don't think we can dial into 600 at all from a voice line.

In other news: this Sunday, September 24 marks the 53rd anniversary
of my hatching. I was born quite early in life you know. Where the
years have gone, I cannot begin to imagine. And the more I learn, the
dumber I realize I am. Was it Mark Twain who once said that as a child
he was always quite embarassed by how dumb his parents were. He said
that as the years went by he was really amazed how much his parents
had learned, and how smart they had become. Ditto here.   PAT]
