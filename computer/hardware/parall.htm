This document is called an FAQ because it answers many commonly asked 
questions about the IBM parallel port, but it is formatted more as a brief
tutorial.  Read it twice before asking for more info; some stuff comes 
late.<p>

Most of this I puzzled out for myself from various documention and 
experiences.  The IBM documentation has some errors; I've had to cross 
correlate various sources including schematics to get a consistent and 
workable picture.  Since the first version, others have contributed 
information, proofreading, and suggestions (see acknowledgements).<p>

Starting with the original IBM PC, IBM defined a standard parallel printer
port which has become very widespread.  This port uses a female DB-25S
connector on the computer, and a special male DB-25P to Centronics male 36 
pin &quot;IBM Printer cable&quot; is used to connect to standard Centronics parallel 
printers.  This DB-25 connector is possible because about half of the 
Centronics pins carry just electrical ground.<p>

The original definition was embodied in the &quot;IBM Printer Adaptor&quot;, and the
&quot;IBM Monochrome Display and Printer Adaptor&quot; cards.<p>

An electrical &quot;high&quot; (on a pin or line) is TTL high, +2.4 to +5 volts.
An electrical &quot;low&quot; is TTL low, 0 to +0.8 volts.<p>

A data high is a 1, a data low is a 0.<p>

The connection between data (eg: a register bit) and pins is direct if a
data 1 is associated with an electical TTL high, and inverted if data 1
is associated with TTL low.  An overall connection (data to TTL to data)
is considered direct if outputing a 1 produces a 1 on input at the other
end, or inverted if outputting a 1 produces a 0 on the other end.<p>

Pin labels, like &quot;-Strobe&quot; or &quot;+Busy&quot;, are as defined by the printers and
by IBM.  The prefix "-" (or draw a line over the name) implies that the
signal is "active low"; that is, that when the signal is in its active state
when electically low.  The "+" prefix means "active high", just the opposite.<p>

I have labeled the Data Out register bits as D0 to D7, with D0 being the 
least significant bit and D7 the most signficant.  The Control Out bits are
labeled C0 to C3 (for the ones which go to pins) and C4 (for IRQ enable), 
and maybe C5 (for bidirection ports only, controls direction).  The Status
In bits are labeled S3 to S7 (corresponding to data and CPU bit positions).
Often I will suffix C0 to C3 and S3 to S7 with a "+" or "-" as a reminder
of whether or not that register bit is inverted as compared to the output
or input pin it is associated with; "-" is for inverted, of course.  All
the Data Out bits are direct (not inverted); likewise data in for 
bidirectional printer ports, but I have not bothered to suffix a "+".<p>

Hexadecimal numbers are prededed by "0x", the C convention.<p>

A "tristated" or disabled electical output basically disconnects the output
from the line or pin (high impedance), neither driving it high nor low.<p>

<a name="PARALLEL_004"><h1> Addresses, naming, BIOS and DOS </h1></a>

IBM defined three standard port base addresses (in 80x86 IO address space).
The Printer Adaptor could use base address 0x378, or later 0x278, while
the Monochrome Display and Printer Adaptor used base address 0x3BC.<p>

The IBM BIOS defines RAM space for 4 parallel printer port base addresses,
stored as 4 16 bit words starting at main memory address 0x408.  During 
bootup, the BIOS will check for parallel printer ports at base addresses 
0x3BC, 0x378, and 0x278, in order, and store the base addresses of any 
that are found in consecutive locations in this table.  Unused entries 
may be 0, or some BIOSes fill them with the first port address found.  
Some software may ignore this table, but it is used by at least the BIOS 
itself (eg: INT 17, Printer I/O), and by DOS, as described below.<p>

The BIOS detects these ports by writing 0xAA to the Data Out register (at 
I/O address Base+0), reading the Data Feedback register (same address), and
deciding there is a port installed if it reads 0xAA.  This could be confused
if any lines are externally pulled up or down (or if the port defaulted to
tristate, or if there is another readback device register at that address).  
The BIOS also counts the number of parallel ports it found and stores this 
count in the upper two bits of the byte at 0x411 (yes, the table can hold 
up to 4 entries, but the BIOS equipment flag printer count only goes to 3).<p>

Warning: Just before this table there are 4 words at 0x400 which contain up
to 4 entries for base addresses for serial COM ports.  At least some serial 
port software is known to store more than 4 entries, thus overlapping the
parallel port table.  Hopefully this is rare!<p>

DOS (MSDOS and IBM DOS) maps these as LPTn devices.  Unlike COMn devices and
comm ports, the name mapping varies depending on whether or not there is a
Monochrome Display and Printer Adaptor card or not.  The first entry in
the BIOS table at 0x408 becomes LPT1, the second entry LPT2, and the third
entry LPT3 (if there are that many).  The DOS device "PRN" is really 
software alias for another port, by default LPT1; use the MODE command to 
change this aliasing.  The following table has "typical" assignments.<p>

Note that by swapping the entries in the BIOS table at 0x408, you can change
which physical ports are assigned to LPT1, LPT2, etc.  Several "printer 
swap" programs do just that.<p>

<a name="PARALLEL_007"><h1> Electrical Specifications </h1></a>

See also the tutorial section below on TTL outputs.<p>

The Data Out pins were orginally driven by a 74LS374 octal latch, which could
source 2.6 mA and sink 24 mA.  There were 0.0022uF capacitors between each 
line and ground to reduce transients.  The manual warns "It is essential that 
the external device not try to pull these lines to ground", as this might 
cause the 74LS374 to source more current than it could handle without damage.<p>

The Feedback input for the Data Out register consisted of a 74LS244 latch; it
is uninverted.  Note that this port is only for diagnostics - if at any time
the feedback register for the data port does not match the data being output,
there is an error (eg: a line stuck high or low).  Exception: bidirectional
printer ports allow the 74LS374 (or equivalent) driver chip to be tristated,
which makes the data feedback port into a legitimate unlatched input port.<p>

The Control Out pins were driven by 7405 inverting open collector buffers,
pulled to +5 volts via 4.7K resistors.  All data lines except C2 are inverted
before going to output pins; data line C2 is double inverted before going to 
pin 16 (ie: is not inverted).<p>

The Feedback input for the Control Out register also inverted all but D2, 
which was passed through uninverted.  It is possible to use some or all of
the control out port bits for input, by programming the corresponding 
control out to high (remembering the inversion on C0, C1, and C3), in which
case the open collector outputs are pulled high by the 4.7K resistors; any
externally applied high will retain the high state, while an externally
applied low will pull down the electical level to low.  This can be read
via the corresponding feedback bit(s).  If either the output from the control
register, or an externally applied signal, are low, then the input will be 
low.  Remember the inversions between this electrical level and the bits, tho.<p>

The Status In register is inverted for only pin 10, register bit S7.<p>

ESD <b>(From Steven M. Scharf)</b><p>

LSI implementations of the parallel port have often had serious ESD 
(electrostatic discharge; includes static electricity) problems. National 
and other high-end manufacturers have added extensive anti-ESD circuitry 
to the parallel port signal lines; on cheap parallel port designs on some 
other SuperIO clones ESD can easily destroy the parallel port circuit 
when you turn the printer on when the computer is off or the printer is 
on a switchbox.<p>

<a name="PARALLEL_008"><h1> Timing </h1></a>

The original IBM Printer Adapter which came out along with the PC (floppy 
disks, pre XT) was built from TTL MSI parts.  They (and their clones) were 
fast enough to work with the later AT bus, now called ISA, and still do.  
I've yet to hear of a TTL printer adapter which is too slow for an ISA bus.
Partly this is because it was simple and fast in bus access (unlike the
serial port 8250 chip), and partly this is because even fast 486's slow
their ISA bus down to 8-11 MHz typically.<p>

<a name="PARALLEL_009"><h1> How to Print to a standard printer </h1></a>

This is as defined for early IBM printers, and more or less compatible with
most others that use the Centronics 36 pin interface.<p>

<ol>
<li> Wait for not +Busy (+Busy low)
<li> Set Data Out bits
at least 0.5 uS delay
<li>Pulse -Strobe low for at least 0.5 uS
hold Data Out for at least 0.5 uS after end of -Strobe pulse
<li> Some time later, printer will pulse -Ack low for at least 5 uS
<li> Printer may lower +Busy when it raises -Ack at end of pulse
<li> Set other Control outputs or check Status inputs as desired.
</ol>

<a name="PARALLEL_010"><h1> BIOS Printer Support </h1></a>

The PC ROM BIOS detects and initializes the printer ports on bootup, and
provides printer support via INT 17 (and indirectly uses this in INT 5 
"Print Screen").  The detection and building of a printer port base address
table is described in the Soft Addresses section above.<p>

To control the printer via the BIOS, call INT 17 with the printer number in 
DX (0 to 3, indexing into the four entry table at 0x408 mentioned in the
Soft Addresses section above), and the desired function in AH.  Functions:<p>

  <dl>
  <dd>AH = 0: print the character in AL
  <dd>AH = 1: reinitialize the port, return status in AH
  <dd>AH = 2: return status in AH
  </dl>

BIOS operation notes follow.<p>

The BIOS normally keeps the Control register value as 0x0C:<p>

  <dl>
<dd>C5 = 0  =&gt;  output enabled (for bidirectional only)
<dd>C4 = 0  =&gt;  IRQ disabled
<dd>C3 = 1  =&gt;  -Select pin low    (Printer Selected)
<dd>C2 = 1  =&gt;  -Init pin high     (Printer not being initialized)
<dd>C1 = 0  =&gt;  -AutoFeed pin high (No Auto Feed)
<dd>C0 = 0  =&gt;  -Strobe pin high   (No Stobe)
  </dl>

The BIOS prints a character (function AH = 0) as follows:<br>
   (Uses only  Status in S7/+Busy and Control out C0/-Strobe)<p>
   <dl>
   <dd>Write character to Data Out (D0-D7)
   <dd>Wait for bit S7 to go to 1 (-Busy pin to go high/low?)<br>
      Timeout and return if this takes too long
   <dd>Set C0 to 1 for a few microseconds (-Strobe pin pulsed low)
   </dl>

   This assumes that the printer was already ready.<p>

The BIOS handles reinitializing the printer (function AH = 1) thus:
   Set C2 = 0 for a few hundred microseconds (-Init pin pulsed low)<p>

The BIOS returns status in AH (functions AH = 1 or 2) is as follows:<p>

 <pre>
 __________________________________
 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2  | 1 | 0 |
   |   |   |   |   |  not used  |___ 1 = "Time Out" (software)
   |   |   |   |   |________________ 1 = "I/O Error" (inv C3+; -Error pin low)
   |   |   |   |____________________ 1 = "Selected"  (C4+; +SelectIn pin high)
   |   |   |________________________ 1 = "Paper Out" (C5+; +PaperEnd pin high)
   |   |____________________________ 1 = "Acknowledge" (inv C6+; -Ack pin low)
   |________________________________ 1 = "Not Busy"  (C7-; +Busy pin low)
 </pre>

 The high 5 bits of this are essentially the Status In register from the
 printer port, with bits 6 and 3 inverted (ie: XORed with 0x48).  The low
 bit is generated by BIOS software after a timeout.  In the original PC,
 timeout delays were generated by delay loops.<p>

<hr>

<a name="PARALLEL_011"><h1> IRQ's </h1></a>

The primary IBM Printer Adapter (base 0x378) and the IBM Monochrome Display
and Printer Adapter (base 0x3BC) are allocated hardware interrupt 7 (IRQ 7),
which is wired to INT 0x0F.  If bit C4 of the Control Out register is high,
then input line "-ACK" (DB 25 pin 10, Status Register bit S6) will be wired 
to the IRQ 7 bus line.  A rising edge (low to high) on -Acknowledge will be 
cause a rising edge on IRQ 7, which will trigger an interrupt if that IRQ is 
enabled in the 8259 interrupt controller chip.  (Note: the MCA bus is level 
sensitive rather than edge triggered).  Both cards use the same interrupt,
and the ISA bus does not share interrupts correctly, so no more than one 
of these ports should be enabled at the same time (or the 74LS125 chips 
driving the PC bus will fight).<p>

Secondary Printer Adapters (base 0x278) are supposed to use IRQ 5 (INT 0x0D)
for their interrupt; note that on the PC (pre-AT) this would have conflicted 
with the floppy disk controller.  This IRQ is even more commonly "stolen"
for other usage: EGA, soundcards, network cards, etc.<p>

The idea was apparently to use this IRQ as part of the printer driver, much
as the serial port IRQs can be used as part of comm drivers.  Unfortunately,
typical timing on printers did not allow this, so most (nearly all) DOS 
software does not use the printer port IRQ for driving printers.  It's often
considered "up for grabs" and some soundcards like to use IRQ 7.  Some other
operating systems may use it for the printer port, as may some parallel port 
transfer programs.<p>

<hr>

<a name="PARALLEL_012"><h1> Bidirectional Ports </h1></a>

The IBM PS/2 series added one feature to the parallel ports: bidirectional 
support.  This was done by using one more bit in the Control Out register
to control tristating of the Data Out port.  When bit C5 is 0, the Data
Out port operates as it did for earlier parallel ports (driver enabled); 
when C5 is set to 1, though, the Data Out port is tristated, which means
that it is essentially electically disconnected from the pins (high 
impedance state), not driving them high nor low.  This allows the data 
feedback register to correctly read any externally applied TTL signals 
on the corresponding data pins, effectively making this an input port.<p>

Interestingly, the original IBM Printer Adapter, and many early clones,
had everything needed to become bidirectional.  The 74LS374 chip has a
chip enable pin which can tristate the 8 data outputs, but it is usually
wired to ground to always enable the output drivers.  The 74LS174
latch used for C0-C4 is actually a hex latch and processor data bus line
5 is attached to the sixth latch input; that bit IS latched when you 
write to the Control Out register - but the output (Q6 on the 74LS174) 
is not used by anything.  If you cut the trace from pin 1 (/OE) of the
74LS374 to ground, and connect this pin instead to pin 15 (Q6) of
the 74LS174, voila - you have a PS/2 compatible bidirectional parallel
port.  This only works on the older discrete TTL parallel ports, including
the IBM Printer Adapter and at least some clones of that era.  One theory 
is that IBM had a bidirectional port in mind initially, but decided to
omit that aspect at the last moment (even while still latching the C5
bit from the processor into the LS174 hex latch).<p>

There are now PS/2 compatible third party bidirectional parallel ports.
The cost for a TTL bidirectional port should have been identical, but now 
that parallel ports are done with one LSI chip (or a fraction of one), this 
will require an appropriate LSI chip.  Apparently some of them now have
bidirectional ports, some do not.<p>

Note that some people have for many years been using the standard (not
bidirectional) data out port as an input port.  They output data 0xFF, 
that is, all high.  Any pins which are externally pulled low via TTL or
switches will probably read as low (0) in the data feedback register, 
because TTL low (sinking current) tends to be stronger than TTL high 
(sourcing current), and tend to "win" when there two drivers fighting on
the same line.  An external high signal, or no signal, will allow the
pin (and data bit) to remain high (1).  This is NOT reccommended, as it
stresses the 74LS374 (or equivalent) beyond its safe margins and could
cause chip failure.  However, some people report doing this for years
without problem.  Note that all recent parallel ports are implemented
with single chip LSI controllers rather than the MSI TTL originals, which
means that they may have different drive capacities, electical margins,
and replacement costs, should you attempt this approach.  Sometimes the
LSI controller also includes other functions, such as serial ports or a
monochrome display port; if it overheats, more than just the parallel 
port could be damaged.  Beware.  However, if you have an old TTL parallel
port (with a 74LS374 chip, preferably socketed), it may be easy and cheap
to replace if that chip should die.<p>

I bought TTL parallel port card clones, fully socketed (all chips!), for
about $15 mail order about 5 years ago.  The bidirectional conversion was
a trace cut and a wire jumper.  The 74LS374 was easily replaced, if it
were damaged or if one wanted a better chip like the 74ACT374.  You could 
even strap it for any base address (including non standard ones, so as not 
to conflict).  I wish I could get more; there must have been scads of these
on the market.  You may find old TTL printer ports used; latch onto them 
if you want to experiment with parallel port interfaces (pun acknowledged).<p>

One last electrical note: if you use any sort of bidirectional parallel port
for inputs, be sure to tristate it whenever it is connected to external
devices which will drive it.  When I'm running it this way, I put a small 
routine in my autoexec.bat which tristates the port in question on every
bootup.  Or use inline resistors to at least limit the current to a safe
value.<p>

Steven M. Scharf notes that some higher end parallel
port chips "lock" the direction control bit C5 to keep certain naive software
from accidentally changing the port direction.  In particular, he says that
"PTR bit 7" of the National Semiconductor SuperI/O chip must be 1 before you
can change the direction control bit.  I don't have documentation on this
chip, so I'm not sure what register PTR is; for now, consider this just a
warning.  He says that other chips may lock the direction control 
differently.<p>

<a name="PARALLEL_013"><h1> Enhanced Ports </h1></a>

There are at least two specs for further enhanced parallel ports, the EPP
(Enhanced Parallel Port) and the ECP (Enhanced Capability Port), with the
latter being more ambitious.  I would appreciate any specs that can be 
forwarded to me (or references) on either of these.<p>

<a name="PARALLEL_014"><h1> Copy Protection Dongles </h1></a>

<b>(From info provided by Steven M. Scharf)</b><p>

Copy protection dongles typically watch the data lines for patterns of
data without any -strobe signal (pin 1, controlled by C0-).  That is, the
copy protection software writes various patterns to the data lines without
ever pulsing the -strobe line.  Without a pulse on -strobe, any printer 
also attached to the port should ignore this data.  Not all dongles work
on all ports; this strobeless method is a bit more temperamental than
regular printer output.<p>

Steven M. Scharf: "I heard one dongle manufacturer complain to me about 
a parallel port from Taiwan that tristated all the data lines between 
every write to the data lines. This presented a pattern of FF to the dongle, 
but had no effect on the printer since there was no strobe. In this case 
the software was writing a sequence of bytes to the dongle and it didn't 
work due to the FF in between each expected real byte."<p>

"The dongle also draws power from the signal lines--a definite no-no. 
Dongles should be designed to operate all the way down to the minimum TTL 
low or at least to minimum Vout High of 2.4V. If your dongle doesn't work 
but your printer works fine then it is almost certainly the fault of the 
dongle--not the parallel port. Software with an incompatible dongle to the
parallel port on a machine will not be usable on that machine--one more
reason to not penalize the legitimate buyers of software."<p>

"Another area that might be of interest in your document would be some 
comment on the parallel port extenders. I have a xmit/rcv pair from LinkSys 
that I bought from Fry's Electronics for about $70. They convert the parallel 
signal to a serial data stream, using the signal and control lines for power. 
My set was working fine until I added a hardware dongle for an expensive 
Windows application. Then, printing ceased to work reliably. I took the 
transmitter apart and partially traced the schematic. They have used 7 
diodes to suck power from pins 13, 14, 15, 17, 1, 2, and 3.  Also, they 
connected pins 15 (ERR) to 16 (INIT). The strobe line is coupled in to a 
flip-flop, which starts clocking the parallel loaded data."<p>

Comment from Zhahai - with both a dongle and a parallel port extender trying
to draw power from the port's data or control (not power) lines, it's not
surprising if things don't always work!  It must be really pushing the specs.<p>

<a name="PARALLEL_016"><h1> Transferring Data Via Ports </h1></a>

There are three basic ways to wire IBM printer ports together to transfer
data between them.  The most common is to wire D0 - D4 (or D3-D7) from one
port to S3 - S7 from the other port, and vice versa.  In this way, 4 bits of
data can be put out by one (eg: D0 - D3) and read by the other (eg: S3 - S6);
the other bit (eg: D4/S7) can be used for synchronizing (eg: Data Ready).
If data is transferring one way, the Dn/Sn path the other direction can be
used for acknowledgements.  In this scheme, you must remember that S3 - S6
read the inverse of the other computer's D0 - D3 data bits, but S7 has the
same value as D4 (or D3 - D6 and D7 respectively, for the alternate wiring).
Also remember that S6 and S7's mapping to pins is swapped in order from the
others.<p>

If a two bidirectional ports are left connected in this fashion, and they
are both enabled (eg: after powerup or reset) with different data outputs,
then the 74LS374 driver chips could be "fighting".  Just to be careful,
when I created a cable like this (actually, a DB25 jumper box usually sold
for RS-232 jumpering, along with straight through 25 line DB-25 cables), I
used 8 10K resistors between the corresponding Data lines, to limit current
in this case.  (Actually, a DIP resistor pack fit perfectly on the PC board
inside the DB-25 jumper box).  The resistors are large enough to keep TTL
output from overstressing another one if both enabled, but when one is
disabled and the other enabled, the resistors are low enough to allow the
TTL output to drive a TTL input well enough.<p>

<a name="PARALLEL_018"><h1> Capturing "printed" data from another machine </h1></a>

A computer with a bidirectional printer port, connected with a Mode 2
cable to any standard port, could potentially pretend to be a printer
so as to capture the "printed" information.  It would configure its
Data port for input, and set appropriate values on its Control Out to
mimic a printer on the other computer's Status In lines.  In the general 
case, the problem would be detecting the very brief -Strobe pulse; this
would either require an external TTL latch triggered by -Strobe (either
edge), or some way to sense a quick pulse on that line.  In the latter
case, a revised connection (call it Mode 2B) could connect the "printing"
computer's -Strobe (C0-) line to the receiving computer's -Ack (S6+) line;
the trailing edge of the printing computer's -Stobe would generate an
interrupt on the receiving computer.  I have not tried this.  Of course,
the +Busy line would also be needed to avoid data overflow; perhaps it
could be kept high (busy) most of the time, but pulsed low after reading
the data (which would be handled by the IRQ routine).<p>

[If anybody has had some success with this, let me know.]<p>

<hr>

<a name="PARALLEL_019"><h1> Controlling Outputs </h1></a>

This can be easy; just use the Data Out TTL signals to control TTL level
items.  Unfortunately, they cannot source much current (providing positive
voltage on the pin, relative to ground) - be careful of the 2.6 mA limit.
Some LSI implementations might allow more or less than this (likely less).<p>

<pre>
        Dn Out ------+
                     |+
  Sourcing         Load (up to 2.6 mA @ 2.4 v)
                     |-
        Ground ------+
</pre>

If you have an external +5 volt supply, you have two options: use the Data
Out pins to sink up to 24 mA from your +5 volt supply, or use buffer chips
to control (source or sink) more current (or higher voltages).  I have 
used an exteranl 5 Volt supply (regulated wall wart) plus optocoupled solid
state relays as the "load", to control AC voltages (keep the high AC voltages
away from any of this logic level stuff, obviously).<p>

<pre>
                  +-------------------------- (+5 v)
                  |+
Sinking         Load (up to 24 mA @ 4.2v)
                  |-	                      Power Supply
     Dn Out ------+

     Ground --------------------------------- ( Gnd)
</pre>

Use limiting resistors if you need to limit the current.<p>

If the load were an LED (or optocoupler) through which you wished to put 
20 mA, do the calculations.  The Dn Output will probably be around 0.7 
volts, so you have about 4.3 volts of drop; the LED will drop about 1.9 v 
(check specs!), leaving 2.4 V to be dropped by a resister at 20 mA: 120 
ohms.  Test and measure, adjust to fit.<p>

You can also use the Control Out pins.  They can't source much of anything
(about 1 mA through the 4.7K resistors to +5), and can only sink about 7mA.
(The LS TTL gate actually sinks 8 mA, but one is taken up by the 4.7 K 
resistor to +5).  Again, check on clones with different electical specs.  
This can control TTL inputs fine, and might be able to run an optocoupler
or solid state relay in sink mode (depends on the device).<p>

In one application, I used two 74ACT374 latches, which can source 48 mA
or sink 64 mA.  I connected the 8 inputs of each to the Data Out, and the
latch clocks to two Cn outputs.  In software, I put out 8 bits of data
on the Data Out port, pulsed a Cn bit to latch it into one 74ACT374,
put the next 8 bits out on Data Out, and used the other Cn bit to latch it
into the other 74ACT374 - voila, 16 bits of  64mA output control.  Of course,
this took a separate +5 V power supply ($5 surplus regulated wall wart).<p>

If you can still find an old TTL parallel port (especially with sockets),
you can substitute the 74ACT374 chip for the original 74LS374 and get better
drive capability.  The back of magazine suppliers were selling *fully 
socketed* TTL based parallel ports for about $15 a few years back; by cutting
a trace and soldering a jumper you could make them bidirectional; by plugging
in a $1 chip you could make them source/sink 48/64 mA.  You might still find
such TTL parallel port cards in old PCs.  Typically, one designed for the
original PC will still work fine on the ISA bus of your 486DX2-66, so don't
worry about that.<p>

<hr>

<a name="PARALLEL_020"><h1> Sensing switches </h1></a>

There are several ways to sense external switches via a parallel printer
port.  If you are dealing with naked switches, the simplest is actually
to connect up to 4 switches between the control outputs (pins 1,14,16, and 
17) and ground, program the control outputs high (counting inversions), and
use the control feedback register to read switch state (counting inversions).
This is because the pull-up resisters are already implemented for the open
collector Control Out pins.<p>

<pre>
Cn Out ------+	(Program output high; read feedback)
             |
           switch
             |
Ground ------+
</pre>

Another simple method would be to use up to 5 pullup resistors (4.7K) from
the Status inputs to +5 volts, and use switches to pull these down to ground.
One disadvantage of this is that it uses an external +5 supply.  TTL inputs
tend somewhat to float high, so you *might* get by without the pullup 
resistors, but you are pushing it.<p>

<pre>
               4.7K
Sn In -------+-^^^^^--- (+5 v)   (Read status register)
             |
           switch
             |
Ground ------+---------- (gnd)
</pre>

You could use this same scheme for 8 inputs on the data lines of a 
bidirectional printer port - but you have to be sure that the outputs are
tristated beforehand, or your switches may damage the 74LS374 (or equiv).
This latter may be a problem after booting or rebooting.  One approach
is to use current limiting resistors in series "just in case".  You should
ideally still have pullup resistors too.  (The 1K value is chosen for LS TTL,
to keep the 2.4 V output at no more than 2.4 mA sourcing).<p>

In an upcoming project, I want to use a 4x4 keypad as an input.  In this 
type of keypad (warning: there are other types), each key makes a connection
from one row to one column, when pressed.  My first design has the "columns" 
connected to the 4 Control Out pins, while the "rows" are connected to 4 of 
the Status Inputs.  Normally, all 4 control outputs were programmed high,
but to scan the keypad, I would lower one control output at a time, and
read the 4 status inputs at that time.  The 4 status inputs are each
pulled high to +5 volts via a 10K resistor, or left to float.  (Use Dn
plus resistors rather than +5 external supply?)  This scheme could be 
expanded to as large as 4x5 (4 Cn outputs, 5 Sn inputs).<p>

Alternate scheme.  Use Dn's for scanning output rows, through diodes which 
will isolate them from each other if two keys in the same column are pressed.
(Otherwise we have drivers fighting, and indeterminate voltage levels).
Germanium small signal diodes have less voltage drop.  Use the Cn pins
as inputs (with existing pullups) - program Control Out for high TTL levels,
and read the feedback register for input (counting inversions).  No extra 
power supply is needed.  The diode between TTL output low and TTL input low 
will push the TTL noise margins, but you can usually get by with it.  This 
scheme could be expanded up to 8x4 (8 Dn outputs, 4 Cn used as inputs).  If
we know that only one key (or one key per column) will be pressed at a time, 
the diodes can be omitted.<p>

a box, it will appear as if all 4 corners are pressed; this is true of any
such matrix, unless each switch has its own diode.<p>

I hope to have some results to share in a later revision of this doc.<p>

<a name="PARALLEL_023"><h1> Tutorial on TTL outputs </h1></a>

In response to requests, here is a brief tutorial on chip outputs.  As a 
preface, it is conventional to discuss current as flowing from positive to
negative, even though we know full well that electrons actually move in the
opposite directions; it's just a convention, not ignorance.<p>

Regular TTL outputs basically consist of a two "stacked" transistor in series 
between +5 volts and ground, with the output coming from the connection between 
them.  This is called a "totem pole output".  At any given time one of these 
transistors is conducting and the other is not.  To pull the output "high", 
the transistor from +5 to the output conducts (H), which "sources" positive 
current from the output to ground (that is, an external device between the 
output and ground will get power).  To pull the output low, only the lower 
transistor (L) conducts, "sinking" current to ground; an external device 
between +5 volts and the output can be energized.  Current flows into the
chip for low, out of it for high.<p>

The 0 / pull low current capacity (sinking) is larger than the 1 / pull high 
capacity (sourcing).  If you want to drive something like an LED, or a solid
state relay, you can get more current from the TTL outputs by connecting it
between +5 and the gate output (second picture) - *if* it's electrically
isolated from ground.  You still have to check the current and voltage
ratings, tho.<p>

One key here is that the chip is always trying to pull either high 
or low, and the currently conducting transistor has voltage and current 
limits, beyond which it can be damaged.  It is not good design to connect 
two such outputs which may have different states - one pulling high and one 
low - because this will exceed the current specs.  However, if you do, the 
one pulling low will "win", since TTL can sink (pull low) more strongly
than it can source (pull high).  And there is some slack in the specs, so 
this does not always immediately damage the chip; we'll get back to this.
These are the type of outputs on the DATA lines on the original IBM 
parallel port.  (Well, not exactly, but I'll get back to that too).<p>

Another type of output is the "open collector".  In this case, there is a
transistor from the output pin to ground, but none to +5 volts.  The two
states are 0, "conducting to ground" (pulling low), and 1, "not conducting" 
(floating, not pulled either way).  Externally, you can connect a resistor
of proper value between the line and +5 volts to pull the line high when 
the chip output is floating.  The value is chosen such that when the output 
is conducting to ground, it overpowers the external resistor and the line 
goes low.  The advantage of this scheme is that you can connect multiple 
open collector outputs together (or even slip in one totem pole).  Every 
output that is floating is ignored (and the resistor will pull the line 
high if and only if all outputs are floating); multiple outputs pulling 
low cause no conflict.  This is the type of output used for CONTROL lines 
in the original IBM parallel port.<p>

Since each parallel port control output line has a corresponding feedback 
bit that can be read (mainly for diagnostics, to see if the line really goes 
high or low), it is possible to program these CONTROL outputs "high" (really 
floating), and then allow external signals control the high or low state
of the line.  An external open collector output, or a totem pole one, is 
capable of pulling the line high (reinforcing the pullup resistor) or low 
(overpowring it) without exceeding current specs.  In this way you can use
the control lines as inputs.  If there is no external signal, it will read
high.  However, you must program the CONTROL outputs high (taking into
account any logical inversions between the register bits and the electrical
outputs); if the open collector output is low (conducting to ground), the 
external signal won't be able to pull it high (or at least not without 
exceeding the specs).<p>

The same thing can be done with totem pole outputs - program them high, and
let external logic pull them high (no problem, both pulling up) or low 
(overpowering the attempt to pull high), but in this case you are overloading
the H transistor, rather than a pullup resistor, and exceeding spec, with
possible unreliability or damage.  However, this has been successfully done 
with the data outputs of a conventional parallel port, and some people claim
not to have seen any damage yet.  Don't blame me if you do it and something
dies.<p>

A third type of gate is a totem pole in which both high and low transistors
can be non-conducting at once, creating a third, floating state (this is often
called a tri-state output).  When it is in this third state, the line is not
being pulled high nor low by this device, and thus can be safely controlled 
by some other device.  No pullup resistor is used.  The  74LS374 chip used 
for the standard parallel port DATA outputs actually has tristate ability, 
but as described elsewhere the third state is not used, and it is always
trying to pull high or low - thus my initial description of the DATA lines
as totem pole drivers.<p>

The way true bidirectional parallel ports work is to allow the software to
selectively put the DATA outputs into the third, undriven state.  Then you
can use the data feedback register to read whatever highs or lows are put
onto the data lines externally.<p>
 
Non-TTL logic, like CMOS, has the equivalents of these, but with a different
type of transistor, and different voltage and current values.  If your 
parallel port uses a single chip or otherwise differs from the original
IBM parallel port, the above electrical description cannot be guaranteed,
but it is probably pretty analogous.  Let me know if you have specific 
knowledge about the electical specs of your single chip parallel port, for
future versions of this document.<p>

Note again that high and low in this description are electrical levels, as
would me measured by a voltmeter on the pins; high is associated with TTL
logic 1, but whether a given CONTROL output line is high when the 
corresponding register bit is 1 or 0 varies with the line, as is described
elsewhere in this document.  The DATA lines are straight through, with no
inversions, so a 1 bit produces a high output.<p>
