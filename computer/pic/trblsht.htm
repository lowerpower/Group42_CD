<h1>Troubleshooting/Modifying your Serial PIC programmer</h1>
<hr>
The graphical schematics shown on Anitti's page are drawn for
a 9-pin serial connection.  The pin-pin translation is shown below:<br>
<pre>

  9 pin      -       25 pin

    3                 2
    5                 7
    7                 4
    4                 20
    8                 5
</pre>

If your programmer does not work, you may want to try some of these
hints:<br>
<ul>
<li> to reduce confusion for those of you in the western hemisphere, 4K7 is equivalent to 4.7K 
<li> From the ground pin, run a ground wire to the metal chassis of the hood.
<li> Place a small (12 pf?) capacitor between the ground and TXD pin.
<li> Make sure you are using a 78L05 not a 7805. The 7805 consumes the precious few millivolts/amps necessary to drive the circuit.
<li> I think the resistor pot was placed between CTS and DTR (pins 4 & 8)
</ul>

I have found these to solve some problems with "finicky" serial ports.<br>
Good luck. Have fun.<br>
