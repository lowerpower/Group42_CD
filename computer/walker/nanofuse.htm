With the recent reports of electrochemically-induced cold fusion of
deuterium has come reexamination of other mechanisms that have been
claimed to or might theoretically induce fusion, in addition to the
gravitational, magnetic, and inertial confinement routes which are
well-researched.

<p>
One little-known mechanism that may be worth of study, particularly if
one anticipates the advent of atomic-level fabrication of mechanisms,
is the phenomenon of ``piezofusion.'' Experiments have detected
neutron emission consistent with d-d fusion when a crystal of lithium
deuteride is fractured [Klyuev86].  This is believed to be the
consequence of deuterons being accelerated by KEv electric fields
generated by a propagating crack in the crystal.  This can be thought
of as the subatomic analogue of crunching wintergreen Life Savers in
the dark.

<p>
If real, this observation suggests that mechanically compressing
atoms, particularly when mechanical advantage can be employed in
conjunction with an electric field, might induce fusion.  If a
randomly propagating crack in a crystal can cause fusion, how much
more effective a job would a molecular-scale machine, designed to grab
atoms of deuterium, neutralise their electron shielding, and mash them
together in the manner of a diamond anvil press, which on a desktop
can generate some of the highest pressures ever created in the
laboratory?

<p>
If we could fabricate a nanomachine with an covalently bound backbone,
employing mechanical advantage to induce fusion, we might be able to
build an ``atom masher,'' which would release energy by fusion under
benign conditions.  Whether the energy released by fusion interactions
would destroy the machine and, if so, whether it would exceed the
energy needed to construct the fusion press are many of the secondary
issues that may render the concept fruitless even if it isn't totally
bogus in principle.

<p>
Also worthy of informed speculation is whether atomic-scale
engineering might construct surface or volume-action catalysts which
could increase the number of fusions cataysed by a muon during its
lifetime of 2 microseconds from the 100 or so measured in a mix of
liquid deteurium and tritium to the 100,000 needed to break even
energetically--one imagines fabricating pellets so engineered that
they would emit an energy pulse when bombarded by a muon beam--like
laser-induced pulse inertial confinement but on a tiny, tiny scale.

Molecular catalysis in nuclear transmutation is suggested by one of
the classics of crank biochemistry, <cite>Biological
Transmutations</cite>, C.L. Kervran, 1971.  Anecdotal reports of heavy
metal transmutation in poultry also exist.
