                              What Next?
                The Coming Revolution In Manufacturing

                            by John Walker
               Autodesk Technical Forum -- May 10th, 1990

These are indeed extraordinary times we're living through.

Few  people are lucky enough to live at a time when their chosen field
of interest becomes the center  of  a  technological  revolution  that
changes the face of the world.

We've  all  shared  that  good  fortune; the success of Autodesk in so
short a time is evidence of of how  rapidly  and  how  completely  the
evolution  of computers has changed the way design and engineering are
done and has reshaped the very terrain on which businesses compete.

Yet  all  of  these  remarkable  events  were predictable, at least in
general outline, more than 25 years ago.  I remember, like  yesterday,
the  afternoon in the spring of 1968 when, after I first learned about
the technologies used in the crude integrated circuits of the time, it
hit  me.   There was no fundamental physical reason you couldn't put a
whole computer on a single chip.  It was just a matter of engineering,
money, and time.

Now  I certainly didn't know when it would happen, and I doubt anybody
anticipated price and performance reaching their current  levels,  but
the  direction  and  the  goal  was  clear.   It  made engineering and
economic sense; there  was  no  reason  it  wouldn't  work;  and  each
intermediate  step  along  the  way  would  clearly  pay for itself in
commercially  successful  products.   That   pretty   much   made   it
inevitable.

This  is  the  kind  of  reasoning  I'm  going  to  be  using  in this
presentation--projecting readily predictable trends forward and asking
the question "How far can we go, and what happens when we get there?"

Some of the conclusions that  seem  almost  inevitable  have  profound
consequences   that  are  not  just  interesting,  but  important  for
companies like Autodesk who wish to grow and  prosper  in  the  coming
years.

WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
=====================

Let's  start  by  looking  at  the  key trend that's driven the entire
silicon revolution.  It's really very simple: making  things  smaller,
or in engineer-speak, device scaling.

               As you make a circuit smaller, it:
                     * Goes faster
                     * Uses less power
                     * Costs less

In the early days of transistors, it was observed that when you made a
device smaller, you got the best of everything.   It  ran  faster,  it
used less power and ran cooler, and since you could pack a lot more of
them on a single wafer and the cost of processing a wafer was the same
regardless of what was on it, the price per device went down.

After the first primitive integrated circuits were made  in  the  late
1950s,  the  incentive to miniaturise became even more compelling.  By
reducing the size of devices further, more complex circuitry could  be
packed  onto each chip.  And remember, all chips cost roughly the same
to make, regardless of what they do or how complicated they are.

Integrated  circuits  started out as devices with just two transistors
on a die, and  progressed  to  building  blocks  for  larger  systems.
Finally, in the mid 1970s, practical microprocessors, entire computers
on a single chip, appeared.  These initial devices were  crude,  which
led many observers to dismiss them as toys.  Indeed, none of the major
computer manufacturers of the time played a significant  role  in  the
development of what is now the universal way of making computers.

It  was  the  chip  makers who pioneered microprocessors and developed
them to their current state.  Why?  Because they  were  familiar  with
the  inexorable consequences of device scaling, and they knew how far,
in time, it would carry the microprocessor.

CPU PERFORMANCE
===============

How far have we come?

I have a little program, called the Autodesk Benchmark, that I run  on
various  computers  to get a feel for how fast they'll run engineering
software like AutoCAD.

Here's an anthology of results, spanning the history of Autodesk, from
1982 through the present.

             Run time
             (seconds)       Computer
             =========       ========      
              3466.00     Commodore 128
              1598.00     Macintosh Plus
              1582.13     Marinchip TI 9900 2 Mhz

                 0.31     IBM RS/6000 

In  1982,  personal  computers  were becoming seen as useful tools for
serious work, but they were still very, very slow for  computationally
intensive tasks.  A typical low cost PC such as a Commodore took close
to an hour to run the program.  (Putting this in  perspective,  to  do
the  same  job  by hand with a pocket calculator would probably take a
whole day.)

More expensive and powerful PCs emerged and slowly reduced this  time,
making  more and more complicated tasks practical.  Then, in 1984, the
80286 appeared.  The impact of  this  machine  on  Autodesk  can't  be
underestimated.   Calculations  that took half an hour on the PCs that
existed when we started the company could be done in a minute  on  the
PC/AT.  It's no coincidence that Autodesk's sales took off through the
roof right about that time.

But it didn't stop there.  Three years  later,  workstations  and  PCs
based  on  the  next  generation of chips had cut this time by another
factor of ten--from a minute to about five seconds.

And now the newest, shiniest  crop  of  machines  just  arriving  have
handed  us  another  factor  of twenty--down to less than a third of a
second.

In eight years, we've  seen  a  task  that  originally  took  an  hour
reduced,  by  the simple consequences of device scaling--making things
smaller--to less than a third of a second.

This kind of technological progress is hard  to  comprehend,  even  if
you've  lived  through  it.   If automotive technology had advanced an
equivalent degree, your car that went 55 MPH in 1982  would  today  go
615,000 miles an hour, with the same gas mileage and price.  You could
drive to the Moon in around 25 minutes, if you beat the rush hour  and
had a good radar detector.

So the inevitable question is...just how long can this go on?

There  are  reasons  to  believe  the  end  of progress in electronics
through pure application  of  device  scaling  may  be  within  sight,
although  not  imminent.   When  the  limits  of  device  scaling  are
encountered, the linear extrapolation that  has  driven  our  industry
since the 1950s will come to an end and we'll enter another era.

Before getting into that,  I'd  like  to  talk  about  some  different
perspectives on the kind of exponential growth we've been seeing.

OH WOW

                   |...
                   L_______________________  

The first is what I call the "Oh Wow" view of things.  You look at the
curve and draw the obvious conclusion--it's going to go on climbing to
the sky forever.

Now I don't mean to disparage this view; most people err on  the  side
of  conservatism--they  don't realise just how far a trend can go once
it's set into motion.  But nothing grows forever.

In evaluating any growth trend, whether CPU  performance  at  constant
price,  world population, or Marin County real estate prices, you have
to ask, "what are the fundamental limits to this growth."

OH WELL
=======

                   |           .....
                   |         ..     
                   |        .        
                   |       .          
                   |     ..             
                   |   ..                 
                   |...                      
                   L_________________

This kind of analysis leads to a different perspective I refer  to  as
the  "Oh  Well"  view.   Rather than continued exponential growth, the
trend continues until it begins to encounter limits that constrain it,
then it tapers off after achieving maturity.

This  view  is  very popular among mainstream business analysts since,
especially if you cook up some suitably  bogus  constraints,  you  can
always  justify  cutting  research  and development, reject innovative
market expansion and distribution ideas, and relegate the business  to
a mindless caretaker status once it has reached "maturity".

For  example,  once  you've  sold  a  video  tape recorder to every TV
station, how many more could you possibly sell?

OH SHIT
=======

                   |           ...
                   |         ..   ..
                   |        .       .
                   |       .         .
                   |     ..           ..
                   |   ..               ..
                   |...                   ...
                   L_________________________

Again, we're not seeing the whole picture.  Taking a still longer view
gives us what I call the "Oh Shit" perspective.

Nothing  in  this world is static and nothing, regardless of maturity,
lives forever.  When a technology, or market,  or  species  ceases  to
grow  and  develop,  it's  the strongest possible indication that it's
become  a  dead  end--its  hand  is  played  out--that   decline   and
replacement are only a matter of time.

To understand why, we have to take an even longer perspective.

OH YEAH

     L__________________________________________________________

For  this is what's really happening.  Progress is made in a series of
waves.  Each starts with a giddy period of exponential growth.  That's
when  it's  fun,  when everybody's jumping in, working 24 hours a day,
losing money hand over fist, and having a wonderful time.

As the curve really begins to soar, it starts having an impact on  the
established,   mature  technologies  that  went  before.   This  is  a
general-purpose graph; it's my worldview on a single slide.   You  can
read   it  as  transistors  replacing  vacuum  tubes  and  then  being
supplanted by integrated circuits, or  of  mainframes,  minicomputers,
and   personal   computers,   of   turnkey  mainframe  CAD  companies,
workstation based CAD, and mass market desktop CAD  software,  or  for
that matter of species diversification and extinction in an ecosystem.

It doesn't matter.  It's all evolution in action.

TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS
=========================

I call the points where a rapidly developing technology takes off  and
starts  to displace its predecessor "technological transitions." These
are perilous times, but they are the times when great  industries  are
founded.   Rarely do leaders of the last technology play a significant
role  in  the  next;  they've  usually  become   encumbered   with   a
bureaucratic  superstructure  focused  on managing a mature market but
incapable of acting on the small scale  with  the  rapid  pace  that's
needed  to  develop  its  successor--the  new market that's inexorably
displacing them.

Having grown out of their period of rapid  growth,  they've  forgotten
it's  possible.   They  value caution over the very assumption of risk
that built their industries in the first place, and  through  caution,
they place at risk everything they have.

Technological  transitions  are  great  times to make gobs and gobs of
money.   Autodesk  got  on  board  a  relatively  minor  technological
transition  in  1982--the  second subwave of personal computers, which
was  a  ripple  of  the  microprocessor  surge,  itself  part  of  the
semiconductor   tide,   contained  within  the  automation  industrial
revolution.  Even so, we managed to turn a  hundred  thousand  dollars
into more than a billion in less than eight years.

Just imagine what you could do with a real industrial revolution.

FIVE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS
===========================

Everybody  has  their  own  list of industrial revolutions, and here's
mine.

                    Tools            2,000,000 B.C.
                    Metallurgy            3600 B.C.
                    Steam power           1764
                    Mass production       1908
                    Automation            1946

A couple of million years ago we figured out that bashing things  with
rocks  you'd  worked  into special shapes was better that bonking them
with any old random rock you  picked  up.   Suddenly  you  had  tools,
craftsmanship, carpentry, weapons, wealth beyond imagining, and global
proliferation  of  a  previously  obscure  critter.    This   was   an
information   revolution:   using   knowledge  to  transform  existing
materials into useful forms.

All  of  this was based on natural materials, picked up from the Earth
or taken from plants and animals.  Then, about 5600 years  ago,  on  a
sunny  Thursday  morning,  somebody  figured out how to extract copper
from yucky looking rocks.  Now people had access to new  materials  --
technology  was  no  longer limited by what was lying around; it could
make new substances and build with them.  This led  to  bronze,  iron,
alloys,   alchemy,   chemistry,   and  steel.   This  was  a  material
revolution; enabling new technologies by creating substances not found
in nature.

All  of  industry  until the 18th century was powered by the energy of
human or animal muscles, or natural energy sources like falling  water
and  the wind.  This limited both the scope and scale of what could be
done.   The  advent  of  practical  steam  power  swept   away   these
limitations,   spawning   trains,   steamboats,   satanic  mills,  and
capitalism.  This was an energy revolution.

As the scale of industry grew, economies of scale could be realised by
standardisation   and   interchangeability  of  parts.   These  trends
ultimately led to an entire  industrial  system  focused  around  mass
production  of  largely identical objects.  This is harder to date.  I
use 1908, the date of the  first  automobile  assembly  line,  as  the
milestone  of  mass  production.   Mass  production was essentially an
information revolution: it embodied a uniform set of specifications in
huge  numbers  of  objects,  thereby  reducing their cost so many more
people could afford them than ever before.

I  consider  automation  to  be the most recent industrial revolution.
Until the advent of mechanical, electrical, and  electronic  computers
in  the  twentieth  century, any computation or information processing
required the attention of a human being and necessarily  proceeded  at
the  pace  a  human could work.  The computer revolution, which I date
here from Eniac in 1946, has been an information revolution  that  has
transformed  not  only  the mechanics of industry, how we make things,
but  also  the  structure  of   our   organisations   and   societies.
Ironically,  mass production, an essential precursor of automation, is
becoming less important as the introduction of intelligence throughout
the manufacturing process allows more flexible forms of production.

METRE SCALE
===========

Before  I  get  into  the details of what's about to happen, I want to
make sure we understand the territory.  We're about to discuss  things
that  range in size by a factor of a billion to one, so it's useful to
go over the distance scale so we don't confuse millions  and  billions
the way the politicians do.

Let's start with the measure of all things, a human being.  Humans are
on the order of metres in size, actually closer to two metres, but  we
can  ignore ones and twos when talking about factors of 1000, as we're
about to do.

Most of the history of technology has been built to  this  scale,  and
tended to look something like this.

[GEARS--PRINTING PRESS]

If  an  object has to be assembled by people, in many cases powered by
people, and operated by people, it doesn't make any sense to  make  it
smaller  than people can reasonably use, notwithstanding the design of
modern car stereos.

The size of mechanical parts is governed by the materials that compose
them and the scale of the  machines  used  to  fabricate  them.   Both
imposed  severe  limitations  on  miniaturisation  throughout  most of
history, limitations that were surmounted only with  great  difficulty
and expense when absolutely necessary, as in the design of watches.

Wherever  technology  leads  us,  effective  design at this scale will
remain important as long as humans use  the  products.   This  is  the
domain of user interface and ergonomics.

METRES TO MILLIMETRES
=====================

If  we  shrink  down  by  a  factor  of  a  thousand, we arrive at the
millimetre scale, where an ant is pretty big stuff.  (The thing on the
right  of  the  slide is supposed to be an ant, OK?) This is about the
limit of what the human eye can effectively see unaided, or the  human
body   can   manipulate  without  mechanical  assistance,  so  it's  a
convenient milestone on the road to Lilliput.

(TUBE)

Here's an example of millimetre scale technology.  This, for those  of
you  too  young  to  remember  or  old  enough  to have had enough bad
experiences and deliberately forgotten, is a vacuum tube.

If you examine this device closely, you'll see  that  its  fundamental
geometry: the spacing of its grid wires, the distance from the cathode
to the  plate,  are  all  on  the  order  of  millimetres.   With  the
development   of   electronics,   device  scaling  immediately  became
important: the smaller you made a tube, the faster it ran and the less
power it used.  Unfortunately, the fact that tubes had to be assembled
from separate metal parts limited how much you could shrink them.

This particular tube is a 6SN7.  That's the type used in the flip-flop
circuit of the Eniac, the world's first electronic digital computer of
1946.  Each tube, along with a handful of other parts, stored one  bit
of  computer memory--RAM.  The Eniac contained 18,000 tubes like this,
occupied 3000 cubic feet of  space,  and  required  140  kilowatts  of
electricity.  It had about the computing power of a pocket calculator.
It was a miracle of millimetre technology.

Tubes like this aren't even made in the United States any  more;  this
one  came  from  the Soviet Union and cost $13.  Interestingly, that's
almost exactly the current price of an 80 nanosecond 1 megabit dynamic
RAM,  with  a  million  times  the  storage capacity and 125 times the
speed.

MILLIMETRES TO MICROMETRES
==========================

Which brings us to the next factor of 1000 in size, to the  micrometre
range that's the heart of microchip technology.  All of these RAMs and
ROMs  and  microprocessors  have  feature  sizes  on  the   order   of
micrometres.  The entire march of processor technology I showed in the
timing slide is essentially  the  story  of  learning  to  shrink  our
circuits  from the order of tens of micrometres to single micrometres,
and the frontier of electronics in the  next  several  years  will  be
shrinking further, down to fractions of a micrometre.

And then what?

Well, that's a very interesting question.

MICROTEETH
==========

Here's a piece of silicon that's been machined into slabs a third of a
micrometre wide.  This is about the best we  can  do  right  now  with
conventional  processing technology, and to give an indication of just
how tiny that is, each of those slabs is smaller than  the  wavelength
of deep violet light.

Needless  to  say,  this  image is from an electron microscope, not an
optical one.

All the way down to micrometres, we've been able  to  design  circuits
essentially  the  way  we  did  in the days of vacuum tubes.  Yes, the
devices and fabrication technologies changed, but  the  rules  of  the
game like Ohm's law remained the same.

Somewhere between half a micrometre and a tenth of a micrometre, these
comfortable assumptions begin to  break  down.   The  weird  world  of
quantum  mechanics,  where  the  wave  nature  of the electron becomes
apparent, begins to become manifest at this scale and  straightforward
shrinking doesn't seem likely to work.

This  suggests  we're  already uncomfortably near the top of the curve
for conventional electronics.

MICROMETRES TO NANOMETRES
=========================

But how far are we from the theoretical bottom?

Just about another factor of a thousand, it turns out.

If we shrink from a micrometre to a thousandth of that,  a  nanometre,
we've  reached  the  scale where atoms become tangible objects.  A one
nanometre cube of diamond has 176 atoms in it.

Designing  at  this  scale  is  working  in  a  world  where  physics,
chemistry,  electrical  engineering, and mechanical engineering become
unified into an integrated field.

This field will be called molecular engineering, and I believe it will
be at the heart of the next two industrial revolutions.

PLENTY OF ROOM
==============

    The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not  speak
    against  the  possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom.
    ...it is interesting that it would be, in principle, possible
    (I   think)  for  a  physicist  to  synthesize  any  chemical
    substance that the chemist writes down.  Give the orders, and
    the  physicist synthesizes it.  How?  Put the atoms where the
    chemist says, and so you make the substance.
                                          --Richard Feynman, 1959

Over thirty years ago Richard Feynman pointed out that physicists knew
no limits to prevent us from doing engineering at the level of  atoms.
His words are as true today as the day he spoke them.

Until recently, though, while the lack of physical limits was accepted
as commonplace, molecular engineering was thought of  as  impractical,
unnecessary,  or  requiring  breakthroughs  in knowledge and technique
that placed it somewhere in the distant future.

Many visionaries intimately familiar with the development  of  silicon
technology still forecast it would take between 20 and 50 years before
molecular engineering became a  reality.   This  is  well  beyond  the
planning horizon of most companies.

But recently, everything has begun to change.

WRITING WITH ATOMS
==================

In  1981,  Gerd  Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer of the IBM Zurich Research
Laboratory invented the Scanning Tunneling Microscope.   This  device,
easily  one  of  the  most elegant and unanticipated inventions of the
century, allowed imaging of  individual  atoms,  and  won  Binnig  and
Rohrer the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1986.

In  1985, Binnig and Christoph Gerber of IBM Zurich, along with Calvin
Quate of Stanford, invented the atomic force microscope.  This allowed
imaging  nonconductive  matter  such  as  living  cells  to  molecular
(although not currently atomic) resolution.

Since then, every year has seen new inventions in the rapidly  growing
field  of  scanning  probe  microscopes.   They're now imaging bits on
magnetic surfaces, measuring temperature  at  microscopic  sites,  and
monitoring the progress of chemical reactions.

Recently,  IBM  San  Jose  used a scanning tunneling microscope to, in
Feynman's words, put the atom right where the chemist says.

Here's a picture of xenon atoms on a nickel crystal, lined up in a row
by pushing them into place with an STM tip.  Remember, those bumps are
individual atoms, and they've been moved precisely into position, in a
row, one half nanometre from each other.

IBM
===

You can not only put atoms right where the chemist wants them, you can
put them right where the marketing department says to, as well.

Here,  from  the same paper, is a sequence of pictures showing a bunch
of randomly positioned xenon atoms being aligned to spell out the name
of the sponsor.

Again,  each dot in this picture is a single atom, and the letters are
5 nanometres tall.

X
=

Here's an illustration from a paper published a few weeks  before  the
IBM  result.  The bottom picture shows an X drawn with an atomic force
microscope on material adsorbed onto a zeolite crystal surface.  The X
is 8 nanometres tall, and it remained intact for the 45 minutes it was
monitored after being drawn there.

This experiment was done with a desktop instrument no bigger  or  more
complicated than a compact disc player.

MOLECULAR ENGINEERING
=====================

                Molecular Engineering (Nanotechnology)

    ...thorough  control  of  the  structure  of  matter  at  the
    molecular  level.   It entails the ability to build molecular
    systems with atom-by-atom precision, yielding  a  variety  of
    nanomachines.   These  capabilities are sometimes referred to
    as molecular manufacturing.
                                          --K. Eric Drexler, 1989

So  what  we're  talking about is making the next big jump to building
systems a thousand times smaller than the ones we're making today;  to
go  all the way to the bottom and start working with individual atoms.

This is called molecular engineering, or nanotechnology.  Eric Drexler
defines  this  as  control of the structure of matter at the molecular
level, however achieved.

Technology has never had this kind of  precise  control;  all  of  our
technologies  today  are  bulk  technologies.   We take a big chunk of
stuff and hack away at it until we're left with the object we want, or
we  assemble  parts from components without regard to structure at the
molecular level.  Precise atomic level fabrication has previously been
done only by living biological organisms.  We are entering an era when
some of the barriers between engineered and living systems will  begin
to fall.

NEURON
======

In  fact, we're already building components on the scale of biological
systems.  The picture on the left shows a  neuron  net  from  a  human
brain  with  an  integrated circuit component inset at the same scale.
The picture on the right is  a  synapse--the  interconnection  of  the
wiring in the human brain, with a one micrometre scale.  Remember that
this is just about the feature size of the  wires  in  our  integrated
circuits.

The  huge  difference  in capability between engineered and biological
systems is not just the materials from which they're made,  it's  that
the  fine  structure of the integrated circuit stops with what you can
see: there's nothing down below.  Since we're forced to fabricate  our
circuits  from  bulk  material,  from  the  top  down,  they  must  be
essentially two-dimensional.  Biology builds its structures  from  the
bottom up, at the molecular level, and in three dimensions.

Engineers are beginning to learn how to do this.

MANY CHALLENGES
===============

                   ...But Many Paths to Follow

                Biochemistry: Custom protein design
                Chemistry:    Molecular recognition
                Physics:      Scanning probe microscopy
                Computing:    Molecular modeling
                Engineering:  Molecular electronics
                Engineering:  Quantum electronic devices
                Engineering:  Nanocomposites

The  challenges  in  scaling  another  factor  of  1000  shouldn't  be
minimised.  Developing millimetre  scale  electronics  and  micrometre
scale  integrated  circuits wasn't easy, either, but after we overcame
the initial obstacles, both progressed much faster  and  further  than
anybody initially expected.

The remarkable thing about molecular engineering is that it looks like
there are many different ways to get there and, at the  moment,  rapid
progress is being made along every path--all at the same time.

In  1988,  a  group  at  duPont  led by William deGrado designed a new
protein, called Alpha-4 from scratch, and  manufactured  it  in  their
laboratory.   This  protein,  which  never  existed in nature, is more
stable than natural proteins its size.  Researchers around  the  world
are  now  looking  at proteins as molecular structures they can design
and build, just as an IC designer lays out a chip.

Chemists are making progress in designing and  synthesising  molecules
that  bind to other molecules at specific sites, facilitating the kind
of self-assembly that occurs in biology.   The  1987  Nobel  Prize  in
chemistry was awarded for just such work.

I've  already  alluded  to the feats accomplished so far with scanning
probe microscopes.  We now have a tool  that  lets  us  see  and  move
individual  atoms.   STMs  have  also  been used to pin molecules to a
substrate and break molecular bonds.  John  Foster  of  IBM  and  Eric
Drexler  have  suggested  in  a  recent paper in Nature that attaching
custom molecules to  the  tip  of  a  scanning  microscope  may  allow
assembling  objects  with  up  to 10,000 molecular pieces, with atomic
precision.

The ability to model and simulate complex molecular systems  has  been
growing  rapidly  in  recent  years,  driven  both  by advances in raw
computing power, but also by  the  development  of  better  simulation
techniques  that now permit modeling of proteins composed of thousands
of atoms.

Physicists and electrical  engineers  are  making  rapid  progress  in
fabricating electron devices that work at the molecular level.  In the
past  two  years,  Texas  Instruments  and  Bell  Labs  have  reported
molecular-scale  quantum transistors and have fabricated quantum wires
with X-ray lithography.  These quantum wires are on the  order  of  30
nanometres wide.

Materials  scientists  and  mechanical  engineers  are fabricating new
materials called "nanocomposites," made  up  of  individual  particles
ranging  from  100 to 1000 atoms.  These appear to have electrical and
mechanical properties unlike any other engineering materials  and  may
prove useful in the near future.

STEPS: MOLECULAR ELECTRONICS
============================

            * Speed: 1000 Ghz (100--1000 times present)
            * Power: (100--1000 times less power)
            * Compatible with photonics

Even technologies with enormous potential can lie dormant unless there
are significant payoffs along the way to  reward  those  that  pioneer
them.   That's  one  of  the  reasons integrated circuits developed so
rapidly; each advance found an immediate market willing  to  apply  it
and enrich the innovator that created it.

Does molecular engineering have this kind of payoff?  I think it does.

Remembering that we may be less than 10 years away  from  hitting  the
wall  as  far  as  scaling  our  existing electronics, a great deal of
research is presently going on in the area of  molecular  and  quantum
electronics.   The  payoff is easy to calculate; you can build devices
1000 times faster, more energy efficient, and cheaper than those we're
currently using--at least 100 times better than exotic materials being
considered to replace silicon when it reaches its limits.

BACTERIORHODOPSIN OPTICAL MEMORY
================================

      * Purple membrane from Halobacterium Halobium
      * Bistable red/green switch
      * In protein coat at 77K, 10^7--10^8 cycles
      * 10,000 molecules/bit
      * Switching time, 500 femtoseconds
      * Monolayer fabricated by self-assembly
      * Speed currently limited by laser addressing

As an example of current work, consider the molecular  optical  memory
research  underway  by  Prof.   Robert Birge and his group at Syracuse
University.   Using   the   purple   membrane   from   the   bacterium
Halobacterium  Halobium,  they've  made  a  working  optical  bistable
switch, fabricated in a  monolayer  by  self-assembly,  that  reliably
stores  data  with 10,000 molecules per bit.  The molecule switches in
500 femtoseconds--that's 1/2000 of a nanosecond, and the actual  speed
of  the  memory is currently limited by how fast you can steer a laser
beam to the correct spot on the memory.

BACTERIORHODOPSIN AD
====================

Lest you think this is some far out  distant  future  research  topic,
here's  an  ad  from  a  couple weeks ago by a company in West Germany
offering  bacteriorhodopsin  for  sale,  listing  under  applications,
"Optical  data  processing,  optical switches, holography, information
processing, nonlinear optics, and light sensors."

SIXTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
===========================

                      MOLECULAR ENGINEERING

         * Fine-grain control over the structure of matter
         * Materials inaccessible through bulk processing
         * 100 times smaller (at least)
         * 10,000 times cheaper (at least)
         * 1000 times faster (at least)
         * Fabrication of quantum devices

And so, we can begin to see  the  outlines  of  the  sixth  industrial
revolution:  moving  from  micrometre scale devices to nanometre scale
devices.  Current progress suggests the revolution may  happen  within
this decade, perhaps starting within five years.

Neither  the  events nor their consequences will be subtle.  Suddenly,
we'll acquire new capabilities comparable to those of  electronics  or
computers.

What  can  we  make  with  it?  Well, anything we can design and model
that's built of atoms.  Think  about  that.   And  that  includes  the
essential  component  of  the  industrial revolution that will follow,
perhaps in the same year.

SEVENTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
=============================

                      REPLICATING MACHINES

          * Molecular engineering a prerequisite
          * Required to mass-produce at the atomic scale
          * Existence proof

For once we've mastered the essential technology of  life,  assembling
objects  at  the  molecular  level with molecular machines, there's no
reason we can't rapidly exploit the central trick  of  life  as  well:
getting  the  job  done  with machines that make copies of themselves.

Mass production has reshaped our  industries,  lives,  economies,  and
societies,  but it's been a limited form of mass production: one where
the process of production was explicitly designed and rigidly oriented
to making a given object.

Once we can build molecular machines, we can design machines that make
copies of themselves.  By doing so we achieve the second level of mass
production:  being  able  to  make  anything  we  can design at a cost
fundamentally constrained only by the  materials  and  information  it
contains.

If this seems absurd, just imagine how an engineer at the start of the
twentieth  century  would   have   reacted   to   a   description   of
photolithography,  the  technology  we  now  use  to  make  integrated
circuits and printed circuit  boards.   "You're  telling  me  you  can
manufacture  objects  in  the  millions  just by making photographs of
them?  Give me a break!"

In fact, if we want to make objects on the metre scale with  molecular
engineering,  we're going to have to design replicating machines.  The
vacuum tube I showed you has about 10^23 atoms in it, and if  you  try
to  build something that large atom by atom, it's going to take pretty
long.  If you add an atom every second, it'll take 10^23 seconds which
is  a  real  problem  because  that's  a million times longer than the
current age of the universe.  But,  if  you  can  get  your  molecular
machines  to  crank  out  copies of themselves, you can set up a chain
reaction that can  generate  numbers  on  that  scale  quite  rapidly.
That's  how biology manufactures bacteria, butterflies, and buffaloes,
and it works very well.

This is  flexible  manufacturing  taken  to  the  logical  limit.   An
invention  made  on  Monday could, by the following Friday, be in mass
production, with billions of copies  fabricated.   It's  the  ultimate
triumph  of  information over machinery, of software over hardware, of
intellect over capital.

The consequences of this  are  truly  hard  to  grasp.   Just  as  the
development  of  computers  made many problems that have vexed mankind
for centuries essentially trivial, we're looking  here  at  the  first
fundamental  change in the means of production in the last two million
years.  Our economic  and  societal  structures  have  evolved  around
assumptions  that will no longer be valid once technology reaches this
milestone.  And it may happen in the next ten years.

But the real question I haven't answered yet is this.  "Is it actually
possible  to make these little tiny machines out of atoms and then get
them to replicate themselves, or this all just a  pile  of  hooey,  as
ridiculous  as,  say,  putting  16  million  transistors on a piece of
silicon the size of your fingernail?"

PHAGE T4 FOLDED
===============

Let's look at how we might design such a  machine.   Here's  a  little
gadget  that  looks like a lunar lander, but considerably smaller.  It
stands about 225 nanometres high.  This device is designed to  operate
within  a  living system, to seek out cells of a particular type, land
on them by extending its landing legs, then inject them with  material
stored in the tank at the top.

You could design something like this, for example, to locate cancerous
cells in a human body and kill them.

PHAGE T4 LANDED
===============

Here's our little machine attached to a cell, with its injector  poked
through  the  cell  membrane  and  emptying  the  tank into the cell's
interior.

For a sense of scale, this entire gadget, standing on  its  tippy-toes
would  be  less  than  a quarter the size of the smallest feature of a
current microprocessor integrated circuit.

Could something like this be built?

Could it possibly work?

PHAGE T4 SEM
============

Yes.  Here's a scanning electron  microscope  picture  of  the  actual
device.   It  wasn't  designed  on a CAD system; it evolved in nature.
It's called bacteriophage T4.   It's a virus that preys on E. Coli,  a
common bacterium that lives in the human intestine.

So  molecular  devices  exist,  work,  and even succeed in replicating
themselves in a proper environment.

PHAGE F2 SEM
============

Here's an electron micrograph of some E.   coli  cells  infected  with
another virus, phage f2.  The crystalline lattice in the corner of the
cell is an array of self-assembled copies of the  virus,  manufactured
within the cell.

You might also ask, "Can we store information at the molecular level?"

DNA SEM
=======

The answer to this is also yes, and each of us is living proof.

Here's a picture of a molecular-level file copy operation in progress.
This is a 140,000 times blow-up of a strand  of  messenger  RNA  being
transcribed  into  the  proteins  it encodes by a bunch of ribosomes--
they're the little beads on the string  of  RNA.   The  bumpy  strings
coming  out  the  sides  are the protein chains being assembled by the
ribosomes.  Each ribosome is  a  little  molecular  machine  about  20
nanometres  across  that  manufactures  proteins to order by reading a
tape called messenger RNA and  assembling  the  protein  it  describes
according to the genetic code.

There  are quadrillions of them busy at work in each of your bodies at
this very moment,  and  they're  about  as  accurate  in  copying  the
molecular data in your DNA as a typical hard disc drive.

Since these biological molecular machines obviously exist, and clearly
work, and since biology follows the same laws of physics and chemistry
we apply as engineers, there's no question our molecular machines will
work.  All we have to do is figure out how to design and build them.

And   with   the   rapid  progress  on  all  fronts  toward  molecular
fabrication, design may become the most important part of the puzzle.

THE ARGUMENT FOR DESIGN
=======================

The  consequences  of  any industrial revolution extend far beyond the
domain of scientists and technologists.  Indeed, they are difficult to
even  imagine.  For example, try to envision the present world without
any electronic devices.  You can't.  Nobody can.  It would be  a  very
different world from ours.

Similarly,  the  world that will develop after the next two industrial
revolutions is difficult to imagine starting from today, but there  is
every reason to believe the consequences of molecular engineering will
be even more profound in  every  way  that  those  that  followed  the
development of electronics or computers.

One   thing,   however,  is  clear.   Unlike  all  of  the  industrial
revolutions that preceded it, molecular engineering  requires,  as  an
essential  component,  the  ability  to  design,  model,  and simulate
molecular structures using computers.

Computer aided design has been largely an adjunct  to  engineering  so
far.   It  has  promised  productivity  gains, cost savings, and other
benefits but except at the leading edge, as in VLSI design, has rarely
been an indispensable component of the design process.

But  with  molecules,  if  you  can't  model  it,  you can't build it.
Computer  aided  molecular  design  is  one  of   the   key   enabling
technologies  of  these imminent industrial revolutions, and stands to
benefit both by helping to bring them about, and to  profit  from  the
fruits of their success.

A  computer  aided  design  company  that  comprehends, throughout the
organisation, what is about to happen and takes the  small,  cautious,
prudent  steps  today to position itself to ride this next wave stands
an excellent chance of emerging as one of the dominant  industries  on
the   planet   as   molecular   engineering   supplants   our  present
technological  base  to  the  degree  that  integrated  circuits  have
replaced vacuum tubes and electricity has displaced steam engines.

"Leverage" is commonly used these days in a financial  sense  to  mean
risk/reward  amplification  through the assumption of debt.  But there
are many kinds of leverage.  Technological leverage, the power born of
knowledge,  is  supreme among all forms.  We used it to build Autodesk
into the company it is today, fending off competitors  with  far  more
money  and  people  by  simply  knowing where technology had to go and
hitching a ride.

Autodesk is, at this moment, the preeminent global force  in  computer
aided design.  Around the world, technology is poised at the threshold
of access to capabilities scarcely imagined a decade ago, and computer
aided  design  is  an  essential component of this next chapter in the
human adventure.  The technological leverage of this  next  industrial
revolution is ours, if we want it.

The  lever  pivots on the micrometre technology of the microprocessor.
At one end, we reach to grasp it with our metre scale human hands,  at
the  other,  it  manipulates  atoms  to  designs  born  of  the  human
imagination.  With this lever, and the knowledge, courage, and  vision
to operate it wisely, we can truly move the world.
