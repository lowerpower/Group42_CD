<h2>Fly's Eye</h2>

The University of Utah operates
a cosmic ray detector called the Fly's
Eye II, situated at the Dugway Proving Ground about an hour's drive
from Salt Lake City.  The Fly's Eye consists of an array of telescopes
which stare into the night sky and record the blue flashes which
result when very high energy cosmic rays slam into the atmosphere.
From the height and intensity of the flash, one can calculate the
nature of the particle and its energy.
<p>
On the night of October 15, 1991, the Fly's Eye
detected a proton with
an energy of 3.2±0.9×10^20 electron volts.[1,2] By comparison, the
recently-canceled Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) would have
accelerated protons to an energy of 20 TeV, or 2×10^13 electron
volts--ten million times less.  The energy of the Oh My God particle
seen by the Fly's Eye is equivalent to 51 joules--enough to light a 40
watt light bulb for more than a second--equivalent, in the words of
Utah physicist
Pierre Sokolsky,
to "a brick falling on your toe." The
particle's energy is equivalent to an American baseball travelling
fifty-five miles an hour.
<p>
All evidence points to these extremely high energy particles being
protons--the nuclei of hydrogen atoms.  Recalling that the rest mass
of the proton is 938.28 MeV--roughly 1 GeV, 1×10^9 eV, all of the rest
of the particle's energy results from the kinetic energy resulting
from its motion, which we can calculate according to basic formulae of
special relativity.  So let's crunch a few numbers.

<h2>Microbial Mass</h2>

First  of  all,  noting  that  mass  and energy are equivalent, we can
calculate the rest mass equivalent of a 3×10^20 eV particle to be
about 5×10^-13 grams.  That doesn't sound like much until you recall
that this is about 3×10^11 daltons (chemists measure molecular mass in
daltons, where 1 dalton is the mass of a hydrogen atom), just about
the same as a single cell of the intestinal bacterium <em>E. coli</em> (5×10^11
daltons).  Thus this single subatomic particle had a mass-energy
equivalent to a bacterium.

<h2>How Fast?</h2>

How fast was it going?  Pretty fast.  The total mass-energy of a
particle is given in special relativity by the equation:
<p>
<pre>
             M_0
    M  = ------------                                               [1]
                  v²
         Sqrt[1 - --]
                  c²
</pre>
<p>
where M_0 is the particle's rest mass, 0, v is the particle's
velocity, and c is the speed of light.  Okay, we know that the Oh My
God proton has a rest mass of about 1 GeV, and a total kinetic energy
of 3×10^20 eV, so let's solve equation [1] for v, setting c to 1 to
obtain velocity as a fraction of the speed of light:
<p>
  v = Sqrt[m² - M_0²] / m
<p>
And thus, approximately:
<p>
  v = 0.9999999999999999999999951 c
<p>
So taking 3×10^8 metres per second as the speed of light, we find that
the particle was traveling 2.9999999999999999999999853×10^8 metres per
second, thus 1.467×10^-15 metres per second slower than light--one and
a half <em>femtometres per second</em> slower than light.  If God's
radar gun is slightly out of calibration, this puppy's gonna be doin'
hard time for speeding.  After traveling one light year, the particle
would be only 0.15 femtoseconds--46 nanometres--behind a photon that
left at the same time.

<h2>Quicktime</h2>

Recall also that time passes more slowly in a moving reference frame,
by the factor:
<p>
<pre>
             t0
    t = ------------
                 v²
        Sqrt[1 - --]
                 c²
</pre>
<p>
Since we know v/c, we can immediately calculate:
<p>
<pre>
    t
    -- = 3.197×10^11
    t0
</pre>
<p>
and thus, moving in the reference frame of the particle, time passes
<em>three hundred billion times</em> slower than  in  a  rest  frame.   Thus,
given  that  the particle travels with essentially the speed of light,
an observer traveling along  with  the  particle  would  perceive  the
flight time from the following objects to the Earth.
<p>
<pre>
                        Distance[3]       Perceived
 Object               (light years)      Travel Time
===============    ==================    ===========
Alpha Centauri                   4.36    0.43 milliseconds
Galactic nucleus            32,000       3.2 seconds
Andromeda galaxy         2,180,000       3.5 minutes
Virgo cluster           42,000,000       1.15 hours
Quasar 3C273         2,500,000,000          3 days
Edge of universe    17,000,000,000         19 days
</pre>
<p>
Thus, if you could accelerate yourself to the speed at which the Oh My
God particle was traveling, you'd be able to travel to the edge of the
visible universe in a couple of weeks.  Unfortunately, even assuming
you found a source for the energy it would take and invented a means
to accelerate yourself and Intergalactic Vessel <em>Omega Point</em>
to this velocity, you wouldn't get far before being disrupted into
subatomic goo due to interactions with photons in the ubiquitous
cosmic microwave background radiation.  Sokolsky has calculated that
at 3×10^20 eV, even a single proton could travel no farther than 10
megaparsecs, about the distance of the Virgo galaxy cluster, before
losing energy in this manner.

<h2>Warp Factor Oh-My-God--Engage!</h2>

It is interesting to observe that a real particle, in our universe,
subject to all the laws of physics we understand, is a rather better
interstellar voyager than the best fielded in the 24th century by the
United Federation of Planets.  Their much-vaunted Galaxy Class
starships are capable of speeds slightly in excess of Warp Factor 9,
an apparent velocity of 1516 cochranes (or 1516 times the speed of
light).[4]  At a velocity of 1516 c, traveling to the centre of the
galaxy would take, as perceived by the life forms on board, a little
more than 21 years.  By contrast, an observer on board the Oh-My-God
particle would arrive at the nucleus of the Milky Way, according to
his clock, just about 3 seconds after leaving Starbase Terra.  That's
more than 9,700,000 times faster than the starship.  In the time the
starship spends vacuum-whooshing and rumbling its way to the nearby
star Aldebaran, the particle could travel to the edge of the visible
universe.

<h2>Go Fast--Grow Thin</h2>

Finally, let's consider the length contraction in the direction of
motion which results from the Lorentz transformation--objects in the
direction of travel are seen to contract in that direction by a factor
of:
<p>
<pre>
   l             v²
   -- = Sqrt[1 - --]
   l0            c²
</pre>
<p>
And thus, paralleling the time dilation calculated above, in the frame
of the particle, oncoming objects are seen as contracted by a factor
of 3×10^11, three hundred billion times, in thickness.  Thus, seen
from the particle, the objects below will have the following
thickness.
<p>
<pre>
    Object              Rest Frame Thickness    Particle Frame Thickness
================        ====================    ========================
Earth's diameter            12,756 km                  0.0399 mm
Solar system                  80 AU                   37 metres
Sun/Alpha Centauri        4.3 light years            127 km (79 miles)
Milky Way galaxy          30 kiloparsecs          2,895,000 km, about
                                                 ten times the distance
                                                from the Earth to the Moon
</pre>

<h2>But How?</h2>

How was such an extraordinary particle created?  What cosmic process
accelerated a mundane proton to a brick-on-the-toe-energy?
<p>
Nobody knows.  A particle with such energy would be deflected little
by galactic magnetic fields, and so its impact track should point
right back at the source.
Astronomers see nothing unusual in that
direction.
<p>
Nature remains rich in mysteries.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

These calculations involve some elementary but easy to mess up
algebra and some very demanding numerical calculations for which
regular IEEE double precision is insufficient.  If you'd like to
double-check these results, be sure to use a multiple precision
calculator with at least 30 significant digits of accuracy.  I
generally use Mathematica for
symbolic work and Mark Hopkins' package C-BC for number crunching.
It's entirely possible I've made one or more mistakes of
order-of-magnitude or greater significance.  But even so, (and please
correct me!), this is, particle physics wise, a genuine Oh Wow event.
