
The following text is an important update in the lucretive world of carding.
This should be used as a suppliment .TXT file to other philes about this
practice. Before attempting anything discussed here or in any other .TXT file,
please be sure and gather as much information as possible before attempting to
do it yourself. Uneducated people get BUSTED. I oppolagize for using the same
title as Renegade Legion's phile of the same agenda by The Knight, but I
couldnt think of anything more appropriet.

1. Where to get a card.

        Well, that all depends on how knowledged you are with todays
        data-base systems, or how devious you are a thief. Depending on how
        you acquire your card(s), can vary the percentile you are in for
        the possibilty of getting caught. As in other carding files, you
        should know that you can get card-slide receipts in the trash of
        local businesses or shops that allow customers to purchase items and
        or merchandise with the use of those ever handy MasterCard, Visa, and
        the lower on the totem pole, American Express. You may even find
        Discover or a few others, but once past American Express, there are
        very few options you have to choose from in what you can do with the
        information because they are not widely excepted. Trashing for this
        information is fun. It alows you to get up close and personal with
        the Co. you are trashing, and it leaves open doors of opertunity for
        you to discover various other forms of information that the Co. might
        deal with, or possible things to blackmail people with. The only bad
        point I have against trashing is that ITS TRASH, and it can really
        smell harendous. A much more deveous way to get you card is of course
        through a data-base Co. such as CBI or TRW. While finding a local
        dialup and having the password for it may be a problem, if you are
        serious enough to try all this and be successfull, you WILL meet or
        already know people that have access or can get access to one of
        these systems. If not, please dont go any further, or you risk
        serious harm to yourself and those that take this sport to its
        fullest. I wont go into gaining access to CBI or TRW since they are
        covered in various other .TXT's and this is more of an 'update'
        info-file. Stealing is of course an option, but a silly one. If you
        steal someones card, you would have to use it that day and IMMEDIATELY
        after the theft. A stolen card is notorious for not being usable for
        more than a few hours. And once found by a clerk that checks it to
        be stolen, the authorities are surely not far behind. COUNT ON IT.
        After getting the card, CBI the person. Or get someone with the
        capability. And with the CBI report you have access to the persons
        SSN (social security number) which is usually the key to a successful
        card fraud these days. With the SSN and the card information, you can
        call the card issuing company and change the address and the phone #
        of the original card holder. Change the phone # to a hacked VMB for
        the best results. And of course, change the address to the drop site
        address so the co. you are carding from wont be 'iffy' about sending
        to an alternative address.


2. Finding a drop site.

        Finding a drop site can be really easy or very difficult. It all
        depends on your area, whats available to you, and how resoursefull
        you are. A most commonly used drop site would be the front entrance
        way of an apartment complex. An unknown misconception is using your
        own house or building. A well planned delivery can be accomplished
        right at your door step. This all depends on if you have a
        co-conspiritor that is willing to sign at your door. Of course do
        not have your friend do this by opening your front door. This causes
        too much suspicion. When the doorbell rings, have your friend run
        out the back door and around the house. He can pretend he was doing
        outside and that no one else is home. If not in a house situation,
        wait in an apartment building in viewing distance from the front
        entrance way. Be sure you know the approximate delivory time or you
        may be there all day. If its late, check on it (be sure to have the
        confirmation number handy). When you see the delivory truck pull up,
        leave you friends apartment (if inside) and head out the door.
        Pretend to 'bump' into the delivory person, and get your package. Or
        if you were outside the building, do the same thing, but going in.
        Never let the delivory person help you bring in the packages. Make
        something up, but dont be suspicious about it.

3. Placing the calls.

        News for most people is that alot of mail order companies now have
        ANI capability. Which means that they know where you are making the
        call from. And most will want to call you back. So, when placing a
        call for ordering, do one of the following:

                1. Place the call from a trunk box or from a neighbors line.

                2. Place the call operator assisted (ie. call the operator
                   and ask him/her to place the call for you). This cannot be
                   traced because its not you calling. Its traced back to
                   the operator. If the mail order co. needs a call back #
                   tell them your at work and cant be called back, then give
                   them a hacked VMB # or a BBS #. You can call them back
                   later and explain that you FAX machine was hooked up (if
                   you gave them a BBS number. Besure you have something
                   planned out before making the call.

4. To mail order, or not to mail order.

        Mail ording is nice but doesnt alwasy get you what you want, and
        doesnt always go through. After getting the SSN and other information
        for the card and cardholder, you can change the address and phone #:
        Then after about a week, report the card stolen!  They will issue a
        new card to the address you changed it to. Now you have plastic!
        Plastic is very powerful and get you almost anything you want. If
        your younger, then its great because you can say that daddy gave you
        the card and told you what you could buy with it. Stores dont argue
        with this. You may run into a point where they want to check with
        'your parents'. So be sure and have the card phone # changed to a
        VMB and tell the clerk another # you can reach them at (if they didnt
        like the VMB after calling). Give them 'your parents work #" which
        is really your friend at a payphone waiting for you to get the hell
        out of there and watching for police.


5. Cover your ass.

        Whenever venturing into this possibly dangerous field, be sure you
        have EVERYTHING planned out. And have backup plans!  The smoother
        things are run, the better for everyone involved. The co. you are
        carding from prefers it when things are normal appearing. If things
        look out of place, they flag the card for possible credit fraud and
        notify the issue bank to have it checked.

6. Getting caught.

        Watch out, cause it happens!  Its happened to me, and people around
        me. If the cops are heading your way, RUN!  Drop what you are doing
        and head for the mother fucking hills boy!  You better be a good
        sprinter too. Seriously, be sure and have a getaway planned depending
        on what and where you are carding. If you get caught, cut your losses.
        Dont rat out your friends, but you can give out information on people
        you dont like as a plea bargain!  Just becareful about that because
        what goes around, comes around. Never admit to anything they are try
        to prove that you 'also did' or didnt do. The smaller the $$ amount
        you got caught for, the better. Larceny under $250 is a misdemeanor.
        But larceny over $250 is a fellony. You can check your local law
        books as to what each one can mean to you (call your local police
        department, they'll know. Tell them its for a class your in). It may
        come down to paying fines, or worse depending on a previous record you
        might have or if you get caught for a lot all at once. Be prepared for
        it, because it could happen. Well thought out plans dont fail as long
        as there are backdoors for yourself and co-conspiritors. But if not,
        if you can do the crime, you can do the time, or pay the fine. Most
        companies just want their merchandice back or payment of whatever you
        purchased and they will drop the charges. Thats what happened to
        myself. I paid, and I walked. I made sure that I had money ahead of
        time just for that purpose. And it worked. A month later I resumed,
        and nothing has become of it since. But, dont be scared off because
        "I", the person writing this file got caught. It was a stupid mistake
        on the part of a freind. I wasnt even aware of it till it was too
        late. Figures huh?  Just besure you know of EVERYTHING. If someone
        else is taking care of part of the scam, be sure you know what it is
        and what they did. Besure everyone involved knows everything. That
        way you dont get crossed lines...
