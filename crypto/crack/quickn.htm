<h2>Quicken Password Crack</h2>

Quicken is fairly easy to crack by hand.  Start up a dummy account which
is not password protected, and start it up in a new subdirectory.  Exit
Quicken and copy the files that it created for later comparison.  Then
restart Quicken, enter the dummy account and put a password on it.  Once
you leave Quicken, you can use any number of file comparison utilities
to compare the saved files to the current files and thereby find out where
the password is saved.
<p>
The last time I did that, I found that the password
free account simply had zeroes in the password position.  Removing the
password from a protected set of files was simple (use Norton or even
debug).
