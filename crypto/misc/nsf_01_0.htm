If you want something to stay a secret, don't tell anyone, don't write
it down.  If you do have to send it to someone else, hide it in
another message so that only the right recipient will understand.
Many creative methods of hiding messages have been invented over the
ages,.  Cryptography in the computer age typically involves the
translation of the original message into a new and incomprehensible
one by a mathematical algorithm using a specific "key".  Just like you
need to open the lock on a door with a key, the algorithm and key
protects your the contents of your message from unauthorized access.
<p>

Taking the lock and key model one step further, ease of getting into
the crytographic system depends on the strength of the lock (the
algorithm), and the possession of the key.  For example, you may
encrypt your message by changing every letter to the one <i>n</i>
letters later in the alphabet, i.e., A is changed to B, B to C , and
so on, for <i>n</i>=1.  (This method is known as a substitution cipher
and is reputed to have been used by Julius Caesar.)  Knowing your
algorithm, it's quite easy to reveal your true message by trying each
of the 25 possible values of the key <i>n</i>.
<p>

If we are simply using a trial-and-error approach to discover the key,
the difficulty of breaking the algorithm increases with the number of
possible keys, and with the amount of time it takes to try each key.
However, there may be other approaches that are less time-consuming.
In substitution ciphers, knowlege of the usage frequency of letters in
the language and in the message will indicate the probable
substitutions.  As every English-speaking parent of a child with a
"Speak-and-Spell" toy knows, the "e" key usually wears out first.

<p>

The strength of the algorithm should be independent of the knowledge
of how it works.  Cryptographers also prefer to trust published
algorithms over proprietary ones because this allows the community of
experts to look for systematic weaknesses.  A number of algorithms
that appear impregnable at first have later yielded to specific
techniques of attack.  So the longer an algorithm has remained
unbroken, the stronger it is likely to be.

<p> The other part of the equation is the key itself.  The longer a
key is in use, the more likely someone will be able to discover it,
and the larger the amount of information that would be compromised.
Changing the key frequently, e.g., on a per message basis, therefore
can strengthen the security of the system.

<p>

Cryptographic algorithms come and go, and here are some of the latest.

<p> One of the most widely used encryption algorithms is DES (Data
Encryption Standard).  It was developed by IBM and adopted as an
official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS PUB 46) in
1976.  DES uses a 56-bit key - considered to be just beyond the
technology at the time to break with a brute force approach.  However,
by 1993 a custom computer costing $1 million could theoretically be
built to crack DES by brute force in 7 hours.  In the following year,
a new technique called "linear cryptanalysis" enabled another
researcher to break DES in 50 days on a single workstation, or about
14 MIPS-years assuming a 100 MIPS machine.  Efforts to extend the life
of DES include lengthening the key to 128 bits (still beyond the realm
of computer horsepower today) and "Triple DES", which involves three
passes of encryption and decryption using two different keys.

<p> The RSA algorithm, used in public key cryptography and patented in
the US, is based on the fact that it's easy to multiply two large
prime numbers together, but hard to factor them out of the product.  A
challenge issued in 1977 to factor the key based on a 129 digit number
(or 429 bits) was finally met in 1994 by an international group of
over 600 volunteers and 1500 computers working for 8 months.  The
estimated effort was somewhere between 100,000 amd 1,000,000
MIPS-years.  The decrypted message read, "THE WORDS ARE SQUEAMISH
OSSIFRAGE", starting the tradition of using those words in
key-breaking challenges.

<p> IDEA, International Data Encryption Algorithm, is a new DES-like
algorithm invented in 1991 in Switzerland.  It uses a 128-bit key and
was designed with more mathematical theory than DES.  It is believed
to be a strong algorithm, but no challenge has yet been mounted, and
only time will tell whether it will withstand the attacks of
cryptographers.  IDEA is patented internationally.

<p> RC2 qnd RC4 are two proprietary, DES-like algorithms that allow
variable key lengths.  They were developed by RSA Data Security, Inc,
and are notable for having an exportable version with a limited,
40-bit key size.  The 40-bit RC4 algorithm is used in the
International versions of many software packages including the
Netscape web browser.  In the last week, a French programmer
successfully broke a 40-bit key and decrypted a single secure Netscape
transaction (created as a challenge using data from a hypothetical
Mr. Cosmic Kumquat at 1234 Squeamish Ossifrage Road).  Netscape
estimates that the effort took 64 MIPS-years.

<I>Where do keys come from?</I>

<p> For two people to communicate in encrypted mode, they would have
to arrange the secret key before hand.  Setting up keys presents all
sorts of logistical problems when you are communicating with multiple
people (a separate key may be needed for each), or when you cannot
communicate the key information securely in the first place.  Some
systems get around this by establishing a centralized key authority,
e.g., the US Government, or the key database in a Kerberos system.
However, the invention of public key cryptography changed all that.
Unlike private key or symmetric encryption where a single key is used
for both encryption and decryption, public key (or asymmetric)
encryption uses a public key-private key pair.  The sender encrypts
the message using the published public key, and the recipient reads
the message by decrypting it with the private key.  Public key
directories could be published, just like telephone and other
directories.  However, the use of public key directories presents a
different problem.  Since the key is not prearranged through a trusted
source, how can you be sure the public key belongs to a real and
legitimate person or organization?  All you might have is a
disembodied e-mail address or URL.

<p> There are currently two solutions to the certification issue -
building what is commonly termed a "web of trust", and setting up
official key issuing authorities.  The web of trust works through
personal recommendations.  Your public key is "signed" by other people
who can vouch for you.  If I trust one or more of those people, I
would believe that you are real and legitimate.  The alternative is
institutional, through a Certification Authority (CA).  As states
issue drivers licences or universities issue ID cards, public keys can
be "issued" by an organization that is familiar with the individual
involved, or Certification Authorities.  These CA's in turn derive
their "trust" from thecentral Internet Registration Policy Authority
to form a hierachical organization.

<I>Sometimes signed but never sealed</I>
<p>

E-mail is arguably the most prevalent and important component of
Internet traffic. We tend to think of mail mostly in terms of letters
in sealed envelops.  But mail messages being routed from computer
system to computer system on their journey through the Internet are
more like postcards than letters.  Along the way, a message can be
read, and even more, it can be modified.  E-mail headers are
notoriously easy to forge.  Encrypting the message is one technique to
prevent tampering.  In addition, cryptographic techniques can also be
used to securely "sign" a mail message without encrypting the
message..

<p> In signing a document, a one way hash function is used to reduce
the message to a short, fixed length string of characters (a digest).
The digest is then encrypted with the sender's private key to create a
digital signature.  To verify the signature, the recipient takes the
message and converts it into digest form, and separately decrypts the
sender's signature with the sender's public key.  The results of these
two operations should be identical if the message has not been
tampered with.  In addition, use of the sender's public key to decrypt
the signature also confirms that the message actually came from the
sender.

<p> Common one way hash algorithms include MD2, MD4, and MD5 from RSA
Data Systems, and the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) invented by the NSA
as part of the US government Digital Signature Standard (DSS).

<p> Public key algorithms such as RSA are used in mail encryption
programs.  However, because of the resources required to encrypt
messages with RSA, only a randomly-generated session key is usually
encrypted with RSA.  This session key is used to encrypt the message
with a private key algorithm such as DES.  This approach provides the
added advantage that a different key is used to encrypt each message
that is sent.

<p> PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is the best-known secure mail program
available today.  It was written by Philip Zimmermann and first
released in 1991.  It uses RSA public key cryptography for session key
exchange, and IDEA for message encryption.  Because of US patents
surrounding the RSA algorithm and US export regulations, PGP has had a
colourful history. The result is different versions, not always
compatible with each other, available for use within US/Canada and for
the rest of the world.

<p> PEM, the Privacy-Enhanced Mail standard, is developed as an
Internet mail standard by many of the people who helped create PGP.
The standard is described in RFC 1421-1423, and also includes the
X.509 Key Certification Standard from CCITT.  Originally, it only
allowed a hierarchical key certification organization, however this
has been modified to include the PGP-styled "web of trust" model.
Reference implementations include RIPEM, Riordan's Internet Privacy
Enhanced Mail developed by Mark Riordan, and a version from Trusted
Information Systems, Inc.  RIPEM currently does not support key
certification.

<p> The main difference between PGP and PEM appear to be in the area
of sender privacy.  PGP allows encryption without signing, i.e.,
anonymous, encrypted messages, and PEM does not.  Additionally, the
PEM message signature is outside the encryption envelop, allowing
anyone to verify the sender of the message without reading the
message.

<p> Recently, RSA Data Security and a number of key messaging vendors
have announced support for a new standard for secure MIME messaging
(S/MIME).

<P>
<I>Or is that the other way around?</I>

<p> There is usually a howl of laughter or outrage when cryptographers
or privacy advocates mention that cryptography is considered a
"munition" by the 1954 Munitions Control Act - just like nuclear
missiles .  What is often forgotten is that pivotal battles during
World War II, such as the campaign against Rommel in North Africa, or
the Battle of Midway, relied upon intelligence gleaned by breaking
German and Japanese codes.  In effect, cryptography played as
important or perhaps even more important role compared with such
plebian materiel as cannons or bombs.  Although time has passed,
export of cryptography is strictly regulatd.

<p> But at the same time, the Internet has no natural political
boundaries.  PGP, placed on the Net by an enthusiastic user, quickly
spread to the rest of the world.  The same happened to RSA Data
Security's RSAREF reference code library.  The result is a federal
criminal investigation of Philip Zimmermann.  As the Internet
community comes to grips with dealing with export control, World Wide
Web and FTP sites are creating restrictions and posting advisories to
discourage downloading non-Americans.  More dramatic approaches
include an effort to excise DES encryption out of the Kerberos network
security system.  This bare bones system would then be exportable and
an encryption engine can be reinstalled abroad.

<p> The software industry is acutely aware of the cost of export
control, and is active in lobbying for its reduction or elimination.
The recent quick breaking of the 40-bit key version of RC4 used for
exportable versions of software has simply served to emphasize the
limitations of existing export controls.

<p> Interestingly enough, although computer code cannot be legally
exported, source code in printed form within a book does not seem to
face the same restrictions.  Books containing sample DES
implementations are widely available.  Schneier's "Applied
Cryptography" book can be exported, but not the diskette containing
the same source code as is listed in the book.  One might wonder
whether this is a face-saving compromise along the lines of "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell".

<HR>
<P>
<I>Of microdots, the USS Pueblo, and steganography</I>

<p> An encrypted message looks like gibberish, and alert people that
there is something to hide.  But what if the message is totally
innocuous looking?  This is an old trick that started centuries ago
with writing in ink that is invisible until the paper has been heated.
The microdot, a piece of film containing a very highly reduced image
of the secret message and embedded in the punctuation marks of a
normal document, was invented during World War II.  In the 60's, a
photograph of members of the USS Pueblo released by their captors to
show their cooperation seemed ordinary enough until you looked
carefully at the hanf positions.  They were spelling out the word
"SNOWJOB" in sign language.  And we all remember the hysteria about
finding satanic messages by playing certain recordings backwards.

<p> What if you used the least significant bit of each pixel in a
bitmap image to encode a message?  The impact on the appearance of the
image would not be noticeable.  This is known as steganography, or
covered writing.  A 480 pixel wide by 100 pixel high image - smaller
than many WWW home page banners, could theoretically contain a message
of more than 5,000 characters.  The ecoding is quite easy with a
computer - and no complicated mathematics at all.  And of course the
same principles apply to audio and video files as well. Furthermore,
the image can be used simply as a carrier, with the message being
first encrypted.  So an old trick has found a new, digital dog.

<I>Applied cryptography for a little fun and mostly profit</I>

<p> While mail privacy is an important topic to many, cryptography
also contributes to an area of far greater monetary value: online
commerce.  Public key cryptography enables digital signatures that
verify the authenticity of a document, confirms the authorization of
the sender, and non-repudiation of the transaction - all critical
components to financial transactions.  It contributes in other areas
as well.

<p> Timing is important to many transactions, e.g., tax returns must
be filed by midnight, April 15, in the US, There needs to be a secure
mechanism to timestamp the corresponding electronic documents. Surety
Technologies provides a Digital Notary System that produces electronic
timestamping.  It is based on combining message digests (created as
part of the digital signature process) and timestamp values from a
tamper-proof clock to create "super" messages that can be uniquely
identified.  The contents of the original document need not be
revealed to the timestamp service.

<p> Current trends in electronic payment systems is firmly towards the
development of a stored-value card.  Money is "downloaded" and stored
in an integrated circuit on the card.  This can be for used for any
purchase where cash can be used.  Up to this point, cash has remained
the last anonymous, untraceable method of payment.  With the
capabilities of a "smart" card such as the stored value card, all
"cash" transaction information would also be captured, creating an
associated loss of privacy.  However, we need not lose our privacy to
gain the use of electronic cash.  Dr. David Chaum of Digicash has
created algorithms for "blind signatures" that allow anonymous use of
cash through a smart card mechanism.  Whether this will be adopted by
major card organizations, though, remains an open question.  <p>

Digital signatures can help confirm that the sender of a message is
really who he says he is, but what happens when he doesn't want
someone to know?  Anonymous letters - graffiti, ransom notes, whistle
blowing, etc. have all been around for a long time and often serve a
genuine purpose.  Yet e-mail systems generally persist in recording
and reporting information about the message originator.  To preserve
the anonymity of the sender, "anonymous remailers" have been set up on
the Internet.  Messages sent to these remailers for forwarding have
the originating header stripped off and replaced with the address of
the remailer.  Replies to the remailer are then forwarded back to the
originator without revealing his identity.  While, the best known of
anonymous remailers is Although most people think of anon.penet.fi,
run by Penetic, a company in Finland, there are actually about 20
remailers on the Internet

<p> In using an anonymous remailer, one must always remember that the
remailer is but one part of the system, and that it too is subject to
attacks.  First of all, your mail may go through a number of hops
before reaching the remailer.  Mail can be monitored en route, and
especially at the point of origin.  Even if your message is encrypted,
the knowlege that you are sending mail to an anonymous remailer may be
cause for suspicion.  Traffic analysis of the remailer - tracking
incoming and outgoing mail and their sizes, can review the identity of
seemingly anonymous messages.  There is a variety of techniques to
improve the certainty of anonymity and to defend remailers from
attacks; e.g., by chaining - sending a message through a number of
remailers to the final destination, or by holding mail a random amount
of time to deter traffic analysis.  However, not all attacks are
technical.  In February, the Church of Scientology was able to obtain
the identity of one user of anon.penet.fi by a criminal complaint
throu gh Interpol and the Finnish police authorities.  Protecting
privacy is a step removed from shielding criminal activity.

<I>The gusher from the data strata</I>

<p> During the 1972 US Presidential Elections, the McGovern campaign
found that one of its best sources of campaign contributions came from
a list of Volvo owners.  The discovery was serendipitous, but in the
intervening years, computer technology has grown to the point of
playing a vital role in identifying these kinds of trends and
patterns.  And increasing computerization means that far more
information is being kept in electronic databases amenabale to
efficient searches and correlations.  Database marketing, or database
drilling, is now a standard part of the marketer's repertoire.  It has
plenty of data to work on, from credit card transactions to
subscriptions and mailing lists, and even the government gets in the
act by selling information such as name, address, and driver's license
number.

<p> At the same time, the ability to link information in different
databases - education and driving records, credit history, health,
spending patterns, etc. - is no further away than a unique ID number.
Most countries have some form of ID system for its citizens; the US
has the social security number (SSN).  Although the SSN was explicitly
intended not to be a national ID number, practically it is used by
many organizations for idenification purposes.  The result of even
partial linking of records would be an incredibly detailed history of
our lives - after all, it's a mere matter of programming, and not
complicated programming at that.

<I>Cipper sightings on the Internet sea</I>

<p> Despite the mountains of data that accumulate about our highly
computerised lives, the ability to (get a court order) and listen in
to the conversations of Americans has always been a cherished tool by
law enforcement agencies.  The rise of digital telephony and
telecommunications and cryptography threatened to put an end to that.
The government's response was to propose the Capstone program.  The
key piece was the Clipper chip.  Incorporated into all telephones and
other such devices, this would permit encrypted communications through
the use of the "Skipjack" algorithm.  Except the device is built with
a "Law Enforcement Access Field" (LEAF).  Given a court order, the law
enforcement agency could go to key escroll centers with the field
information and obtain the keys necessary to decrypt the conversation.

<p> The outcry from this announcement was loud and long.  The Skipjack
algorithm. classified and implemented in hardware, did not allow the
cryptographic community to examine and test its strength.  Worse, many
were afraid that the algorithm contained a trapdoor that would allow
decryption without the escrolled keys.  Others thought that Clipper
marked the beginnings of an attempt to outlaw cryptography.  The irony
was that upon closer examination, Dr. Matt Blaze of Bell Labs
discovered a way to create a bogus LEAF and thus make decryption by
the authorities impossible.

<p> With that, the Clipper chip subsided into oblivion.  However, in
the last week, the Clinton Administration has indicated that it will
soon propose a "son of Clipper" - and hinted at allowing
non-government escroll centers.  In the interval, the programming
community had not been idle.  Nautilus, an encrypted phone system
running on PC's and communicating through the Internet was introduced
in the spring. (The name Nautilus comes from the submarine that sank
clipper ships in the Jules Verne classic "20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea".)  Philip Zimmermann has just announced PGPFone, a similar system
running on Macintoshes.

<I>It's eleven o'clock at night.  Do you know what your software is doing?</I> 
<P>

First came the programs that helped us to write letters and
spreadsheets on our personal computers.  Then came the insidious
little viruses - hiding inside other programs that did everything from
wishing us "Have a nice day" to wiping out our hard drives.  Well,
whatever they did, they stayed within the confines of our computers.
Then we got online services - our PC's started to communicate with the
service mainframe at the other end of the phone line in a
client-server fashion.  And the client sometimes served the server...

<p> As much as the client software can help you send mail and download
interesting information from the server, it is just another program
that has control over your computer and its resources.  There are the
usual urban legends about client software from major online services
that rearranged the PC's file system - and some of this naturally
happens when you download and install a software upgrade.  What is
less amusing is the report of a Registration Wizard within beta
versions of Microsoft's Windows 95 system.  This program gathers
information about all the software that is being run on all the PC's
in your network and then reports it to Microsoft when the you signs up
for Microsoft Network Services.

<p> Performance monitoring has been around for many companies,
particularly in service organizations, e.g., the speed of the cashiers
at busy supermarkets, or of directory assistance operators.  As we
depend more and more on personal computers and get increasingly
interconnected, the potential for information gathering and reporting
to outsiders rises.  The early adopters are likely those online
services who provide the communication link, since they can directly
upload the information gathered.  But what prevents another program
from sending information via e-mail to its originators if the
communication is possible?  Visionaries speak of the much heralded
"intelligent agent" technologies from the likes of General Magic.
These would wander the net searching for information, purchasing
hardware and software, making friends and influencing other agents.
Given the above discussion, the possibilities for mischief - if
unchecked - is mind-boggling.
