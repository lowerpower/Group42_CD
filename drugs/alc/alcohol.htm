<b>What are the effects of alcohol?</b><p>

Alcohol first affects the most complex area (the frontal lobe) of the brain.
This area controls higher functions of the brain such as judgment and social
inhibitions (survival skills for group functioning).  These complex functions
are more sensitive to alcohol than the brain stem functions of respiration or
heart rate.  Therefore judgment and self control are the first abilities to be
suppressed by alcohol.  The following chart illustrates the effects of varying
blood alcohol level (BAL).

<b>EFFECTS
OF SHORT-TERM ALCOHOL ABUSE</b> <p>
<p>
Specific body functions and body parts can be influenced directly or indirectly
by alcohol.  Short-term effects include:<p>
<p>
<b>Sensation and Perception</b><p>

*	decreases in both visual and hearing acuity<p>
*	altered sensitivity to odors and taste<p>
*	reduced sensitivity to pain<p>
*	altered sense of time:  time appears to pass more rapidly<p>
*	underestimation of speed of moving objects<p>
<p>
<b>Emotions</b><p>

*	decreased fear/anxiety<p>
*	increased risk-taking behaviors<p>
*	increased likelihood of aggressive humor<p>
*	reduced inhibitions<p>
<p>
<b>Sleep</b><p>

<b></b>*	sleep disturbance and tiredness upon awakening<p>
<p>
<b>Body Organs</b><p>

*	increased urinary output due to the diuretic effect of alcohol on the
pituitary hormones<p>
*	temporary increase in heart rate and blood pressure; with higher dosages,
decreased heart rate<p>
*	dilated peripheral blood vessels in arms and legs.  This blood vessel
expansion leads to loss of body heat, while producing a feeling of added
warmth.  Hyperthermia can occur in cool water as well as cold air.<p>
*	constricted arteries supplying the heart, decreasing the supply of oxygen to
the cells which may contribute to arrhythmia<p>
<p>
<b>Motor Skills</b><p>

*	impaired performance, although individual susceptibility varies at Blood
Alcohol Level (BAL) of 0.10% or below<p>
*	decreased balance<p>
*	interference with coordination, as in tracing a moving object<p>
*	slowed reaction time<p>
<p>
<b>Hangover</b><p>

*	temporary, acute physical and psychological distress following excessive
consumption.  Nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, and anxiety are
reminders of disrupted body functions that could not be felt while intoxicated.
A hangover is the body's reaction to excessive drinking.<p>
<p>
<b>Sexuality</b><p>

*	small doses may facilitate sexual activity by overcoming excessive
inhibitions.  But while alcohol may provoke desire, even moderate amounts spoil
the capacity to perform and respond.<p>
*	decreased levels of testosterone have been measured in young males after as
few as 4-12 ounce beers<p>

<b>Synergism</b><p>

Perhaps the most dangerous alcohol/drug interaction is related to synergism, in
which the combined effect of two drugs taken together is greater than the sum
of the effects of the two drugs alone.  Mix alcohol, a CNS depressant, with
another CNS depressant, and the pharmacologic effect on the body is multiplied
or exaggerated.  Sometimes the result is drowsiness and difficulty in walking,
talking, driving, and thinking.  Breathing and heart rate can be depressed to
dangerous levels.  Some combinations of alcohol with barbiturates,
tranquilizers, and prescription painkillers can be fatal.<p>
<p>
<b>EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM ALCOHOL ABUSE</b><p>
<p>
Prolonged, heavy consumption of alcoholic beverages can result in one or more
serious, often life-threatening consequences.<p>
<p>
*	infectious diseases	*	cancer<p>
*	liver disorders and diseases	*	muscle disease<p>
*	nutritional deficiency	*	hypoglycemia<p>
*	nervous system diseases	*	mental disorders<p>
*	endocrine system disorders	*	cardiovascular diseases<p>
*	gastrointestinal system disorders 	*	alcohol/drug interactions<p>
	and diseases<p>
*	deprivation of rapid eye movements (REM) or dreaming sleep, results in
anxiety, chronic tiredness, and impaired concentration<p>
*	alcohol  use may aggravate migraine sufferers' tendency to vascular
headaches<p>

<b>What are blackouts?</b><p>

Blackouts are lapses in memory during intoxication; they are not a loss of
consciousness.  Whether lasting a few minutes or hours, blackouts are
unpredictable but usually happen when the blood alcohol level is high.  A
blackout usually occurs after ingestion of large amounts of alcohol and for
most social drinkers, it is a learning experience.  Continued drinking patterns
that produce blackouts indicate a high risk for alcohol problems. <p>
