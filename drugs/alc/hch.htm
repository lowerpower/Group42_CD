<h2>Ethanol Concentration Processes</h2>
<p>

<p>
This document describes the process required for the production of
beverage ethanol using reflux distillation.  This document is provided
for informational purposes only.
<p>
<H2><A NAME = "A1.1"> Introduction  </A> </H2>
<p>
The manufacture of concentrated beverage alcohol is a straightforward
process that can easily be done with a minimal amount of equipment.
Manufacture of beverage alcohol is currently illegal in Canada.  
Kids, don't try this at home.
<H2> <A NAME = "A1.2"> Fermentation </A> </H2>
<p>
Fermentation is a process that involves microscopic fungii called 
yeast.   These microorganisms convert certain sugars into alcohol
and carbon dioxide in the absence of oxygen.   
<p>
There are several factors that are required for healthy fermentation.
<UL>
<li><strong>Sugar.</strong> Sugar is the basic food that yeast needs to survive.
Yeast eats the sugar and converts it to alcohol and carbon dioxide. 
There are several kinds of sugar that are usable by yeast.  Yeast can
easily digest glucose and fructose (simple sugars) as well as maltose
and sucrose (a 12 carbon sugar).  Larger molecules such as dextrins
and starch are not usable by yeast.
<li><strong>Oxygen.</strong>  In order to get a good start, yeast requires oxygen
for initial growth.  If it doesn't have enough oxygen initially, it 
will take a long time for the brew to ferment.
<li><strong>Nutrients.</strong>  Yeast requires certain nutrients such as 
soluble nitrogen, B vitamins, and minerals.  If you are using straight malt
you won't need to add additional nutrients.  If you are adding a LOT of
sugar, you may require additional nutrients.
<li><strong>Cleanliness.</strong>  It is important that everything be kept very
clean, since other microorganisms can convert alcohol into acetic acid. 
The result is much lower yield from a batch, as well as strange flavors.
<li><strong>Time.</strong>  A ferment that has a very high specific gravity will
require additional time to ferment out, since the alcohol causes the
ferment to go much more slowly.
</ul>
<h2> <a NAME = "A1.3"> Typical process </a> </h2>
<p>
This document will describe a 16 litre starting batch.  You can start with
much greater sized batches, but for experimental purposes this is about the
correct size.  You will require the following tools for the ferment
process:
<ul>
<li><strong> Large pot.</strong>  This pot is not required to hold the entire 16
litres of fluid, 8 litres or so should be fine.  A larger pot gives you
more leeway, as the tendency of sugar solutions to boil over is very great.
This item can be obtained at a home brewing store or Canadian Tire.
<li><strong> Stir spoon.</strong>  This should be a heat resistant plastic spoon that
is long enough to rest in the pot  without the handle dipping into the
solution.
<li><strong>Hydrometer and measuring cup</strong>
These tools will be required to take specific gravity measurements.
<li><strong>Thermometer.</strong>  Good for telling when the solution is close to boiling.
A lab type thermometer, or a dairy thermometer is good for this purpose.
<li><strong>16 litre plastic food  bucket.</strong>  This is the container that will hold
the fermenting solution.  Places such as Dairy Queen will often sell these
items.
<li><strong>Lid with airlock or plastic sheet.</strong>  If you have a tight fitting
lid for your plastic  bucket you will need to fit an airlock to it.  If you
don't have a lid, a plastic sheet that can cover the fermenting solution
will do - make sure that you have an elastic device that you can fasten the
sheet to the bucket with.  The airlocks can be obtained at any homebrew
store such as Prairie Brewers.
<li><strong>Oven Mitts.</strong> Very important - you may want to take the pot off
the stove in a hurry.
<li><strong>100 Watt fish tank heater.</strong>  If you are impatient, you can keep
the wash warm with this heater.  More on this later. Any pet store should
sell these.
<li><strong>Stove.</strong>  It takes a fair amount of time to boil large quantities
of liquid, so you are better off having a hot stove.
<li><strong>Bleach.</strong> This is required for cleaning anything that will come in
touch with the wash after it has cooled.
</ul>
You will also need materials to make the wash.   This is a recommended list
of materials for the wash.
<ul>
<li><strong> 4 kg sugar.</strong>  This is about the right amount for a batch this
size. 
<li><strong>1 kg malt extract.</strong>  This provides nutrients for the yeast to
grow properly.  This should help the flavor somewhat too.
<li><strong>Yeast nutrient.</strong>  Since this wash uses a great deal of sugar,
addititional nutrient is required.  The vitamin enriched nutrients work the
best - a teaspoon of this is all that is required.
<li><strong>Water.</strong>  Regular city water works fine in Calgary.  Only use
water you can drink for this process unless you want to boil up the whole
batch.
<li><strong>Yeast.</strong>  Since you want to obtain as high a concentration of
ethanol in the wash as possible, the yeast that you use should be carefully
selected.  A yeast that gives satisfactory results is <strong> Lalvin EC-1118.
</strong>
</ul>
<h2><a name="A1.4">Fermentation Process Instructions</a></h2>
<p>
This is the process required to start the fermentation process.
<ol>
<li><strong>Ensure that fermentation vessel is clean.</strong>   To do this, use a
cup of bleach to 10 litres of water in your fermentation vessel.  Clean
the bucket and lid, then rinse the solution  off all items.  Make sure
there is no residual bleach, as yeast don't like bleach either.  Cover
bucket so that airborne bacteria can't get in.
<li><strong>Boil water.</strong> Place about 5 litres of water in the pot, and heat
the water until it boils.  There should be at least 10 cm of water depth in
the bottom of the pot, and the water line should be at least 10 cm from the
top of the pot.  
Heat the malt extract so that it will
pour more easily.  The best way to do this is to fill the sink with hot
water, and immerse the container of malt extract.  
<li><strong>Add sugar.</strong> Dump 4 kg of sugar into the pot. <strong> IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT TO WATCH THE POT AT THIS TIME!</strong>  Sugar solutions have a nasty
habit of boiling over - if it starts to boil over, take the solution off
the stove immediately.  Stir the solution constantly - stirring seems
to reduce the  tendency to boil over considerably.
<li><strong>Add malt extract.</strong>  Watch the pot even more carefully after this
is added.
<li><strong>Bring to a boil.</strong>  The solution should be boiled for 15 minutes
to kill residual bacteria in the malt.  This can't kill some types of
harmful bacteria, but these bacteria don't  do well in the acid solution
that is generated by this process.
<li><strong>Pour the solution into the fermenter.<li></strong>  The solution is very hot
and sticky, so be careful.
<li><strong>Add cold water.</strong> Fill the container until the liquid is about two
inches from the top.
<li><strong>Add nutrient.</strong>  Add 1 teaspoon of yeast nutrient and stir in.
<li><strong>Allow to cool.</strong>  Yeast can't take the heat, so allow the solution
to cool to about 35 C before adding the yeast.  Make sure that the
solution is covered during the cooling process to prevent other organisms
from getting into the solution.
<li><strong>Measure the specific gravity.</strong>  The value should be somewhere around
1.120 - higher or lower is OK.  Record this number for later use.
<li><strong>Pitch the yeast.</strong>  Add the yeast to the solution after it has cooled
sufficiently.  Follow the instructions on the yeast package.
<li><strong>Rouse the yeast.</strong> Stir the solution vigourously so that there is 
some dissolved oxygen in the solution.  Yeast needs some initial oxygen in
order to get a good start.  After stirring, cover the solution and. . .
<li><strong>Wait.</strong>  The fermentation process usually takes a couple of weeks to
complete - Take measurements every couple of days or so after the first week.
When the gravity stops dropping, the fermentation is complete.
</ol>
<h2><a name="A1.5"> Other Factors </a></h2>
<p>
There are several other factors to be aware of when fermenting sugar.  The
process is affected by temperature - if you are impatient, you can use an
aquarium heater to keep the temperature around 30 degrees.  Bear in mind
that there is an increased chance of other microorganisms getting a start
in your fermenting liquid if you warm it up this much, but it will go
faster.   It is important that you have some escape for the large amount of
carbon dioxide that this process generates.  If you put the ferment in a
sealed container, the container will explode leaving you with a large, foul
smelling and sticky mess.  This is why the airlock method is best.
<p>
You want to get as high a percentage of alcohol in your wash as you can. 
If you don't have a high percentage of alcohol, yield will be quite low - 
our experience is that about 3 percent (depending on how hard you push
the still) will be lost.  The extra time waiting for the solution to
ferment is worth it.  This particular variety of yeast won't ferment
solutions higher than about 18 percent alcohol though.  Best potential
alcohol numbers are between 15 and 18 percent (1.113 - 1135).
<p>
How do you figure out how much alcohol is in the final solution though?
This is really quite easy.   Say, for example, the initial reading was 
1.113, or 15 percent potential alcohol.  After the ferment, the reading was
1.010, or about 1.5 percent potential alcohol. (Most hydrometers have a
potential alcohol scale on them.)  The difference is 13.5, so there is
13.5 percent alcohol in the final solution.
<h1><a name="A2.1">The still </a> </h1>
The still is fairly easily built from readily available materials.  Most of
the machine is built from copper tubing used in standard plumbing systems.
The pot is a standard canning kettle, available from Canadian tire.  The
condenser is a copper version of the standard leibig condenser.  The
plumbing fittings are available at most hardware stores. 
<p>
The holes in the pot lid can be made by drilling a large hole with a drill
bit, then filing the hole out to size with a rat tail file.  A small
grinding wheel will help you to drill the hole more accurately.  You want
the holes to be as accurate as possible, since any leaks mean a loss of
efficiency in your still.  
<p>
The reflux tower is made from a 14 inch piece of 1 inch copper tubing.  A
piece of 14 or 12 gauge copper wire is soldered across the pot end so that
the marbles cannot escape into the pot.  Unless you place the wire so you
can push it through the hole in the pot lid, make sure that you solder the
pipe to the lid first.  Be careful when wrapping the small copper tubing
around the top of the reflux tower - it has a strong tendency to kink.
<p>
When making the top ``T'' assembly, make sure that you purchase your
thermometer first - try and find one with as small a shaft as possible.
Microwave cooking thermometers work quite well.
<p>
The reducing connectors used in the main condenser will have to be filed
out in order to get them to slide onto the 1/2 inch internal pipe. 
<p>
The garden hose will go onto the pipe connectors much more easily if you
heat the end of the hose with a hair dryer before attempting to attach the
hose.
<p>
It is best to use silver solder when making these connections - the alcohol
and acid mixture is quite corrosive to metal.  Using silver solder will 
prevent lead from leaching into the distillate.
<p>  
<h2> <a name="A2.2">The Process</a></h2>
<p>
Operating the still is quite easy, however there are some things that you
should be aware of.  There is a tendency for the pot to boil over, so don't
fill it up too much unless you like to clean your stove a lot.  Watch the
process closely, since it is quite easy for it to get out of control.
<strong> Make sure you have a fire extinguisher available.  Alcohol vapors
are extremely flamable/explosive so be very careful.  If you have a fire,
there is a good chance the fire extinguisher won't help much, but it might,
so get one.</strong>
<p>
Fill the pot from the fermentor, leaving about 5 cm of clearance from the
top of the liquid to the top of the pot.  This is important because the
solution has a tendency to boil over, and a boil over is a disgusting,
messy foul smelling event if there ever was one.  Start the heating 
process on a high setting.  When the temperature in the bottom container
reaches 70 C, turn the heat down. 
<p>
Flow through the condenser should be fairly high, however flow through the
reflux tower should be very little during the initial phase - a slow drip
should be sufficient to achieve the cooling required.   
The temperature in the reflux column should begin to rise once the pot
temperature reaches 75 C - the column will get hot at the bottom, then
the hot spot will move up towards the top of the column.
You should start to get output once the temperature in the reflux tower 
reaches 74 C. 
<p>
Throw away the first half ounce of liquid that you get from the condenser
since it will contain any light ends (such as methanol) that are contained
in the ferment.
<p>
Adjust the heat so that you get a steady drip from the end of the
condenser.  The temperature in the lower pot will start to rise slowly.
As the temperature rises, you will find that you will have to increase
the rate of flow through the reflux column.  Continue to run the still
until the temperature in the pot reaches 90 degrees.  The temperature
in the reflux column will show a sharp tendency to rise once most of
the alcohol in the solution has been boiled off.
<p>
The reasoning behind keeping the temperature at the top of the still
relatively cool is related to azeotropic temperature of the water 
alcohol mixture.  Higher water concentrations drip back down into
the still, leaving the more concentrated alcohol solutions near the
top.  This process greatly improves the efficiency of the process.
<p>
The concentration of alcohol produced by this method should be about 
75 to 80 percent alcohol by volume.  Purity is affected by the rate that
you run the still at - higher throughput rates tend to make the product
less pure.
<p>
<h2><a name="A2.3">Improvments on taste. </a></h2>
<p>
The flavor of the alcohol generated by this process is generally quite
harsh - this is caused by various impurities that followed the alcohol
through the distillation process.  There are several things that can be
done to improve this however.
<p>
One method of improving the taste is to filter the condensate through 
activated charcoal.  The carbon picks up much of the bad taste, leaving
a much better product.  The advantage of this is that you only have to
distill once.
<p>
A process that produces a much better tasting product multiple distillation.
Later distillations are done with activated carbon in the reflux column.  
The second distillation combined with the carbon in the distillation tower
picks up a great deal more of the bad tastes.  This is a vast improvement
on the straight filtration method.  There are problems with doing this 
however - some alcohol is inevitably lost through a second distillation, 
reducing efficiency.
<p>
Second distillations should be done using a much smaller pot.  If you 
decide to do this, a pressure cooker works quite well as a vessel.  Much
better results are gained if attention is spent on cleanliness.
<h2><a name="A2.4">Yields</a></h2>
<p>
From a 16 litre starting batch you will get about 1.5 litres of 80 
percent hooch - possibly a bit more, depending on the efficiency that
you distill out to.  Two litres is a reasonable goal if you are careful.
<h2><a name="A2.5">Summary</a></h2>
<p>
Making bevarage alcohol is a straightforward process, however a certain
amount of care is required for good results.  
<h2><a name="A2.6">Other Notes</A></H2>
<p>
<ol>
<li> The usual response to first tastings of hooch are a sort of squinching
up of the eyes, and the comment &quot This is Really, really bad tasting &quot 
. Orange juice can somewhat help the taste, but tomato juice is truly revolting.
<li> Aging (even a couple of weeks) helps the taste a lot.
<li> This whole thing isn't worth the effort in small quantities.  
</ol>
