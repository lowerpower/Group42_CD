First open a Homebrew and pour it in a glass.....

Stuff needed to continue:
1 20 Qt. stock pot
Water
1 7.6 Gallon Food-Grade plastic bucket with tight fitting lid and airlock
Heat (preferably a stovetop)
1 long charasamatic wooden spoon
A cool place to put your beer while it's fermenting
2 cases of empty RETURNABLE pints(16oz.)
Lot-O-bottle caps and a capper
1 Hydrometer
1 Thermometer
A complete dislike of commercial piss-water beer!

Now on to the recipe........
1st step,  Drink the Homebrew you just poured!
2nd step,
Bring 1.5 Gallons of cold H2O to boil and add:
6 Lbs. of Muntons and Fisons Amber Dry Malt
Stir it so it dosen't stick to the bottem
Add 1oz. of either Northern Brewers Hops(pellets) or 1 oz. of Galena 
Hops(pellets)
Bring it back to boil and keep it boiling for 45 min.
Boiling not simmering
5 min. before the time is up add 1/2 oz. Fuggles Hops(pellets)
Pour this boiling concoction into your STERILIZED fermenter along with enough 
H2O to make 5 Gallons.
Put the Thermometer and the Hydrometer in the bucket too!
When the temp. is around 70DEGF add either 7 grams Red Star Ale yeast or 14 
grams Whitbread Ale yeast.
Pitch the yeast by sprinkling it on top, letting it sit for 5 min. then 
stirring it in
Put the lid on with the airlock and leave it alone for 7 days
Again use the Hydrometer to check the Specific Gravity on the 7th day and 
again on the 8th day......If the reading are the same   Bottle it!

To Bottle:

Drink another Homebrew then:
STERILIZE your bottles then siphon the beer in to another bucket or your stock
pot add 3/4 CUP corn sugar(Make a simple syrup with 2cups H2O and the 3/4cup
corn sugar) syphon into your bottles.  Cap them!

OK,so your newbrew is in the bottle and now you ask the all-important 
question..................When the HELL can I drink it?????????

Wait about 2 weeks.
The longer you leave it in the bottle the better it will become!
My stoudt, was 10 months old when I opened it and it was World-Class!!!
