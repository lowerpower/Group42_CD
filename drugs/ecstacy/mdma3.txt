This is something that a friend of mine picked up at the last rave party in San
Francisco - so, if there's anyone out there who is interested in doing "E"
for the first time, read this for a little more information...

Don't mind the part about the law controling minors....

Anyway, check this out--this is a small flier that was posted and
all around the space (100,000 sqft)

*ALL MINORS TO EXIT AT 2:30am*

     "e info - practical information about ecstacy"

The multi-faceted jewel

Ectasy catalyzes a powerful experience that takes many
different forms.  It can provoke and intense, energetic,
spiritual high or lead to warm, loving relaxation.  It can
connect poeple freely and openly with each other or promote
deep inner thinking and analysis.  Sensual yet not neccessarily
sexual, beautiful and sometimes dangerous, Ecstacy covers a
wide range of human emotions, experiences, and passions.
What you put into it is what you get out, so be sure to explore
the many facets of the experience.

Those little annoying side effects

Although some people say it has no side effects, Ecstasy is
not the perfect drug.  Users have reported a variety of mild
physical symptoms such as jaw clencing, teeth grinding, eye
wiggles, tightened muscles, sweating, chills, increased heart
rate, blood pressure and body temperature, auditory effects,
nausea, shaking, and next-day sleepiness.  Occasionally it can
cause toxic reactions in people with asthma, heart conditions,
diabetes, epilepsy, psychosis, or depression.  Remember, Ecstasy is
a powerful drug.  Treat it - and your body - with respect.

As time passes...

Myths abound concerning Ecstasy's effects after repeated usage.
Most claims (such as that it causes Parkinson's disease or drains
spinal fluid) actually refer to other drugs or common misconceptions.
Although scientists suspect that some nerve terminal damge and
neurotransmitter depletion in the brain based on animal research, the
true long term effects and implications remain a mystery until
further human research becomes legal.  By avoiding the temptation
to use Ecstasy too frequently, you can lessen the risk and have
more fun.

Less is more

An active does of Ecstasy depends on one's body weight, sensitivity,
and prior use.  A typical "hit" contains 75-125 milligrams.  Over 175
milligrams increases side effects for many users.  Taking a larger dose
does not neccessarily mean a better experience - it may be more
"speedy," but less ecstatic.

Some tips for Ecstasy users

*  Drink water to replenish body fluids.

*  From time to time, stop dancing and chill for a while.  Take deep
     breaths and relax.

*  Maintain a healthy lifestyle outside the raves:  eat a balanced diet,
   take vitamins, and get plenty of sleep.

*  Remember:  Less is more.  Large or frequent doses can increase
    the side effects without adding to the experience.

*  Integrate what you've learned.  Think about your thoughts and
          feelings and try to apply them to real life.

*  Much of what is sold as Ecstasy is not pure MDMA.  Be cautious of what
    you buy and who you buy it from.  Impurities may include
    amphetamine, LSD, heroin, or PCP.

*  Alcohol can reduce or change the effects of Ecstasy, and the
    combination can cause undesired effects.
