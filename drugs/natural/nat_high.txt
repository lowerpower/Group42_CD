>Hieracium Pilocella (Haret Hogeurt) - similar to cannabis

   I happen to live in a country where this occurs naturally. I once picked
up some leaves, dried them and tried to smoke them. The smoke was so
diabolic that I nearly choked to death. Perhaps I should've tried an
extraction.

>Peganum Harmala (passionflower) - very mild marijuana-like high

   Wrong. Passionflower is _Passiflora incarnata_. Peganum harmala is Syrian
rue. The seeds are generally not smoked, though they are sometimes burned
as an incense in the Middle East. It has very little in common with marijuana
and is definitely not mild in hallucinogenic doses. The alkaloids in the seeds
are MAOIs, so be careful.
   After chewing ten grams of the seeds, I spent several hours lying on my
bed and wondering whether stroke or cerebral hemorrhage comes first. I had
not eaten anything nor drunk coffee that day. The trip was interesting, but
the physical side effects were horrible.
