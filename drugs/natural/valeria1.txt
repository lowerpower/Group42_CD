        Some months ago I bought 30 x 150mg tablets of valerian root.
        (we can buy it in Finland without prescription or anything
        for a cost of about 20mk (4$)). First I tried it with small
        amouts like 150-300mg. Well, got bored because of too slight
        efects. I also tried crushing the tablets for better/faster
        efects - nothing. Finally, with a 900mg dosage I felt myself
        really tired. Afterall it is a tranquillizer, with pretty
        shit effects... Blaah.. How can someone feel relaxed after
        taking such shit, I wonder.. ?!

Don't ever give any of this stuff to a cat.  A few years ago a 
friend of mine had some valerian and his cat got into it.  At 
first she reacted to it like catnip, so he would occasionally
give her some.  Then she started trying to pull her own head
off, whether she was on the valerian or not.

BTW: We smoked the root, and got mildly interesting effects.

For those who do not believe in the strength of herbs, I purchased some 
Valerian/Passionflower and would like to offer my personal observations. 

WOW!  I came home from finals and was exhausted/awake (common for me), so  
decided to give 2ml of the extract a whirl.  I went into a deep sleep for
3 hours and woke up refreshed and mellow.
