Opioid Addiction and Withdrawal

**********        

        The FAQ will use morphine as the standard opioid and base all other 
opioids in relation to it. (Kinda like class inheritance in C++).

**********

A little glossary to start the FAQ:

opiate  - narcotic analgesic derived from a natural source(opium poppy)
opioid  - narcotic analgesic that is either semi or fully synthetic
        - also refers to entire family of both opiates and opioids
IM      - intramuscular injection
SC      - subcutaneous injection

                           **  Morphine  **

Synopsis        
        Morphine is naturally occurring substance in the opium poppy, 
        Papaver somniferum.  It is a potent narcotic analgesic, and its 
        primary clinical use is in the management of moderately severe 
        and severe pain.  After heroin, morphine has the greatest 
        dependence liability of the narcotic analgesics in common use.  
        Morphine is administered by several routes (injected, smoked, 
        sniffed, or swallowed); but when injected particularly 
        intravenously, morphine can produce intense euphoria and a general 
        state of well-being and relaxation.  Regular use can result in 
        the rapid development of tolerance to these effects.  Profound 
        physical and psychological dependence can also rapidly develop, 
        and withdrawal sickness upon abrupt cessation of heroin use; many 
        of the symptoms resemble those produced by a case of moderately 
        severe flu.

        Morphine is infrequently encountered in the North American street 
        drug culture.  However, mainly because of its availability in 
        hospitals, there have been several documented cases of morphine 
        dependence among health professionals.

Drug Source
        Morphine is isolated from crude opium, which is a resinous 
        prep of the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum.

Trade Name
        Roxinal, MS Contin, Morphine Sulfate

Street Names
        "M", morph, Miss Emma

Drug Combinations
        Use of morphine plus cocaine, as well as of morphine plus 
        methamphetamine, has been reported.  However, such combinations 
        are not frequently encountered.

Medical Uses
        * symptomatic relief of moderately severe to severe pain;         
        * relief of certain types of difficult or labored breathing;
        * suppression of severe cough (rarely); 
        * suppression of severe diarrhea (e.g., that produced by cholera).    
   

Physical Appearance
        Morphine is legally available only in the form of its water-soluble 
        salts.  Most common are morphine sulfate and morphine hydrochloride.  
        Both are fine white crystalline powders, bitter to the taste.  Both 
        are soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol.

Dosage
~~~~~~
Medical
        For moderate to severe pain the optimal intramuscular dosage is 
        considered to be 10 mg per 70 kg body weight every four hours.  
        The typical dose range is from 5 to 20 mg every four hours, 
        depending on the severity of the pain.  The oral dose range is 
        between 8 and 20 mg; but with oral administration morphine has 
        substantially less analgesic potency (approximately one-tenth of 
        the effect produced by subcutaneous injection) because it is 
        rapidly destroyed as it passes through the liver immediately 
        after absorption.  The intravenous route is employed primarily 
        for severe post-operative pain or in an emergency; in this case 
        the dose range is between 4 and 10 mg, and the analgesic effect 
        ensues almost immediately.

Nonmedical
        Irregular or intermittent users (who are not substituting the drug 
        for another narcotic analgesic) may start and continue to use doses 
        within the therapeutic range (e.i., up to 20 mg).  However, regular 
        users who employ morphine for its subjectively pleasurable effects 
        frequently increase the dose as tolerance develops.  To take several 
        hundred milligrams per day is common, and there are reliable reports 
        of up to four or five grams (4000 - 5000 mg) per day.


Routes Of Administration
        Morphine may be taken orally in tablet form, and can also injected 
        subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; the last is the 
        route preferred by those who are dependent on morphine.       

Short Term Use 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Low Doses (single doses of 5 - 10 mg administered by S.C or IM injection in 
non-tolerant users)

CNS, behavioral, subjective: 
        suppression the sensation of and emotional response to pain; 
        euphoria; drowsiness, lethargy, relaxation; difficulty in 
        concentrating; decreased physical activity in some users and 
        increased physical activity in others; mild anxiety or fear; 
        pupillary constriction, blurred vision, impaired night vision, 
        suppression of cough reflex.

Respiratory: 
        slightly reduced respiratory rate. 

Gastrointestinal: 
        nausea and vomiting; constipation; loss of appetite; decreased 
        gastric motility. 
        
Other: 
        slight drop in body temperature; sweating; reduced libido; prickly 
        or tingling sensation on the skin (particularly after intravenous 
        injection).

Duration
        4 - 5 hours

Dependency Potential
        high, continued use results in both psychological and physical 
        dependency

                            **  Codeine  **

Drug Source
        Codeine is found in opium in concentrations between %0.1 and %2. 
        Because of the small concentration found in nature, most codeine 
        found in medical products is synthesized from morphine via the 
        methylation of the hydroxyl group found on the second non-aromatic 
        ring.

Trade Name
        There are no commercial name for products containing only 
        codeine in US. Found under common name of codeine.  
        Canada does have a codeine only syrup available under 
        Paveral. Mainly found in combination products.

Street Name
        T-three's (Tylenol #3 w/ codeine), schoolboy, cough syrup
        
Medical Uses
        * relief of mild to moderate pain
        * relief of non-productive cough
        * relief of diarrhea

Drug Combinations
        Sold under many name brand products, the most popular being the
        Tylenol with Codeine series, the number on the tablet corresponds 
        to the amount of codeine and caffeine found in the each tablet.

        Tylenol #1 w/ codeine -  8 mg codeine, 15 mg caffeine
        Tylenol #2 w/ codeine - 15 mg codeine, 15 mg caffeine
        Tylenol #3 w/ codeine - 30 mg codeine, 30 mg caffeine
        Tylenol #4 w/ codeine - 60 mg codeine, no caffeine
        
        note: all tablets contain same amount of acetaminophen (300 mg)
        
        Fiorinal (aspirin, caffeine, barbital, codeine)

        Many other brand name product combinations.

Physical Appearance
        Tylenol w/ codeine series are imprinted with number on one side and
        other side is Tylenol label(McNeil).

Controlled Substance Status
        As a single product codeine is a schedule II controlled substance
        in the US.
        When combined with other non-controlled substance, and depending
        on amount per dose unit, codeine combined products range from 
        schedule III to V. 
        Canada has OTC codeine products available if product has no more
        than 8 mg of codeine per unit dose. Some US areas may have codeine
        preps available OTC, but usually require release form.
        As an interesting fact, a travelers handbook noted that Greece has
        banned codeine in that country (no idea on what it's status is now)
        so be careful when traveling there.

Dosage
~~~~~~
Medical
        Pain relief : 30mg - 220mg oral or equivalent dose SC or IM 
        
        Diarrhea relief : 10mg - 20mg orally
        
        Cough suppressant : 5mg - 15mg orally

Nonmedical
        Doses can range from 30mg up to 400mg. LD50 for codeine is 800mg in
        a average nontolerant person.
        At doses of > 250mg adverse effects tend to arise, including intense
        itching, flushed skin, dizziness, sedation, nausea and vomiting

Short Term Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CNS, Behavioral, Subjective:
        Hydrocodone has effects similar to morphine, except euphoria is
        similar to codeine, nausea and vomiting is quite rare, and 
        sedation is practically non-existent

Respiratory:
        Hydrocodone depresses respiration minimally.

Gastrointestinal:
        Hydromorphone effects GI tract very little.

Other:
        Although hydromorphone's euphoria pales with other opioids
        it's abuse potential comes from the fact the rush experienced
        from IV use is very similar to heroin's.

        Hydromorphone is one of the most used opioids in the relief of
        pain for the terminally ill.  The reasons being it's minimal
        side effects, and high potency.

                        Opioid Dependence And Withdrawal

        Opioids have specific withdrawal and dependence characteristics 
common to all opioids, varying according to the specific drug.  All opioids
cause both physical and psychological dependence with prolonged use.  

        Depending on the opioid in question withdrawal can become evident
after continued use in as little time as 2 weeks or as long as 2 months.

        Withdrawal is commonly overstated by media and tends to be similar
to bad case of flu.  This is due to the fact that most opioid users don't
tend to be able to acquire enough drug to result in severe withdrawal.  It
must be noted that physical symptoms may be similar to flu, psychological
symptoms can be quite painful.  Depression, mood swings, hypersensitivity
to pain are some common symptoms.  Opioid withdrawal DOES NOT endanger life
as does alcohol and other depressant withdrawal.
