I divorce myself from all the biases and inacuracies and inflammatory
comments which may catch the *spark* in your eye. All flames will be

	OPIUM IN CHINA (1700-1860)

CHRONOLOGY:

source: (Research Issues 24) Perspectives on the History of Psychoactive
	Substance Use; NIDA,USDHEW 1978. pgs 134-140 (i doubt I'll do that muc

c. 1700	Introduction	Use of tobacco-opium mixtures (madak) begins in the
East Indies (probably Java) spreads to Formosa, Fukien and the South China
coast (refs).  In 1689, Engelberg Kaempfer inspects primitive dens where the
mixture is dispensed (Amoenitates Exoticae, 1712:642-5).

1729	First Edict	Reports reach Peking of the evils of opium smoking
			(shrivelling up the features; early deaths) in
			Formosa and Fukien; Emperor Yung Chen prohibits
			the sale of opium and the operation of smoking 
			houses. etc. etc. blah blah blah.....

c. 1750	The British East India Company assumes control of Bengal
	and Bihar, the opium growing districts of eastern India;
	British shipping dominates the Bengal opium trade out of 
	Calcutta.

1757	Early Trade	Britain annexes Bengal; the Chinese confine 
			foreing trade to Canton where it can be restricted
			and controlled in the interests of revenue for
			the Chinese.  Honk Kong merchants serve as 
			intermediaries between the foreigners and the 
			Chinese authorities.

1767 Opium Imports Rise	Opium from Bengal continues to enter China despite
			the edict of 1729 prohibiting smoking.  It 
			increases in frequency from 200 chests annually
			in 1729 to 1000 annually by 1967.  However, much is 
			for medicinal use.  Tariffs are collected on the
			opium.

1772 The East India company establishes a limited monopoly over Bengal 
	opium; the company has general control but the operation is
	in the hands of contractors, who advance company funds to the
	farmers, purchase the opium produced, and sell it to the company
	which then auctions it off to merchants in Calcutta.
	British companies are the principal shippers.

1773-86	Limited Monopoly	Warren Hastings, the first governor general of
				India, recognizes that opium is harmful and at
				first opposes increasing production; later
				he encoiurages the the control of opium by the
				company hoping that by monopolizing and 
				limiting the supply he will discourage its
				consumption.  This limited monopoly lasts
				throughout his administration and beyond,
				but when the Chinese market is discovered,
				the monopoly shifts from controlling to
				expanding cultivation.

1779	Opium Imported	First mention of actual trading in opium at Canton.

1780	Prohibition Attempted	British traders establish an opium depot at 
				Macao.  ANother imperial edict prohibits 
				consumption of opium and reiterates
				prohibition of its sale.

1787	British		Trade in opium is still less important than trade
	debate		in commodities; directors of the East India Company,
	over opium.	recognizing China's objections to the importation of 
			opium, make offers to prohibit the export of Indian
			opium to China.  However, company representatives
			in Canton declare that the Chinese are never sincere
			in their declared intentions of suppressing illicit 
			traffic, as long as the officials issue prohibitory
			edicts with one hand and extend the other to receive
			bribes from the illegal trade.

1796	Prohibition	Alarmed by increasing use, the emperor issues an
	Attempted	edict forbiding importation of opium, as well as
			export of Chinese silver that is being used as a
medium of exchange.  Now even legitimate trade is limited to barter.
Nonetheless, illegal purchase of opium with silver continues.

1797	Trade Monopoly	The company assumes full control of Bengal opium.

1799	Trade,			A strong edict by authorities at Canton,
	cultivation ban.	supporting the emperor's decree of 1796,
				forbids opium trade at that port.  A 
concurrent drive against native poppy growing is initiated.  Opium becomes
an illicit commodity.

	Trade diverted,		The 1799 edict increases traffic through
	smuggling.		Macao and other areas beyond government
			control enabling UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH.  The British
declare only their legitimate cargo, leave opium on board to be picked up
by Chinese mercahnts who smuggle it ashore in small, fast ( :) boats.

1800	Anti-Opium		Opium becomes identified with official
	policy develops.	corruption, criminals and antigovernment
				secret societies.  An imperial edict
prohibits domestic cultivation and repeats the prohibition against
importing opium.  China develops an anti-opium policy, at least on paper.
Edicts continue to be issued reiterating prohibitions against importation,
sale, and consumption of opium.

1804 Canton Trade Resumes	Opium trading resumes at the port of Canton.
				Though the 1799 edict is still in force,
it has little effect and no immediate practical change in policy ensues.

Maybe I 'll type more later. Depends on the colour of the flames I guess.

	" Patent medicines and opium preperations such as _Dover's Powder
	were readilly available without restrictions.  Indeed,
	Laudanum (opium mixed with alcohol) was cheaper than beer or wine
	and readily within the means of the lowest-paid worker.  As a result,
	throughout the first half of the 19th century, the incidence of opium
	dependance appears to have increased steadily in Enland, Europe and the
	United States.  Working-class medicinal use of opium-bearing _nostrums_
	as sedatives for children was especially prominent in England.
	However, despite some well known cases among 19th century English
	literary amd creative personalities--Thomas de Quincey, Byron, Shelley,
	Coleridge, and Dickens--recreational use was 
	limited, and there is no evidence that use was so excessive as to be a
	medical or social concern."
