Dimenhydrinate is the 8-chlorotheophyllinate salt of diphenhydramine.
The only important difference is potency: 50mg of dimenhydrinate is
equivalent to 25mg of diphenhydramine hydrochloride.  Same drug.

It's still stupid to try to get high from overdosing on antihistamines.
It's unpleasant and potentially dangerous.

It is diphenhydramine, an antihistamine.  Sold as an allergy medication,
and a sleep aid.  It's more expensive as a sleep aid, even though it's the
same formulation- I guess they figure people will pay more to be sleepy than
they will to ease up their asthma attacks.  Or maybe it's a "sin tax" thing?
Took 250 mg once (a reckless experiment- but 60mg and 125mg on previous
nights didn't seem to do anything- and I was curious) and I didn't like it
at all.
(That's equivalent to ten 25 mg tablets.)  There's a feeling like, uh, you're
slipping away from yourself, you can't control what happens to you, etc.
All I wanted to do, for some reason, was read, read, read, but the next
day I didn't remember anything that happened on 20 pages.  (Useless.)
Hallucination has been reported but if I recall correctly, they aren't the
kind you'd want to have! (e.g. Thinking someone has been in the room who
hasn't, believing that you have to do chores that you've already done,
thinking that it's Tuesday when it's Saturday, etc.)  Not beautiful
spiral patterns on the wall or audio reverbations or anything LSD-ish, so
if you're looking for an "LSD replacement", speaking from personal
experience, I don't recommend diphenhydramine at all.

       I've posted this before with no response:  Does anyone know what
methedrine is?  I guess not.  I am assuming that it's some type of meth-
amphetamine analog.  A friend says he has access to this drug and intends to
try it soon.  I just thought I'd ask one last time for his benefit.

       On a different note, I've seen several postings regarding Jimson Weed
(Datura Stramonium I believe).  I was always curious about this plant, but
the effects described sound similar to Gravol (Dramamine), which I HAVE
tried.  I for one would class it more as a deleriant than a hallucinogen.
The trip started with a nice stoned feeling, but quickly changed.  When
staring at any white object (ceilings, and even cups or cupped hands) I
noticed a strange clear gellatin-like substance that seemed to jiggle and
spread towards me (looked a lot like the alien in the Predator movies).
While doing LSD or psilocybin, I have always been able to tell reality from
hallucinations.  This is not the case with Dramamine.  Several times I car-
ried on conversations with individuals before discovering they were non-
existant.  I saw people and objects that were not there as well.  Perhaps the
worst aspect of the trip was the auditory part.  I constantly heard my name
being called, and sound is magnified to a very uncomfortable level.  Speech
(even from myself) was not only loud and difficult, but VERY slurred.  Com-
munication was difficult due to the fact that I would forget what I was talk-
ing about in mid-sentence, and would finish most sentences off by saying "Uh,
nevermind...I forgot."  The amount of paranoia that prevailed throughout the
trip was unbearable: especially after I saw my brother rise out of a pile of
clothes in the floor to tell me that my father (who happens to be the head
of a drug task force) was calling me.  Maybe all of this was due to the fact
that I was alone for the majority of this experience (nightmare).  Definate-
ly a one time experience for me.  Not recomended for the weak of heart or
mind.  Especially at that dosage: 24 tablets!

Hi,

    After seeing the posts on Marezine, I checked out anti-emetics in
general and anti-histamines, and came across the anti-histamine
hallucinogenic tendency.  So I got some dimenhydrinate, the local
Rite-Aid variety (cheaper than Dramamine--sp?), and paid four bucks for
two boxes of twelve at 50 mg each.  I was going to take them with a
friend, but another friend wanted to split them three ways, so we had
eight apiece (400 mg).  We were pretty tired before we took them (about
one in the morning), and especially with the anti-histamine property of
putting one to sleep, we decided to have some coffee.  We, being
stoopid, put a hefty amount of Bailey's in our coffee, which I think was
one of the reasons we didn't react much.  About forty minutes passed,
and we finally started feeling it.  When inquired about my head, I said,
"I think my brain shrunk."  It felt very odd--not light, not heavy, just
empty. :)  When spoken to, we would have a delay (five to ten seconds)
before we could reply, which started amusing me, but I couldn't seem to
help it.  I went to bed about two hours later (had a fun time walking
there, too), and tried to sleep.  I thought it was wearing off.  The dry
mouth thing was buggin, so I kept some water by my bed.  I had a hard
time going to sleep, especially when a couple times I was choking and
found it difficult to bring in air through my throat (as opposed to
through my lungs).  I am a MILD asthmatic, and I was just starting to
get sick, so that probably had something to do with it, but my friend
said he started having to _think_ about breathing.  I woke up about
seven hours later alive, but with a pretty good headache.  I only talked
to one of the other friends, and he said he was still messed up that
afternoon with the delay and stuff.

    I guess I'd try it again, but with no alcohol (I doubt what we had
was a very big factor, though) and more dimenhydrinate (to try to get
the hallucinations).  If anyone has tried it under better conditions,
please post (especially whether or not you had hallucinations), and
thanks in advance.

We used to do this stuff in junior high when we couldnt get anything else,
and yes if you take 4 or more you poisen your system and hallucinate badly.
One of my friends thought his dad was his girl friend and tried to do her,
needless to say he ended up in the hospital getting his stomach pumped. And
my other friend thought a gas pump was alive and attacking his car so he ran
over it. It was all captured on video camera, he had some explaining to 
do in court. And when I did it I felt like i had aton of bricks dropped onto
my head the next day. Mushrooms or mescaline is much better!!!

OK, I saw the posts on marezine on the net, and decided to see if they
sold it at the local drug store.  Sure enough - they did - $6.09 for
a box of 12.  I took 7 of them at 10:45 PM (I wanted to be conservative
since I don't know anyone firsthand who has done this).  I went out -
after two hours, the only effect I got was feeling REALLY tired.
(Note - I'm 6 foot, 160lbs, male, with no tolerance to any drug)I
went back home around 1AM, and took 3 more for a total of 10.  I
stayed in my room for about 30 min. then went out for a walk. I
wasn't really feeling that tired anymore, and felt dazed.

As I walked down a dark, quiet, back road listening to the Dead on my
headphones - I saw a glowing white ball.  At first I thought it was
a person, then I thought it was an animal.  It was about the size of
a basketball, about 70 yards away.  It was bouncing up and down and
back and forth.  As I got closer - I realized that the halucinations
had begun.  I was actually surprised - because after almost 3 hours of
nothing - I was hallucinating.  I looked up at the stars - and saw some
really amazing psychedelic patterns twisting and gyrating among the
clounds.  It wasn't anything like acid/shrooms - everything was just a
dull white (no colors at all with eyes open) but it was still very
cool.  Also it was different because occasionally I would just see big
flashes like a strobe light.  The best thing was the way the patterns
worked their way into the clouds - I'd never seen anything quite like it -
I would see the wild geometric patters flying around - then all of a sudden
the would go INTO a cloud - and the cloud would start glowing!  And then
the cloud would burst and all the zig zags would come flying out of it
again.

After a while, I went back and layed in my bed.  I could see colorful
paterns with my eyes closed - but not when open.  The colors were only
simple red, yellow, green, and blue's, and the line patterns were
not too complex.  One cool thing that I could do was concentrate on
some object, for example a soda can - and I could see that object perfectly
clearly - and I would see my hands (this is all with eyes closed) and could
move the object around - I thought that was cool.  Then I actually heard
a woman's voice - I knew it was just in my head - but I she seemed to
have a mind of her own.  I talked to her - and she came up with these
funny respones out of no where - it made me laugh.  Eventually all of
the effects went away - but I could not fall asleep.  I did not fall
asleep till around 5 AM.

Overall, I would say its worth trying once, definitely different.  It doesn't
have that "deep thought" thing thats going on with acid/shrooms which is
kind of refreshing in a way, makes it more recreational and less spiritual.

Well, I'm a 160 pound individual and I took 9 of the tablets (the box
contains 12, If I remember correctly).  It had some hallucinogenic
properties (lights seemed brighter, shadows moved around) but 
nowhere near as good as LSD.  My thoughts were a little abnormal,
but again, it wasn't as interesting as LSD.  However, the side-effects
were quite disquieting.  My eyes became very dry it seemed, and I 
had to blink often, so even when I saw something cool, I couldn't
concentrate on it.  The drug also made me very lethargic at first, and
I wasn't sure whether I was going to pass out or not.  This tired feeling
lasted for most of the "trip", and I would wonder into semi-sleep states
where I had something resembling dreams until I understood that I
was falling asleep and snapped out of it.  This scared me as I didn't
know whether I had overdosed and this was serious, or whether it
was just a normal side-effect.  Anyway, I didn't like almost losing
consciousness.  Finally, after about 3 or 4 hours, I tried to go to sleep.
I felt tired, but could not fall asleep.  After a while, I started to have
slight muscle spasms in my right arm which occurred whenever I 
didn't move for a few moments (definately not conducive to sleeping).
By now I definately wanted the effects to go away.  What I'm saying
is that Marezine provided some interesting visuals, greater than
Marijuana, but not as beautiful or interesting as LSD/shrooms, but
the side-effects were definately not worth it.  If you think you might be
into this type of thing, you might as well bang your head against a
brick wall until you start seeing spots or somehting; that's about the
level of enjoyment I received from it.  Stick to LSD if you can, if not,
get a Robo buzz, but I for one do not recommend Marezine unless
you actually do take it for motion sickness.
