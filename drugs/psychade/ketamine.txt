My note on Ketamine raised some response from the net, and I
thought I would respond to mind-l in general, as well as to the
specific folks who were curious.  

*IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER*  I am a scientific PhD, not a physician
                        Neither I nor my employer take any
                        responsibility for its accuracy or
                        possible use.

First, ketamine is in current use as both a veternary and a
human anesthetic.  It is called "dissociative" in action, which
means that the mind is "separated" from the body.  In many
cases, this separation results in profound hallucinations and
the sensation of entering another reality.  In human use, a
benzodiazapine like Versed is generally used along with
ketamine to induce amnesia concerning the "emergence
reactions".

The most easily obtained reference about ketamine is
the Physicians Desk Reference.  Under the heading "Ketalar",
this gives a great deal of information about the drug.  Of
course, since this is a general medical reference, much of the
info of interest to mind-l is not present, but it should be
read anyway.  

Perhaps the most important property of ketamine is that,
despite the induction of both anesthesia and dissociation, the
cough and gag reflexes *USUALLY* are not affected.  This means
that, contrary to most other agents which will produce
anesthesia and/or unconsciousness, it is very unlikely that a
person using ketamine will aspirate their own saliva and other
excretions.  This is *NOT* guarenteed, but is a pretty good
bet.  Solo use, however, remains dangerous.

Ketamine is generally available for non-medical uses as
ketamine hydrochloride.  Some major chemical houses carry it at
a cost of about $10/gm.  I don't know if there are other
sources which are cheaper, or if the veterinary form is easily
available.  

Dosages are discussed in the PDR, but are generally in the
range of 100-500 mg.  Conventional useage is intravenous or
intramuscular, but "recreational" use is apparently more often
through insufflation (snorting) or solution ingestion.  These
latter approaches are probably only effective with the
hydrochloride form, but the reported doses are similar to the
conventional medical doses.  


As in all such experiments, if you must do this, be sure of
your materials and start slow, with small doses separated by
enough time to really come back to Earth between experiments.

FWIW, a friend of mine who does K regularly insists that the _only_
way to do it is intramuscularly (i.e., once you try it that way, you
will always want to do it that way).  He says an optimal dose this
way is 100 mg (ml).  It puts him in a state where he is completely
divorced from his body and is projected into some astral plane as pure
consciousness.  He says you could drag his body up and down the stairs
while he is in this state and he would have no idea that this was 
happening.  To him, doing K this way is as close as he can come to 
dying without dying, and it is always a beautiful, wondrous experience.  
He claims that taking it orally produces nowhere near as intense an 
experience, but you seem like you had a really excellent trip.  I've 
never done the stuff myself, just thought I'd pass along this second-hand 
account for anyone interested ...

        Ketamine HCl, available as 100mg/ml injectable under the trade name
        Vetalar (Parke-Davis) and Ketaset (Bristol) is used in veterinary
        work as a general anesthetic.  The dosage used produces analgesia
        but with normal pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes.  It only causes
        mild respiratory depression.  The advantage of this anesthetic is
        that you don't need to support respiration while performing any
        procedures.  This allows for a one-man operation.  It is so widely
        used in the Veterinary profession that I don't think abuse will
        cause it to be discontinued, but I can see that it will one day
        be serialized and accountable as a controlled substance (as all
        barbituates currently are).

        If you think that you will be able to go into a vets office and say
        that you are going to anesthetize your cat, forget it.  They only
        use this drug for their surgical procedures, there is no reason why
        anyone would need to buy this drug.  Think about stealing the drug
        instead, or fake that you are a vet and purchase them from a wholesale
        drug supplier.  Vet pharmaceuticals are not watched by DEA all that
        much, and the distributors are very lax.  At least they were when I
        was in the business.

                -----------------------------------------

        Ketamine is chemically 2-(2-Chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)-
cyclohexanone.  Vitamin K's are naphthoquinones.  Not the same thing!
Too much vitamin K and you will give yourself a stroke, this is not a
recreational drug!

        Ketamine is used as a human and animal anesthetic.  Vets use it for
cats or any small animal and reptiles.  I can't say what an IM (intra-
muscular) injection is like, but an IV injection is very similar to when
someone takes a crowbar and smacks you as hard as they can to the base of
your skull!  Don't be standing up when you do this, you will hit the floor
hard!  Better yet, be in an easy chair, you will immediately lose all body
control, very frightening to say the least.  Experiment with a few mg at a
time.  The insert states that the recommended dosage for anesthesia (5 to 10
minute duration) is 2mg/kg.  A 70kg adult would then use 140mg or about 1 and
a half CC's of injectable for a 10 minute duration of anesthesia.  Of course
it is the coming OFF not the going ON that is where all the wierd stuff
occurs.  Medically these are called emergence reactions, but I call them
hallucinations!  :)  If being awake and paralyzed doesn't scare you, the
hallucination is cool.  If it frightens you, or if you become frightened,
you will snowball into a very bad trip.  Mood is everything on Ketamine,
and like all recreational drugs, after you have used it a few times, you get
a feel for it and are not so apt to be frightened by it.  For those who have
smoked angel dust (PCP; HOG; Phencyclidine) the effects are about the same,
only you retain less awareness while under Ketamine.  I can definately say
that you want to take a dosage about 1/4 the recommended dose to not totally
go into anesthesia, but just dangle around the half conscious state.  A very
cool feeling!  :)  For me it is about 40mg injected IV with a tuberculin
syringe (1cc 27g 1/2).  A little more for a little deeper, but going all the
way into anesthesia is not all that special, you can't really think or remember
while under the full dose, I don't recommended it on your first try.  Always
have a health care professional available while you try this to maintain your
airway should you have a negative reaction to the drug.  As with all noxious
chemicals, you will feel like shit for several hours after the experience,
especially if you try to walk, carry on a conversation, or do any activity
that requires mental clarity.  BE CAREFUL!  Learn about anesthesia before
attempting to play with anesthetic drugs

  An excellent book on Ketamine is called "Journey's to the bright side"
 I'm failing to remember the author's name but she also wrote the "Seth 
speaks" books. Journey"s is completely about her experience's with  "K"
it seem's that her husband was an anasthesiologist and regularly dosed 
her.The story goes that she eventually started going to the same familier
place or dimension and meeting certain beings.She acually started a therapy
group called Samadhi,I believe in Seattle.The book is facinating,though it
was out of print when I found it in 1979.Unfortunatly she was murdered in 
Seattle.Her husband believe's because she was writing an expose' on a local
satanic cult,apparently they never found her head.Anyway John Lilly the 
"Dolphin guy" has some pretty amazing stories about "K" also.The same 
kind of experience"s as Journey's.
