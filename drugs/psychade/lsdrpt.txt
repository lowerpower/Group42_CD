         LSD experiences

Back in 1984 I was stationed at <some air base in US>
For the last four years I had been a good little airman and gave up
pot, LSD, mescalin, and other fun stuff of my youth and also like a good
little airman I took to the bottle with a vengeance. Working with me was a
really cool dude named <Jim>. <Jim> and I instantly connected and every
friday night we put our families on hold, bought some Wild Irish Rose and
Vivarin and played guitar and talked religion and philosophy 'til the wee
hours. Eventually talk turned to the spiritual aspect of the LSD
experience and it wasn't long before we were planning a little trip. I
figured that if we dropped on friday night we'd have plenty of time to
recover before monday rolled around, so it was set; the next friday we
would both trip one last time and see what we get out of it. Well, things
didn't quite go as planned. After my Biology class was over I headed over
to <Jim's> house full of anticipation. But when I got there, <Jim> wasn,t
alone; he had <Joe> there with him! Bad enough anyone else was involved,
<Joe> was the epitome of uptight and white. "Hey <Jim>," I said, "why is
<Joe> here?". <Jim> said "Check out his eyes!" and sure enough, <Joe's>'
pupils were dripping all over the floor. Turns out <Jim> had mentioned it
to a few people and we had some deliveries to make. "THIS IS NOT GOOD!" I
thought, but the ball was rolling... so we dropped it off to some other
guys in the shop (people who reported to me as I was the swingshift shop
chief at the time!) and headed back to <Jim's> to await the effects. About
an hour went by and I wasn't feeling anything. <Jim> and <Joe> were
zoomin' so I chilled out and let those two jam on guitars for a while
while I relaxed. Then there was a knock on the door. "I'll get it," I
said. I went to the door and looked out the little window in it, and as I
was opening the door for this guy standing outside, I thought, " Why is
someone crouching behind the bushes back there, and why is someone over by
the wall..."
FREEZE! YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR USEPOSSESIONANDDISTRIBUTION OF LSD! Yes,
it was all one word, and I felt like I was suddenly shoved underwater.
Everything was so unreal, time was in slow?fast? motion, and all I thought
was, "Thank God it didn't kick in!". <Jim> and <Joe> had a different
experience, I imagine. The room was full of Security Police with M-16's
pointed at our heads (even though I was cuffed behind my back) and they
ransacked the place. Turns out <Jim's> wife blabbed to a busybody neighbor
who called the First Sargeant who called the Squadron Commander who called
the Office of Special Investigation and in the retelling of the story it
was thought that we were bringing 6000 hits on base, possibly to taint the
water supply! So we go to the base hospital for a piss test and then they
let us walk back home.
NOW it kicks in! Trees start looming at me, lights are streaky and I'm
feeling very giddy.Even though I'm tripping, my mind is very clear, and I
can see how I've just screwed up things in a major way for me, my wife and
2 year old daughter. I related the tale to my wife and told her I had to
lay down for a while and work things out. I curled up in a fetal position
on the bed and closed my eyes. I could see this huge octagonal carpet
suspended in the blackest darkness. The colors blended from one corner to
the next, and I knew that each of the eight corners was emotion;the
burgandy corner was guilt, the maroon was shame, the dark purple was
frustration, and so on. Slowly, one of the corners started to droop down,
and as it did I could feel the associated emotion welling up inside me.
Suddenly the corner plunged into the void and I was wracked with
overwhelming guilt, so much so that I would violently shake and moan on
the bed. My wife came in when she heard this, and I pulled myself out of
it long enough to tell her,"It's alright, I've got to go through this
now.". She left the room and I returned to the floating carpet. After 45
minutes (an eternity, in my time) I came out to the living room, exhausted
and drenched with sweat. The morning sun was about to come up, and I
relaxed into a chair, put on a tape, and to the opening strains of
America's 'Horse with no name' the sun slipped over the horizon and shot
directly, but gently, into my eye.
 
Oh man...I can feel it now... it's so beautiful... God is silently,
insistently saying everything's alright... I can't describe how much light
and love was in me then... and now...
 
Sorry, I'm back. the next few minutes are so bizarre. Suddenly there was
no more music even though it was still playing, somewhere, out there...
all I could think of was how much I loved my daughter and at that instant
my daughter came straight out of her room and climbed into my lap. She
stared long and deep into my eyes and said, "Daddy, you have rainbows in
your eyes" and I realized that I was not made of flesh anymore, I was a
giant, glowing, sunshine-filled diamond, and fear fell away. Pain fell
away. And I was filled with the power of the Universe. Even weeks later I
could feel it. I had the power to look inside people and see their fears
and weaknesses and I knew they were totally powerless against me. Of
course, all the power I had was light and love and all I wanted to do to
people was to love and heal them and bring them into the light. It was
truly magical.
 
The Air Force wasn't done with me yet, though. I went to jail for a few
months, got busted from Staff Sargeant to Airman, money was taken from me,
they made up some shit to get me in hot water with the IRS and are still
making me repay some money they said thay gave me, but all in all, it was
worth it. For a very short time, I WAS 'THERE' and I'd do it all over
again.

=========================================================================
         
The first time I ever tripped it was with my brother at our parent's cottage
in ontario, on lake erie.  a perfect trip setting if ever there was one.  It
had just gotten dark, and this is a rather remote location so when it gets
dark it's DARK.  We were just starting to peak, and were in the process of
building a bonfire, when I glanced up toward the lake and noticed a light on
the horizon.
 
Keep in mind, this is my first time tripping, and I'm having a great
time--laughing my ass off, digging the visuals, etc.
 
anyway, I see this light and sort of stop and start to examine it and figure
out what the hell it is.  Often you could see the lights from ships going by
way out in the lake, and occasionally there would be an oil rig test drilling.
Both these things were sources of light, and considering the warpedness of my
perception, I wasn't sure my light wasn't just a ship or oil rig, but it sure
didn't look at it.
 
As I watched the light, I determined that it wasn't moving horizontally, but
it appeared to be getting bigger!!  closer, maybe, I thought, still figuring
it was some man-made, explainable object.
 
"what the fuck is that?" I asked my brother.
 
At the time I was a college sophmore in computer science, and my brother was a
junior in metalurgical engineering.  Neither one of us was stupid or
especially drawn toward the super-natural.
 
"a ship?" he answered.
 
"it's too big to be a ship, and i think it's getting bigger" I said.
 
now we were both staring at the thing.
 
"a weather baloon maybe" I said, trying as best I could given my mindset to
come up with a rational explanation, when inside I ALREADY KNEW it was a
messenger from another planet!!
 
"no, weather baloons don't glow like that!!" he said.
 
By now the thing was getting really huge, and was obviously glowing with it's
own light.
 
It wasn't a ship.
 
It wasn't an oil rig.
 
It wasn't a weather baloon.
 
"it's a fucking UFO!" I said.
 
my brother tends to be even more skeptical than I when it comes to things of
this nature, but I think he actually agreed with me.
 
I thought to myself, as I watched this glowing disk get bigger and bigger,
brighter and brighter before my eyes, this is it.  This will be mankinds first
contact with an intelligent alien life form.  the occupants of that spaceship,
which is apparently headed straight for us, will come face to face with
humanity, for the first time ever, and we, two tripping fools, will be
humanity's representatives.
 
I was convinced not only that this was going to happen, but that it would be
an historic occasion.  I wasn't afraid; rather I looked forward to being my
species' ambassador to these weary space travellers.  I wasn't even scared
that they were going to take me away; I thought it would be neat to see the
inside of their spaceship.
 
Well, we stared at it for another minute or two, and when it got to the point
where it was obvious that we were looking at a half-disk, I blurted out
"it's the fucking MOON!!!!!!!!!!!!".  We proceeded to roll in the sand
laughing for about a half hour, then continued with our trip.
 

=========================================================================

        I had a trip from hell experience. I was driving up to Milwaukee
to see Jerry Garcia over thanksgiving break. Getting thier about 5 hours
early Me and my friend ran into someone in a Van selling jewlery, chains
and LSD (GO FIGURE!). I bought four and split them with my friend. We
then headed over to the Milwaukee Museam of Art. After going through
thier for a few hours with great enjoyment we left to walk back to the
bradly Center. The building that housed the art was accross the
expressway and you had to walk over the overpass and through a parking
garage. I was starting to really peak and we ended up getting lost
somewhere in leaving the garage and ended up in a construction site.
After working our way through that we got hopelessly lost. Finnally
after getting back near the Bradly center we stoped into a cafe to get
something to eat(don't ask me what made me think I wanted to eat) I
ordered some screwed up combo like onion rings soup and coffee. This old
grouchy lady was the watress and one of two employies. The place was
filled with deadheads. I was dressed fairly conservativly in Jeans and a
sweater. All of them were really messed up. She constantly bitched about
how hard her job was and just in general was rude to everyone.. She
looked at me and said "You are the only normal one in here" at that
point I grimaced and burt out in uncontrolable smiles and laughter. She
then said "I don't know whats going on in here, your crazy too." I tried
to pull my self together and gave my food to a hippie girl who had
nothing to eat and was going in some caravan to california. I walked
over to the Bradly center and was looking for the entrance, we were
waiting up against the wall when two people right up in front of us I
guess asked someone for doses, then three guys dressed as dead heads
tied thier hands together with that plastic psudohandcuff ties and said
, Milwaukee police, your under arrest, operation so and so etc.. this is
where the trip went increasingly down hill. After getting into the
concert Still shook up and with my asthma giving me problems from being
out in the cold so long I listened to I think the first four songs. Then
I was overcome with depression and had to walk out.. I sat on the
interior stairs of the center and cryed, telling my friend what a looser
I thought I was, and how my life was worthless. Then I thought I was
going to quit breathing, I wanted to call the paramedics and go to the
hospital, but my friend talked me out of it, knowing what a mess that
would be.. Finally after about an hour of thinking about everything that
was bad and depressing to think about I pulled myself together. Some
deadhead was so fucked up he fell down the stairs on top of me and by
that time the concert was over. I then went out to my car, did more
mental acrobatics and drove home. I stoped at dennys after getting back
to illinois and order more soup, god knows why?... After attempting to
eat some and drink a little coffee I looked down at my soup, the carots
looked like "Steal Your Face" logos floating in beef broth...
Very Strange... .I really have nothing more to say except that It was a
trip to hell... However I did learn alot from it so I guess the pain
wasn't completly worthless...
 
==================================================================

   Back in the spring of '90, I was attending Drexel University in Philadelphia
, and my roommate and I decided to drop, along with a few buddies who lived up
the hall from us. (This during a period of my life where I had just finished
having a slew of, not bad, but rather unpleasant trips) This was my roommate's
second trip, my 100th? (lost count) Anyway, we were engaged in wide and diverse
activities, like staying in our dorm room and watching TV to the music of Floyd
. Anyway, my roommate and I got antsy and left in his car. He felt fine to driv
e a short distance, he said, so we drove to Fairmont Park. Now, this was about
 3 hours into the trip or so, and around 1:00 in the morning. Anyway, the two
buddies had headed to Fairmont Park, and we looked for them. Feeling *really*
paranoid, because of some shifty characters parked next to our car who kept
staring at us. I'm not rascist, but perhaps they were, and they were black, I'm
white. Anyway, we left our cars, and climbed a rock formation which has a car
underpass under it, and overlooks the river. The lights reflected off the water
twinkling with the currents, providing some real good eye candy. Anyway, we sat
up there and smoked a bowl or two, and were watching the night sky, wondering w
here our buddies were, (and I was paranoid about getting mugged, even though we
had gone there a lot before) when we noticed what the clouds were doing. Even
though it was dark out, we could see the clouds and they were forming right
before our eyes. I have seen this once before straight, but it was nothing like
this...on acid, they kept forming cartoony shapes, like the Escher dragons biti
ng each other's tails, etc., etc. Extremely intense. Anyway, my roommate asked
me what I saw, and what I described to him (as it was happening) was exactly
what he saw. That made it really cool. So he then described what he was seeing,
as it occurred, and I was delighted to find that I *was* seeing what he saw, bu
t it was not suggestion, because I knew what I saw before he described it. All
in all a really weird experience, but I guess you had to be there. Anybody who'
s tripped before should be able to relate to it.
 
Anyway, later on that night, back at the dorm, our buddies met up with us, and
they related to us quite a story. They had gone to Fairmont Park, but further
upriver. They had had beer with them, too. (Don't know why--alcohol is a waste
of time on LSD) So they were feeling esp. paranoid when a cop car drove by
once on the highway with its lights on, then circled back, because he had seen
them, and parked and came over to them. They hid their pot and beer real quick
and *tryed* to sober up. Anyway, the cop asked them if they had seen anyone
suspicious because someone further along the river had been stabbed earlier by
a black man. The real kicker on this story is that two black guys had been
in the same area as my friends, but when the cop car pulled up, one hid under
a car, and another ran into the woods. AND they had come from the same
direction that the cop had said the incident occurred. The cop suggested rather
strongly that my buddies should leave the park, and this was one incident where
 my friends felt that a cop's advice meant something.
 
 
Any other good stories anybody has to relate? E-mail 'em to me, I love to hear
a good trip story, and I have heard dozens of good ones. It's sort of a hobby
of mine; I collect trip stories. I wonder if they gain any worth, like stamps
and baseball cards do, after many many years, or if they are rare?

I'll share the story of my first experience with LSD.  I think you'll enjoy
it.

I was 18, and I had been backpacking through Asia with my father, who had
hidden two hits of blotter inside his camera.  He was planning on finding a
place to give me the LSD as sort of a 'rite-of-passage.'  He himself had
recently had a very minor cocaine related 'heart-episode' and was reluctant
to take any chances with the LSD this time around.

So, about 2 months into our travels, we found ourselves on a houseboat on
Lake Dal in Srinigar, the capital of Kashmir.  Talk about paradise!
 Thousands of beautiful wooden houseboats, canoe-like boats called 'shikaras'
that paddled from houseboat to houseboat selling food, hashish, trinkets
etc....  No motor are allowed on Lake Dal, so it was quiet except for the
sound of eagles screeching, kids playing and the 'Call to Prayer' wafting
periodically through the air.  Indian tea served  in the morning and the
afternoon... Truly paradise.

We're sitting on our houseboat, and a shikara comes up carrying a middle-aged
couple.  The male was standing up in the boat singing an Irish drinking song.
 A real personality.  He was a total blue-collar, pub-scrapping Irishman who
worked for many years as a welder, but discovered that he was a mathematical
genius, put himself through school, and now is a professor at a prestigious
university in England - all the while remaining course, vulgar, happy, and
drunk on whiskey.  In any event, they shared our boat with us and we became
good friends.

We traveled together, the four of us, to Ladakh, the Tibetan region of India,
high in the Himalayas.  We stayed in a village called Leh which was as
Tibetan a village as you could find.

(and before I get flamed for being a stupid tourist, please understand that
this was a number of years ago...  ok - I'll accept the criticism of being a
stupid tourist)

At some point, Dad & I decided that this was the place where I should be
initiated into the world of psychadelics.  I started by taking a quarter of a
hit.  When John (the Irishman) got wind of this, he expressed interest, and
the second hit was given to him.  After about 30 minutes, I felt nothing, so
I took another quarter.  Another 30 minutes passed, another quarter.  I ended
up taking all four quarters = a full hit.

Still nothing had happened.  My father and I climbed up the mountain to a
cemetary above the village.  They call the landscape in this part of Tibet a
'moonscape,' and truly, aside from the whitewashed Buddhist Stupas that
aparently marked graves, it looked as beautiful and desolate as photographs
of the surface of the moon.

The village was below us, a maze of adobe-like buildings and narrow winding
streets.  All of a sudden, something began to change within my body.  I was
feeling a bit of a change.  At that moment, the Call to Prayer for the
villages few moslems began, amplified by a cheap speaker mounted on one of
the village mosque's minarets.  I stood up and a giant grin came over my
face.  I was tripping.

Dad and I walked the winding path down the mountain back into the village,
with me giggling and describing the sensations I was feeling along the way.
 We ran into John who was sitting outside of our rooms looking at flowers.

So there we were - two first time trippers, tripping our balls off in this
village, with shit-eating grins on our faces, smoking bidis like fiends and
generally making fools of ourselves.

I have rarely had acid since that has been as powerful as this was.  Both of
us experienced tremendous distortions in time.  I remember lighting a
cigarette and tripping for an eternity on the surrounding countryside,
returning to my cigarette only to discover that less than a millimeter had
been burned.

The Tibetans new something was up, and there was a constant parade of
beautiful teenage Tibetan girls coming around to flirt with us and watch us.
 We were in a garden-area, and there was a really old guy who seemed to live
in the garden.  He'd kneel in the garden and pray for hours on end, spinning
his prayer wheel.  I can still remember really tripping on the sound of his
wheel spinning around and around.

At some point we ran out of cigarettes and had to make the excursion into the
village to buy more.  Imagine two tripping fools cruising into the Tibetan
equivalent of a 7-11 laughing uncontrollably and trying to buy cigarettes.

The streets were muddy, and as we waled to and from the store, we passed
dozens of strange and exciting people - people leading water buffalo, Tibetan
monks, naked kids, Kashmiri traders and carpet salesmen, etc....  It was like
a circus and it was (naturally) enhanced by the drug.

My father had told me that one thing he really enjoyed when doing LSD was
looking at himself in the mirror and watching the flesh on his face melt off.

Sure enough, when I tried, I got the same results.  I haven't been able to
reproduce it since.  I thought it was hilarious.

Anyway, as often is the case with LSD, after 10 hours or so, it got a little
tiring.  I started coming down and John started getting a little wierd.  I
remember him running down the road saying "The cloud is a fucking fish," or
something like that, then laying down in a field of rubble and laughing and
laughing...

It hasn't been as good as that since.  It sure was a great place to learn
about the power and beauty of LSD.
