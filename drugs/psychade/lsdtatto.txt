        Frequently Answered Question -- What about these "LSD Tattoos?"

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Summary
-------
        The LSD Tattoo urban legend (a.k.a. "Blue Star tattoos," "Mickey
Mouse LSD," et al.) is a classic of the breed.  It is an example of a
"contamination" legend and can be classed with such other familiar legends
as "Spider eggs in Bubble Yum."

        Typically, a school, hospital, or police station will get a copy
of a flier alleging that drug fiends are using a nefarious new technique
to get children hooked on drugs -- they give kids lick-and-stick tattoos
(such as are occasionally found as prizes in Cracker Jack boxes) that
contain LSD.  The LSD is absorbed through the skin, causing all sorts of
unpleasant symptoms, the child becomes hooked, and the dealer has a new
customer.

        The legend has some credibility trouble.  First of all, although
the fliers often list authorities (Beth Israel Medical Center in New
York, the Valley Children's Hospital, "the Police Department," the
Cumberland County Sheriff's Department, "Die New Yorker Polizei," 
"las Autoridades," "Sr. Roch Hospital," "Mr. Guy Chaille, Advisor to the
President," etc.), once contacted (if in fact, they can be; Mr. Guy
Chaille doesn't exist), these authorities tend to deny knowledge of the
alarming problem.

        In addition, LSD is a nonaddictive drug.  There is no such thing
as a "deadly trip" -- a fatal overdose of LSD would be almost
impossible.  The absorption of LSD from blotter paper through the skin
is also extremely unlikely, if not impossible.

        Like all good urban legends, there is a thread of truth in the
magic carpet.  LSD is commonly packaged in sheets of blotter-paper which
are perforated into squares (approx. 1cm x 1cm) which constitute a
"dose" of LSD.  Some LSD manufacturers have trademarks which are printed
on these squares (examples:  Blue Unicorns, Bart Simpson, etc.).  I've
seen a photograph of a square of blotter acid printed with Mickey Mouse
(in his role as the Sorcerer's Apprentice in the movie Fantasia -- a
favorite movie of the psychedelic set).

        One theory as to how the rumors started:  A police report
mentioned lsd doses "stamped with pictures of Mickey Mouse."  The word
"stamped" was transmogrified from a verb into a noun at some point in
the FOAFmission of the story:  "stamps with pictures of Mickey Mouse."
The implication being that when licked, these stamps cause LSD
intoxication.

        Such a genesis-document has been found.  In 1980, the Narcotics
Bureau of the New Jersey State Police sent out a memorandum including
pictures of Mickey Mouse blotter acid, including packaging including
foil, a ziploc bag and a red cardboard box with a picture of Mickey
Mouse on it.  The memorandum uses the word "stamps" to refer to the
pictures stamped on the blotter paper.

        [Jean-Bruno RENARD, in "LSD Cartoon Stamps / Tattoo Transfers:
An Extreme Case of Rumor about Contamination in France" alleges that
another connection between stamps and LSD is that "it is a custom among
LSD users to send small LSD tablets by concealing them underneath the
postage stamps of the letters they send to foreign correspondents."  He
also alleges, but doesn't footnote (dammit!), that "LSD tablets were
found concealed beneath tattoo transfers in California."]

        A Seventh-Day Adventist church community wrote and propagated a
flier in 1980 using information from the police memorandum, and the
legend was on a roll.  Like a virus, this flier was highly contageous
and subject to mutations that would make it more virulent.

        Legends about drug dealers trying to hook children on drugs with
"free samples" and other nefarious means have been around for a long
time, and it was natural that there would be some cross-fertilization.

        Eventually, someone gets a bee in his/her bonnet and types out a
warning.  Some police department somewhere makes a drug bust in which
the "blue stars" trademark is found, another finds "Bart Simpson," each time
the legend gets more elaborate.

        By 1987, the fliers include references to "Blue Star,"
"butterflies, clowns, red pyramids, and colored microdots."  LSD is now
alleged to be able to cause "a fatal `trip'" and strychnine is included
in some stamps (strychnine in acid is an old faithful urban legend,
surfacing regularly in alt.drugs).

        "Windowpane" acid and "Microdot" are not trademarks, but are
different carrier media for the drug (i.e. not blotter paper).  Windowpane
is a gelatin-base, whereas Microdot is the drug in a pill or capsule form.

HOW DO THEY SPREAD???

Well-meaning folks see the fliers, which have enough of a smell of truth
about them, and feel as if they are doing a good deed by spreading the
story around.  After a few bad xeroxes, the fliers get retyped.  The new
versions are usually slightly different, which enables urban-legend fans
to track the progress and origin of new epidemics through pseudo-genetic
means.

"You feel like if it's happening, you want to let parents know.  We
didn't make a big issue of it, but we wanted to pass it along."
        -- Eileen Deck, Principal of St. Anthony's Catholic School
           in El Segundo, Calif.

"I was really concerned about this.  I photocopied it and gave it out to
some parents."
        -- Rose Walsh, worker at Gander Daycare

"With drugs, if you're going to err, it's better to do so on the side of
extreme caution."
        -- Carla Gordon, Riverside County, Calif., Sheriff's Detective

"I felt that if it was something that concerned the safety and
well-being of our students, then the parents ought to know about it."
        -- King Walker, Principal of Normandie Christian School in
           South Central Los Angeles, Calif.

"I was shocked.  I thought about the youngsters and the children who are
entrusted to me.  My spontaneous reaction prevented me from verifying
the veracity of this `information.'  My good faith was abused and I may
have been careless."
        -- Pr. Jasmin, a dentisty professor in Nice, France.
