( This is long detailed description of the affects of Morning Glory 
  seeds, which I hope Ya'all will find interesting. if you'd rather
  read about whether smoking in ones car causes more accidents, or
  flame Ed, hit 'n' now)
 
   Seeing as there were a few questions on Morining Glory seeds, and seeing
As I *have* tried them, I thought I'd pass along some tips I've garnered
on consuming them, as well as a description of the high. 
 
    Earlier this year, I downloaded the 'Natutal-High' FAQ. The description
of Morning Glory seeds, as well as earlier discussion about them on the
net (last year some people described their experiences with them) prompted
me to take them. (I've never tried LSD, and the FAQ said that the seeds
constained LSA, some sort of chemical cousin of LSD. This added further 
impetus to my desire to try them.)
 
    Based on my own empirical testing of the commonly available MG seeds,
the ones labeled 'Heavenly Blue' are the ones you want. The other seed
types seemed to have little physchoative affect. I purchased the seeds 
from two different companies Northrop King (NK), where the seed origin
is Holland, and Olds, which grows their seed here in my hometown (Madison
WI.). The easiest time to find MG seeds (or most other commonly sold seeds)
is in the Spring, when they are sold at supermarkets, hardware stores, etc.
 
    Play it safe. Before you consume the seeds, wash them. This is not to 
prevent nausea, because even untreated MG seeds are probably going to make 
you feel sick. The LSA, and the chemicals that make you feel sick are all
there *because* the plant does not want you eating its seeds. Washing them 
removes any dirt and fungacides which may be on the seeds - things 
you probably don't want to eat. 
 
    I used a strainer (the kind used for noodles) to clean the seeds. Place
all the seeds in the strainer and run luke warm water over them for a minute
or two. You might want to use a little dishwashing liquid too. After washing
them, its time to consume them. The FAQ said LSA is water soluble, so ideally
you would grind up the seeds (a pepper grinder works well) and soak them in
water. Soak the seeds for an hour or two. Strain the water through a coffee 
filter and drink the blackish-green water. Alas, in my own experience 
(described below) the effect of the seeds is much stronger if you actually 
drink the ground up seeds with the water.
 
    I've tried MG seeds on three occasions, all within a two week period a 
about a month ago. The first time a friend and I consumed five 1.5 gram 
packs between us. We ground up the seeds and put them in tea bags, which 
we soaked in hot water for about 10 minutes. After a few hours we both 
concluded that they had done little for us. We both just felt a liitle
'weird' for a few hours. On the up side, neither of us felt sick after
drinking our 'tea'.
 
        Being the stubborn person that I am (I am a programmer after all ;-) ) 
I was determined to see if there was anything to MG seeds. On the second 
occasion I consumed six 1.2 ounce packs of seeds. On this occasion
I ground up the seeds and put soaked them in some water for about an hour.
I then drank the entire mess. In anticipation of feeling sick, I hopped
on my bicycle (it was a cold spring night) and rode around the city. I
had been hoping that the bike riding would keep my mind off any sickness.
 
        I started to feel sick after about half an hour. It started to get real
bad (the nausea) after 45 minutes. I had brought some pot with me just in
case, and after smoking a little almost all the nausea went away. 
Unfortunatley, I was now high, so I could't really observe the MG seeds
as they came on :-). After about an hour I still felt nothing (besides being
high) and concluded prematurely that the seeds had done nothing. However,
As I was riding home, I began to feel *real* weird. My field of view seemed
to expand, and the entire sky looked enourmous. The bike ride home was
fantastic. I really can't explain the high -- I now understand why people
say you can't describe LSD to people who have never used it. The affects
wore off after about four hours, but I had a lot of trouble sleeping
that night.
 
        On the third occasion I was with my brother. This time I tried NINE
1.5 gram packs of ONLY heavenly blue seeds. Note that on the other two
times I had mixed different types of seeds. My brother tried only other
varieties of seeds. Again I ground up the seeds, soaked them in some water,
and drank the entire mix. This was to be the start of a huge, often
unenjoyable trip for me. My brother (who *has* tried acid) said that he 
felt very little (that's why I recommend the Heavenly Blue seeds), but
that what he did feel was like the end of an acid trip.
 
    About an hour after eating the seeds, I began to feel sick. (we ate
the seeds at about eight at night). I would feel sick on and off during the
entire trip until about six in the morning, when I finally blew chunks. This
did not, however, end the trip.
 
    The affects of the high/trip came on very gradually, over some hours.
After staying with my brother for a few hours, I decided to try to bike home.
This was something of a mistake. Riding home was difficult, as everything 
seemed strange and alien. I ride my bike a lot (I don't own a car) yet
even my bike seemed foreign -- I had trouble telling where my body ended
and the bike began. I also started experiencing visual hallucinations --
I saw red and green lights and my vision seemed soft and fuzzy. As cars passed
by me, their headlights seemed to shine through the back of my head. I also
started to get *real* paranoid and self-conscious.
 
    When I got to my apartment, I saw that my roommate was still up. I was
feeling so weird and paranoid that I felt I couldn't deal with talking to him.
So I wandered around my neighborhood late at night on my bike, paranoid
sick and tripping. That part was truly awfull. I began to worry that 
that the seeds had been treated with Mercury and that I had permanently
lost my mind. After what seemed like days (actually only about an hour) I 
returned to my apartment, where to my relief I found my roommate had gone 
to bed. Feeling I might throwup, I went to the bathroom. In the mirror I
noticed that my pupils were fully dialated, and I spent several hours looking
at myself in the mirror. Near the end of this time the skin all over my
body seemed to be moving and crawling as I looked at it. This scared me
pretty bad, so I went to my room to try to sleep. (I still don't know whether
or not my skin was actually crawling, but it sure looked like it.)
 
    I coulnd't sleep - my bed, the room, everything was wrong. Also, I
kept seeing these strange lights - not really in the room, but more inside
myself. Some of them were pretty ornate and seemed to be moving. This
may sound cool, but it was *extremely* unpleasant. At that time I would
have given anything to stop the experience and roll over and go to bed.
Around 6:00 in the morning I finally hurled, but I still felt weird. The
REALLY STUPID thing was that I did this during a weekday, and I had to 
go to work the next day. Not having slept at all, I went into work still
feeling pretty shook up, but I made it through the day.
 
    Overall it was a pretty nasty experience. I guess you'd say I had a 
bad trip. On the plus side, I did have a few interesting thoughts.
The old philosophical mind/body problem seemed to become a non-problem.
At one point while I was looking at myself in the mirror, and struggling
with my nausea, the sick feeling suddenly became entirely a mental phenomena. 
I came to see my body as a mental thing, merely an extension or lower 
part of my entire being. This was something I actually experienced, not
just an intellectual realization. So rather than having ones mind a product
of the body/brain it seemed just the opposite to me.
 
        Also, I found myself thinking about the quote from (I think) Socrates
which goes something something like 'All I know is that I know nothing'.
I know this may sound sophomoric, but the truth of this statement dumb-
founded me. All our knowledge of 'things' or phenomena is ultimately
relative, referring to other things or phenomena. Science is just
a more rigorous way of classifying/observing/predicting things. But
ultimately we remain completely stupid -- we can never know what something
is. This seemed a fundamental truth, no matter how advanced we ever get
technologically. The world seemed like a very crazy, random, chaotic place -
like a giant zoo, with everybody living in it for completely different
reasons. These thoughts really depressed me at the time.
 
        Phew. Well, this has gotten long. In conclusion, I don't know if I'll
ever try MG seeds again. The length of my last experience with them, plus
the nausea and depression outweighed the positive aspects of it. If MG
seeds are at all like LSD (which I haven't tried), its probably easier
just to stick to acid. However, if you do try them, I'd recommend taking
no more than six 1.5 gram packs of seeds.

After reading the FAQ and seeing another article on morning glory seeds I got
off the new archive, I wanted to try them. Well last Friday night I had
nothing to do. My buddy I usually hang out with was out of town and I was
looking at a very boring evening. So I decided, "what the hell," and I went
to the local supermarket and bought five 1.8 gram packs of Heavenly Blue
morning glory seeds. I wanted to grind them up and put them in water, but I
don't have a pepper grinder so I dumped the five packs into a baggie, took my
hammer and attempted to smash them outside on a tree stump. Well, of course,
the bag simply broke and seeds started to scatter. I don't think I lost a
substantial amount, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I just said, "f--k it," and
chewed the seeds. It was about 9 pm at this point. As I was chewing the
seeds, a friend dropped by with some alcohol. "Cool," I thought, at least
I'll have some company now. This friend also informed me that he had tried
morning glory seeds once and had only gotten sick to his stomach with no
psycadelic effect. But no, I wouldn't be daunted that easily.

Before I go on to describe the effects of the seeds, I feel the need to say
that I've never tried acid, but I have eaten shrooms on several occasions. So
all my comparisons will be to shrooms. Well, my friend and I made some fairly
strong margaritas and were sitting outside on the lawn smoking and drinking.
After about an hour and 2 margaritas (probably about 4 shots of tequila) I
started to feel really, really stoned. I felt like I'd done a few bong hits
of really good kind bud and drank a few beers along with it. My limbs were
really heavy, I kind of felt like I was moving in slow motion, you know, a
good high. At this point I lost track of time so I can't say how long things
took at this point except for the couple of times I looked at a clock.

After sitting out on the lawn a while more, we got cold and went inside. I
lied back on the couch and started staring at the ceiling. At this point it
felt like shrooms do when they start coming on. I have really great textured
walls and ceilings where I live that produce great effects when tripping. So
I watched the ceiling ripple and watched the ridges sway and move about a
bit. Let me point out that the hallucinations were very mild. It only felt
like the beginnings of a mushroom trip and nothing like I understand acid to
be. It was definately pleasent though. Although it was to a lesser degree
than shrooms, I got the feeling I always get that everything is perfect and
in its place and exactly as it should be. Well it turns out that this would
be the height of my "trip."

I got tired of staring at the ceiling fairly quickly, (something that doesn't
happen on shrooms) and my friend and I moved into my bedroom where we started
watching some TV. After a little TV I felt that I was beginning to come down.
I got this incredible desire to watch The Wall, so at about midnight I put
the tape in. I've watched The Wall when coming down from shrooms and I know
that the coming down period lasts much longer then it takes to finish the
movie. But the seeds had pretty much worn off by about 3/4 of the way
through. (Somewhere around Comfortably Numb.) It was probably somewhere
between 1 and 1:30 at that point.

Well the rest of the night isn't worth telling. Nothing more exciting
happened. Although I will point out two things. I was very restless after the
seeds wore off. I was wide awake and ready to go do something. Also,
apparently the seeds hadn't completely worn off until I woke up the next day.
For right before I finally went to bed at about 7 am, I stopped and looked at
my couch intensely for a bit. After a few seconds of staring, lo and behold
the fabric of my couch starting rippling and wavering and generally shifting
around. So some remnant of the seeds were still in my system ten hours after
I initially ate them.

My final analysis of the seeds is that they were worth doing. The seeds cost
me $5. In relation to other drugs they probably don't provide as much bang
for the buck. But I haven't been able to get my hands on any acid or shrooms
recently. And that $5 provided more entertainment than alcohol or a movie or
anything of that sort. What it felt like was a very mild shroom trip. In
fact, it was very similar to the time I ate shrooms two nights in a row and
the second night was very mild. The main difference from a mild shroom trip
was that I didn't get quite the same "warm fuzzy" feeling. There were a few
times of mild anxiety with the seeds. I think I'm going to try the seeds
again but I will increase the dosage. I'm a little wary of doing this,
though, because both sources I have from the net recommend no more than 9 or
10 grams, which is what I ate. Maybe I'll try 6 or 7 packs next time.

Oh yeah, one more thing. I suffered no nausia (sp?). The only side effect was
some pretty nasty diaharrea (sp?). But even that was short lived, it was gone
by the time I woke up the next morning.

I just thought I would relate a brief personal experience with Morning
Glory.  This is not my first negative experience, but this was by far
the worst.

10:00pm  Washed off store bought seeds (in a vain attempt to remove any
        fungicide).   Started to grind them

10:45pm  With a very, very tired arm, I was done grinding them.  I put
        them in water and let them soak, stirring occasionally.  Took
        1 dramamine.

11:30pm  Poured the liquid through a coffee filter, then drank it.  It didn't
        taste or smell badly.

12:30pm Felt a little buzz, and a little sick.

1:30pm   Visited my friend, the toilet.  Felt slightly better, went back
        to my room.

1:45pm   Dropped by to visit the toilet again.

4:00pm   Still at the somewhat strange looking toilet, drinking water
        so I could have something to puke.  Dry heaving had grown old...

5:00pm  Fell asleep, hoping I would not choke on my own vomit.


It's been about a week, and my digestive system has still not fully recovered.


Just thought I'd give an experience to those thinking to try it.... :)

        A slight uncertainty arises as to where to start my explanation of
this experience, because it eventually seemed to have found root in events
months before it actually took place. Nonetheless, I will do my best to
accurately describe the facts in rough chronological order, and to denote any
comments that I am adding as hindsight, as opposed to events/thoughts of the
time.  I expect that I'll still be remembering things that I left out for a
few weeks after I finish this file, but I hope it's relatively thorough.  This
may read a little choppily, because as I remember new things, I have to pick
where to place an account of them, but do your best - I'm posting this so that
the alt.drugs.veterans can anylize this experience to death.  It was
unbelievably powerful, and I'd like to hear as much as I can about it.  I came
out of it with a wonderful outlook on life, partly because of the realizations
I had about my life and the problems with it, party because I felt that I had
found the answers to most of those problems, and partly because I was still
alive at the end of it all.

        My recreational legal drug use had never produced what I would refer
to as a "trip", but instead, a wide array of buzzes, nothings, highs, stones
and such.  Mostly sensual experiences, with a dash of thought alteration,
basically.  I longed to experience the altered perception and psychadelia
documented in so many books, posts, and files I had collected.  I had always
prided myself in my habit of thoroughly researching a substance to the point
at which I could surprise almost anyone I met with a fact about it before I
would even consider ingesting it.  I've always had very clear boundaries
between substances: those I do/would use if given the chance, those I avoid at
all costs, and those on which I have yet to gain enough information.

        I had put D-lysergic acid amide on my list of substances on which I
had sufficient information to warrant experimentation, and apparently this was
either a premature assumption, or I made a few errors. Regardless, I ingested
7.2 grams of Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds, which should be approximately
280 seeds.  This was done over the course of about 45 minutes, and I had
another 1.8 grams to round it off to 9 handy when the phone rang.  The phone
conversation was more important to me than the last 70 seeds, so I talked.
About an hour later, at 9:45, I was tripping.
 
        I couldn't decide whether to lie down on my bed or sit up on its edge,
and my constant motion was a bit of a problem to the phone conversation,
because the phone in my bedroom rattles when moved.  To make things worse, I
couldn't stop trying to describe the breathing of the walls and the
multicolored mirrored spheres I saw spinning out to no end when I closed my
eyes.  It was thoroughly breathtaking, and I was almost giddy by the time we
decided to hang up, about 3 minutes later.  This left me free to watch the
happenings around me.  The breathing walls were neat, and somewhat of a sign
to me that I had done it - this was to be a fun ride.  But more profound were
the mirror balls.  Closing my eyes produced a vision as if I were literally
surrounded by floating silver spheres which were slowly rotating around each
other, and reflecting far-off shapes of red, yellow, and green.  I could have
watched them all night, but I had other plans.

        I was still coherent enough to brush my teeth and wash my face, and I
did so.  I went out into the living room to get my CD player, and carefully
returned to my room.  My CD player hadn't been working consistently, but my
other choice was to carry my stereo down the hallway, and I didn't trust my
vision or coordination well enough for that.  I expect that it still wasn't
working, but I was too far gone to care.  Anyhow, I plugged in the player,
took off my shirt, carefully put the little Morning Glory bags into a drawer,
and searched for Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  It took me a long time
to focus on the CDs well enough to pick it out, but eventually located it.  I
was unbelievably anxious to lie in my bed, close my eyes, and listen to my
music, and I remember smiling like an idiot through the entire preparation
process.  When I had finished, I put out the lights, applied my headphones,
slipped into bed, and pressed "Play".
 
        If only I had videotaped myself.  I spent the following 42 minutes 57
seconds listening to one of my favorite albums as if I had never heard music
before, and freely associating every concept that came into my mind with every
other that I had pondered that evening.  My thoughts were racing, and I seemed
to be pointing to them with various body parts as they passed me.  I'm not
sure how to best convey this concept, but as I connected my thoughts, I
attempted to whisper them to myself, and they were speeding by at such a rate
that the only things I spoke were along the lines of "O.k.- and then-  but
that means- so that- but- ha!- and- ha!" and I would preceed to emit a
whispered gasp of understanding, as if connecting these thoughts had explained
a major portion of my life.  Occasionally, I would decide that it would be
best if I calmed down and slept, but that could only last for a few seconds,
for as I would begin to ponder the act of calming down to sleep, I would whirl
into another episode of free association.

        Each of the connecting phrases I muttered (and then, but that means,
so that...) was accompanied by a physical movement.  My movements had become
very smooth, things such as running my fingertips down my face, wrapping my
arms slowly around myself, bringing my knees up to a rough fetal position and
then back... All very fluid, smooth motions.  But, when my thoughts were
jumping, each jump seemed to be accompanied by a single muscle moving, and
each of my limbs was accomplishing its current goal in motion by waiting for
one of its muscles to get its turn to move. At the time, I was only aware of a
singular sensation of motion that was felt first in a leg, then an arm, then a
foot, and such, but when I gasped with understanding at the end of my line of
thought, I would find my arms twisted into unnatural positions around my body
and each other.  I occasionally took breaks for breath (I was gasping out all
these thoughts to myself, and my breathing was abnormal enough as it was
without trying to keep quiet) or to feel my face, shake my hair (it felt
different every time I did that, but it usually felt like only a comparatively
few thin flowing strands, and it was electrifying to feel it rub against my
back) and play with other sensual abnormalities of the trip.  I was not tired
in the least, and this continued until the last track on the CD.

        Apparently, I picked a bad time to try to settle down and sleep,
because at the moment I stopped thinking wildly, "Eclipse" began to play.  I
had already been making seemingly astouding discoveries about everything I
knew, and anyone who knows the lyrics to Eclipse is aware of the connection
therein.  Basically, I was now told that Everything I touch, see, taste, feel,
love, hate, distrust, save, give, deal, buy, beg, borrow, or steal, All I
create, destroy, do, say, eat, everyone I meet, all that I slight, everyone I
fight, all that is now, all that is gone, all that's to come, and everything
under the sun is in tune - but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.  Awaiting that
ending, each line sobered me as I became very... wary.  Not frightened, but
aware of the depth of the experience, I guess.  I'm not certain how to
describe it, but I was laying there astonished at something, and when the song
ended, I very slowly and almost absentmindedly removed my headphones.  My mind
was, in effect, blown.

        From this point, my chronological order is likely to be less than
accurate.  I honestly cannot recall what happened next, but I vaguely remember
the same sort of racing thought I had just expereinced, but more slowly.  The
topics seemed to be drawing to a close, and not towards an end I wanted to
reach.  I could do nothing to stop it, so I was forced to lie there and watch
my mind connect thoughts that I was just as willing to forget.  The visuals at
this point were very vivid, but I regret that I cannot specifically explain
any of them.  They were basically graphical representations of the thoughts I
was having.  Finally, my thoughts had all been connected to form only a few
basic concepts which I preceeded to intertwine to form one.  Suddenly,
everything was before me.

        I felt as if I was faced with a choice.  I could see a swirling
representation of everything that exists, interacting with everything else
that exists to form an everything that was itself as well as its parts.  I
understood what this collection of things I saw in front of me represented -
it was an omniscience that COULD stem from the realizations I was having that
night.  I had been lucky enough to be given the decision, apparently, but it
was not an easy one.  I could either leap forward into the all-knowing mass of
everything before me, or make my way back to my home, and to this reality.  I
felt as if understanding all there was to know would be a method of nullifying
my existence, because there would be nothing towards which to climb, but also
that returning to my reality was a "death" of some sort.  I'm not certain what
it was that I feared, but I felt certain that I was risking death by
returning.  (Perhaps I was seeing the omniscience as a form of immortality - I
do seem to remember a sense that it would be a connection with an all-powerful
consciousness)...  I chose to return, although I do not recall actively making
the decision (I'm tempted to think that the drug was simply wearing off).  I
do have a vague memory of visualizing all the thoughts I had intertwined
rapidly untangling, as I recursively regressed to the point at which I began -
my mind had many many different concepts to consider, and they were not all
connected.  It was quite a bit of work to return, but eventually, I opened my
eyes, and saw my room.
 
        Well, it was SORT of my room.  Almost everything was out of place,
with the exception of the clock.  The clock insisted on misbehaving, and I
often found that two checks of the clock that seemed to be in rapid succession
produced readings of 1:30 and then 1:55, for instance.  My first goal was to
slow the clock down, or speed it up, whichever it happened to need, until it
was correct, so I could form some sort of an anchor to something roughly
tangible.  Finally, when I was convinced that I was relatively back to
reality, I was brave enough to roll over and look at the floor.

        There was my CD player, next to my headset, and the cord strewn over
the general vicinity.  I reached for the cord, and touched nothing but carpet.
I looked again, and realized that I hadn't reached for the cord, but for part
of the sculpture of the carpet.  Suddenly, the floor was different - I was
better oriented, I could see where the cord actually was.  I pieced my room
back together this was, noting when my senses were and weren't correct, being
extremely proud over having changed something physically and having it remain
changed when I returned to it.  The next step was my bed covers.  The turning
and twisting I was doing over the course of my thoughts had twisted up my
sheets rather nicely, so I decided to untwist them.  My sheets are covered
with irregular stripes, and in my current state, these were very misleading. I
untwisted completely four times before it was actually physically completely
untwisted.  When I felt the bottom sheet form a consistantly flat covering
over me, I was even better oriented.  It was now, I decided, well past time to
get up, use the bathroom, and get a drink.

        I turned to my door.  I reached out to grab its edge, but my hand
seemed to roll around a fourth side before I could see where the actualy three
I was concerned with were.  I pulled, and was startled by a loud knocking
sound.  I looked around, and noticed my hairbrush near the door's path.  As a
reality check, I closed the door, mover the brush, and re-opened the door.  It
did not knock. I was proud.  I closed the door, stood up, and replaced my
clothing on my body.  Feeling the sensations of fabric running along my skin
replaced much of my anchor in reality, also.  I quietly opened the door again,
and walked down the hallway.  I walked into the bathroom, and my perspectives
in there helped set me straight, because the bathroom was one of the last
rooms I visited before the LSA took.  The shower curtain, the sink, the tile,
my sister's little jar of sea monkeys in the corner...  They all seemed right,
and I knew I was closer.  The only thing that startled me was the cloth above
me and to my left.  I stared at the designs, though, and realized that my
mother had hung wet clothing over the curtain rod to dry, and this reminded me
that time had gone on even after I'd closed my bedroom door the evening
before.  Things looked promising, but I was still in my own little altered
state, not actively noticing the things around me.  I left the bathroom and
went further down the hallway to the kitchen.

        Without filling in any details of the parts of the kitchen itself,
relevant to this action or not, I did nothing but the following: I got a
glassful of juice.  It wasn't until I took a large drink that I realized
everything around me - and it was exactly as it should have been.  The juice,
however, was not from the same fruit as that which I had been drinking with my
seeds, and the new taste surprised me - waking me to my surroundings.  I was
quite impressed that this had such an effect, and I went around touching
things..  The dog's leash, the microwave, the table.  I read a bit of the
newspaper.  I had to get back to bed, I decided.

        My room was still foreign, however, and I had some reality to set back
into place.  I had made quite a few things in my room do what they should, but
I still could not form one clear picture of my surroundings.  I spend the time
to come playing with objects, re-learning their tendencies, and interaction
with other objects. For instance, one of the more interesting was when I saw
my juggling bags on the floor.  I picked one up, tossed it and caught it, and
finally decided to toss it off the edge of the bed.  It landed on the ground
with a thud, and I became more aware of gravity, and where the floor was.  I
played with my clock radio, making it pop with noise by turning on the radio
with no volume.  I turned the light on and off a few times.  I opened my door
and did the same, feeling it necessary that I was vulnerable to being "caught"
while doing this.  (I would suggest that since I quite often have a very real
sense of where my family is, and whether or not they can discover me in any
act they would not approve of, I was attempting to create a little mild
paranoia to which I could relate).

        Throughout this entire ordeal, there were a few things that recurred.
For isntance, When the room was particularly silent, I could hear my watch on
the bedside table.  Its band has been broken for ages, and thus it's well
buried by other bedside table-type items, and I wasn't used to hearing it.  In
order to concentrate on it, I would mutter "ticktickticktickticktickticktick".
I quite often looked myself over, to see how familiar I looked, and I
occasionally would find it necessary to sepecifically check the familiarity of
my genitals (with and without the door open).  One of the strangest actions
was tickling my gag relfex.  It wasn't as responsive as it usually would be,
and I think that the closer it came to responding as I was accustomed, the
closer I felt to reality. Occasionally, I would feel something unfamiliar,
like a 1mm thick disk, I think, and reach for it, but it would always fall
farther down my throat, and I felt as if I were curling my finger into my
throat, through my tounge, and back around in a full spiral.  I finally
stopped this habit by staring into my throat via my mirror while doing this,
and at first my throat appeared as a terrifying cavern of death, but it
gradually became the back of my mouth as I remembered it. Rubbing my hand over
my face to confirm that it was the face I remembered would (naturally)
occasionally cause my hand to brush over my lips, and the feeling reminded me
of a specific intimate encounter of the past. Also, I noticed that my inner
lip produced a much more smooth sensation across my hand than I would expect
from saliva.  Whatever I pictured myself doing, I would proceed to do, because
I knew that confirming the images in my mind was the only way to convince
myself that I was perceiving things as they were.

        I finally turned away from the room, and towards myself.  I looked in
the little mirror on my headboard, and I did not recognize my physical self as
it currently is.  I reminded myself of the 7th grade me, except my hair was as
it currently is.  The most profound differences were my facial features, and
the presence of a large amount of acne that wasn't there when I went to sleep.
I tenatively rubbed one of the pimples I saw, and found nothing but flat skin.
Good.  I felt my entire forehead and face for bumps, and found my complexion
was much clearer than the mirror suggested. I looked back, and I was a much
closer to normal.  I looked back at my floor, to re-confirm the stability of
reality, and noticed my CD player.  I pressed play, and when I heard sound, I
picked up the headphones.  I didn't wear them, but I moved them around, and
oriented myself to the sound.  It helped tremendously, as did proving that I
could change things by playing with the skip/search buttons.  Finally, I
stopped, and removed the CD.  I looked at it, had some profound thoughts about
creative energy in the mind, glanced at my guitar, and then back at the CD.  I
turned it around, to see my face in the back, and what I found was a small,
frightened, unfamiliar face with meek features.  Suddenly, the face rapidly
transformed into dozens and dozens of other unfamiliar faces, until I looked
away, and placed the CD in its jewel box.  I looked in my mirror, and I saw my
face.  Comfort.  But suddenly, the right half of the mouth in the mirror
twisted into the most angry snarl I'd ever seen on my face, and then quickly
calmed to normal.  The left half followed suit, but this was more feirce.
Finally, I physically curled my face into an ugly, angry snarl, and silently
roared, feeling a large amount of negative energy being dispersed in that act.
I could tell that this was nerely over.

        Suddenly, however, I began feeling that, even though I'd regained most
of my reality, that I might have caused some sort of permanent psychosis.  I
wondered if it would be too late to save me, or if there was still time, or
perhaps if there would only be time if I sought help immediately.  I was faced
with the issue of coming to my parents about the night's experiement.  I
suddenly felt that I had no choice but to tell them, but there was still
enough sense in me not to.  I knew that this would HAVE to wear off, but I
also wasn't certain what would be left behind.  I opened my door again, and
sat down on the carpet before the tile of the hallway.  I breathed.  It was a
very liquid, unfamiliar breath.  I suddenly decided to breathe very rapidly.
And the quiet sound of my hyperventalation produced a spinning sound in my
head as if the noise were actually produces by a large spinning wheel that
made little gasping noises periodically.  The sensation reminded me of the
sensation I had earlier on in the trip of many small things meshing together
to form a large whole.  My breathing returned to normal, and I began to cry. I
hadn't cried in a long time (I'd needed to, I think...) and it was a very
heartfelt cry.  I was careful not to bawl and wake people up, because sitting
in my door put me within a meter of my parent's door.  It was a gasping, teary
cry.  I rubbed my eyes, and the moistness reminded me specifically of the
sensation I had earlier rubbing my had inside my lip.  I had some
philosophical realization about the connection between my intimate activites,
drug activities, and the sorrow/pain I was crying for.  After 5 minutes, I
calmed down.
        
        I got up, took one more trip to the bathroom, and while there, my ears
were bombarded with sounds.  I recognized my parents' TV, which I had turned
off as soon as I was coherent enough to do so.  My father's alarm clock, which
wouldn't be going off this early, was buzzing in my head.  My families voices
were audible in the far distance, and I realized that I'd been hearing them
throughout the past hour or two.  I was a bit afraid that I wasn't perceiving
anything correctly, and they were in fact right over me trying to wake me, or
something of the sort.  Finally, though, I left the bathroom, checked their
room, and they were still asleep, the television off, the alarm silent.  I
smiled.  Things were right, things were good.  I walked back to my room.
Looking it over, I realized that it was back in order, I checked the clock - I
had a couple hours of sleep ahead of me.  I stared at my bed.

        I slid into my bed, and as I did, I could see, hear, and feel the
remaining uncertainties and inconsistancies of my surroundings disappearing as
the sheets sliding down my arms produced the most familiar feelings I'd felt
all night.  I slept.

        I was out looking for a nice pussy willow to plant in the back yard
when I saw them - Heavenly Blue MG seeds, $1.00/2gm pack. What the hell.
I bought 6.

        I looked up prior postings and decided that 8gm would be a decent dose.
I washed the seeds (they look like elongated peppercorns) in a bowl with warm
water and a tiny bit of dish soap, then rinsed them well in a strainer. I ate
a couple and waited a half hour, to see if there were any surprises - there
weren't - so I ground the seeds real fine in a coffee grinder, mixed them with
water in a glass, and let is soak for another 1/2 half hour or so.

        I drank the liquid, refilled the glass, and waited some more...

        Mild effects, minor visuals, mild nausea...

        Drank the liquid again. Tasted much stronger this time, sort of like
peanuts, sort of like magic mushrooms...

        Got progressively more nauseous. Finally used my finger to puke,
and puked and puked and puked and lay down on the floor and puked and puked.
Awful. Tripping now, too, great fun... I could see how a novice could TOTALLY
lose it under these conditions. Nausea didn't feel like nausea anymore, it
felt like twitchy anxiety and impending panic, then I'd puke and be totally
fine for 5 minutes. (My life became a phrase: PUKE = GOOD).

        The trip that followed was actually nice, though - no visuals, 
but nice emotional experience and a zoomy head. Hardly worth it, however...

        An interesting point - an unusual aspect of this was that stimulation
was generally unpleasant - I wanted to be in a dark, quite place, with my
woman around talking but not touching me. I felt twitchy, and I didn't
want to move my head at all. I did the whole trip in bed...

        Moral of the story: Acid is only $2.00 a hit.

    It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon, and we had a plan.  Well, okay, 
we didn't really have one, but we had several goals, a car, and even a 
little bit of money.  So it was that I found myself at Stein Gardens and 
Gifts with two of my close friends, scanning what remained for the summer 
of their seed rack. Our eyes were caught by some "Beautiful Sky Blue 
Flowers" (according to the packaging) that were being sold for $1.99 per 
package of 6 grams.  This was definitely the best price we had ever seen, 
and we decided to purchase 3 packages - 9 grams for each of the two of us 
that possessed interest in the usage of the seeds.  We walked out of the 
store with 18 grams of Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds and a Nut Roll 
candy bar.  After giving a quick shake to the rubber hand that has been so 
deftly placed to hang out of the trunk of my friend's car, we entered the 
vehicle and proceeded to the shopping mall.
 
    First of all, we seized the opportunity to search for new reading 
material at WaldenBooks.  The next stop was Kohl's Department Store, where 
we quickly made our way to the kitchen supply department.  Our last 
endeavor with these seeds included a rather silly period during which, for 
lack of a better means, we found ourselves sitting around a piece of 
cardboard, taking at the seeds with various sundry items (a hammer, a "C" 
size battery, an N2O cracker). While this had proved entertaining, we were 
rather joyful to exit Kohl's with a lovely $8.99 Mr. Dudley "Princess" 
pepper grinder.  After acquiring some delicious cookies of the macadamia 
nut-containing variety, we left the mall to check in at my home, gleefully 
grinding the included peppercorns wherever our path led (we had to empty it 
_somehow_!).
 
    At my house, I filled my bag with a change of clothes, some coffee 
filters (to replace the paper towling of our last attempt - a successful 
attempt, but cumbersome, at best), some plastic bags to fill with the 
product of the grinder, a toothbrush, and 3.6 more grams of seeds whose 
presence in my drawer I had hitherto neglected to remember.  10.8 grams of 
seeds for each of us - it was bound to be a good night.  We returned to the 
apartment of my companion for the night's journey (who will henceforth be 
referred to as "Zworfin"), and set about our work.
 
    The two that would not be partaking of our potion (the one who had gone 
shopping with us, who will henceforth be referred to as "Jarquom", and the 
person living with Zworfin, who will henceforth be referred to as 
"Prulict") left for Taco Bell.  After the first (approximately) 6 grams, 
our "Princess" jammed up, and became stuck in the "closed" position.  Enter 
cardboard, hammer, Energizer, and Duracell.  Eventually, we had two piles 
of fine white powder with black specks, each massing approximately 10.8 
grams, and some Nacho Supreme.  At 8:30PM, We carefully placed the piles of 
powder into two empty Ice Mountain bottles (chosen for the easy pouring 
associated with a beverage bottle's neck) with some rather warm water, and 
not-so-carefully ate our suppers for the evening, and set about watching 
the breathtaking thunderstorm the night had given us, while occasionally 
stirring our concoctions.
 
    It was interesting to note that the rather apocalyptic weather of late 
was easily understood in the light of the prophetic dream of one of our 
friends: the world was ending in this dream, and it was July 17, 1993.  We 
chatted idly about the obvious fact that we had merely 2 weeks of this life 
left, and eventually, 9:00 rolled around.
 
    It didn't take long to rip all of our coffee filters, lose a good deal 
of filtrate, and feel hopeless.  Luckily, we found that a handkerchief made 
a much more effective filter in this case, and we obtained a large amount 
of liquid, keeping the bulk of the solid matter in the cloth.  We cleaned 
up the kitchen, proposed a toast to permanent psychoses, clicked glasses, 
and stared at our potion.  Jarquom wittily began to chant "Chug.. Chug.. 
Chug!", and Zworfin and I naively obliged.  This was most likely the worst 
decision of the night, and the taste made me lightheaded enough that I 
wouldn't have been disappointed if the LSA didn't take.  We quickly 
attacked the pitcher of juice in the refrigerator, and within minutes, our 
suffering was over.  Prulict and Jarquom had popped "White Men Can't Jump" 
into the VCR, so I sat down to watch it while Zworfin grabbed his book and 
CD player.
 
    I'd estimate that it was very roughly 10:30 when Zworfin was starting 
to smile at nod knowingly, and I was groaning and clutching my rather 
displeased stomach.  I was rather certain that I would not enjoy my journey 
if I embarked upon it with this sort of physical sensation.  I considered 
the tried-and-true method of purging one's digestive system in order to 
smooth out the trip, but I couldn't bring myself to do that.  In order to 
make it to church on time, Jarquom left at the end of the movie (probably 
around 11:00), driven by Prulict.  I was a little disturbed by Prulict's 
absence, as she was to be our anchor-to-reality, guide, and babysitter, but 
she would return soon, of course.  While she was gone, my trip turned 
around completely.  It seems that the basic turning point was the partaking 
of a Mr. Freeze-style popsicle at the behest of Zworfin.  I was beginning 
to feel the amplification of all physical touch, and my mind was softly 
humming with the giddy onset of free association.  Zworfin was overjoyed, 
as he was definitely eager to have a companion for his trip.  Prulict 
returned, and after taking care of some minor things around the apartment 
(laundry and such), she sat down with us, and joined us.
 
    She truly did join us, too.  All three of us agreed that it almost 
seemed as if she had imbibed a decent share of LSA, also.  Of course, she 
still had a firm grip on reality, but she was willing to "play along" with 
our silliness, and she enveloped herself completely in the emotional 
outpouring that Zworfin and I had for her.  There had been a few too many 
problems in our relationship (1 relationship for the three of us, because 
that's basically the way we live it), and we couldn't have hoped for a more 
thorough reconciliation.  Zworfin and I quickly understood what had been 
separating us, and we were able to finish each other's sentences to an 
unreasonable extent, as if we both had a full script in front of us.  After 
we felt our problems solved, we turned to Prulict.  We realized suddenly 
how important she was to our experience, our lives, and our relationship - 
and she was the main object of our thoughts for most, if not all, of the 
trip.
 
    Although I'm still not sure ultimately how the entire experience 
affected Zworfin and Prulict's relationship, I was presented with a 
remarkable understanding of how the entire ordeal would eventually turn out 
favorably. Prulict will be leaving soon to spend some time on her own, 
sorting things out, but I have never felt closer to anyone than I felt to 
the two of them that night - and I now am well aware that that bond will 
always, in some way, hold us all together.  I was in constant awe at the 
beauty surrounding me - Zworfin, who had helped me through the most 
difficult times in my life thusfar; Prulict, who had entered into my life 
rather recently, but to whom I already felt a love as strong as any I've 
ever known; and the relationship between all three of us, which was 
manifesting as a pure ever-strengthening glow of closeness.  Many important 
realizations and analogies about life and reality were developed that 
night, but none seemed as important as the understanding and sharing that 
went on between us.
 
    The profound glowing ecstasy of it all is beyond description.  I felt 
at many times as if I would cry from the sheer beauty of it all - even when 
Zworfin was expressing his tearing emotions of loss at Prulict's planned 
departure, my tears were not of sadness, but of love and joy for the 
wondrous light I saw in both of them.  I could tell, then, in everything 
that any of us did - I saw myself in them, and each of them in the other 
and myself.  We spent much time snuggling and idly holding hands/stroking 
arms in various combinations, and the pure energy that was transmitted to 
me caused me to wonder if my body could handle such warm, all-encompassing 
sensations.  I also have never seen such beauty as I found in Prulict's 
reactions to the experience.
 
    Eventually, Prulict grew tired, and Zworfin and I were able to continue 
our discussions between each other, basking in the seemingly error-free 
connection between our thoughts.  We could discuss a model for reality, and 
it would instantly appear in the other's mind.  The most useful and 
applicable of these was a fractal model for relationships, thoughts, and 
experiences.  A thought or an experience is an infinite spiral, consisting 
of innumerable other spirals, and placed as a component of other, larger 
spirals.  Thus, a thought could be pursued into itself, gaining detail as 
the spirals of which it is composed are made up.  Or, one can pursue the 
thought as it relates to other thoughts - where it fits in the larger 
spirals.  When we gave an analogy to the other, it was an empty spiral, and 
it only made sense when we realized how to fit our existing thoughts into 
it.  A few clues, the thoughts that we had already understood to fit into 
the analogy, would help to get the point across.  An analogy for this (not 
to get carried away.. :): If I give you a bunch of stones and say "Arrange 
them in the right order", you're sort of at a loss.  But, if I say, 
"Arrange them into a circle with a line through the center", you can make 
an image that looks very nearly like mine.  The line could be oriented 
incorrectly, but one of us has only to walk a short distance around the 
circle to remedy that.
 
    We continued on until 4 or 5 in the morning, when I took 150mg of 
Valerian Extract, in an attempt to cushion the ride back down and get some 
sleep.  It worked beautifully.  I felt myself tying up loose ends, and 
coming back to reality, a sensation I find perhaps more intriguing than 
much of the trip, but it was very smooth.  I closed my eyes, and saw 
beautiful images that reminded me of computer graphics (in fact, I'm in the 
process of ray tracing and animating one of them).  Zworfin saw similar 
images.  We knew that this would be a major stepping stone in many of the 
relationships we've been strongly working to lift to the level that ours 
has reached.  Indeed, discussing this with a few other friends the day 
after proved to patch many gaps in our understanding of each other.  
 
    It is for this that I advocate the usage of substances such as LSA.  We 
made an effort to use it efficiently, effectively, responsibly, and safely, 
and 2 days later, the only effects that remain with me are the newfound 
love among my friends.  Learning to use powerful tools has its rewards, and 
the human mind is my favorite of all the tools I've yet to encounter.  I 
expect I'll be writing a huge text on the things we learned, in the hopes 
that a few more people will understand them.  I can't hope to include the 
majority of even the highlights, because it was all so important, but this 
should at least serve to reaffirm the sense that these substances have the 
potential to create and further beautiful things - in ways I could no 
longer deny.

        Could anyone recommend a safe but effective dosage of morning glory
seeds?  I have munched on seeds on a few occasions, once with visual effects,
but I hear they are poisonous.  This one place I bought seeds from told me they
weren't responsible for me poisoning myself to death or into a coma when I
bought four packages.  Is there any truth to this at all?  The most I have ever
eaten at a time was three and one-half packages, about a hundred seeds.  I felt
quite nauseous and my stomach ached for an hour but this went away.  
Then my body felt sore and a little weak, up until a day later.  
I went home and I saw an alien superimposed on the Rush
Limbaugh show (not that I regularly watch that) and fractals on my ceiling
later that night.  Of course, the experience was probably enhanced by MJ and
this homemade passion-flower concentrate (a little harmine).  I want to eat
seeds again but I'd like to know the consequences first.  Also, rumors say the 
alkaloid in the seeds closely resembles LSD25 and the visuals were very
LSD-like.  Any truth in that?

Well after all of the recent talk about Morning Glory, I tried it
for the first time.  In fact this is really, my first experience
with psychedelics, other than grass.

Very Strange.  First off, I decided that an appropriate dose
would be about 100 seeds.  I guess that this would correspond to
approximately 100ug LSA.  I took the seeds and ground them very
fine with my coffee grinder.  I remembered that some posts
mentioned that nausea, is a common side effect, so I decided to use
an enema.  Big mistake.  I mixed the ground powder with water,
and poured the solution into the bag.  Something in the seeds 
swelled up unbelievably, clogging the tube.  What a mess.  
Eventually, I got most of the liquid inside of me, and I will
omit the gory details.

Within maybe, five minutes, the tiles in the bathroom began to
swim, almost as though my vision didn't like the hard edged lines
of the grout.  Circular objects didn't present as much of a
problem, only anything with a corner.  I decided to have a warm
bath.  I drew the bath and soaked for maybe fifteen minutes.

When I closed my eyes, I found that I was perfectly calm and
centered, as if nothing was going on.  Then I'd open them up,
and everything would look O.K. for a couple of seconds, and then
would start to swim. Closing my eyes, would bring me back
together again.  I lost sense of time, though, and I started to
feel very tired.  I don't know if it was the MG or the bath, that
was making me feel that way.

I lay down on the couch, and sleep rapidly came over me.  It was
almost as if I couldn't keep my eyes open.  I don't remember much
after this, except for a small part of the dream which I had.

Towards the end, when I was getting up or preparing to wake up, I
was in some type of garden.  It was somewhat tropical, but it
didn't quite feel natural.  Almost as though it was cultivated.
All of the normal elements, which I associate with nature were
absent.  There were no sounds, no feeling of sunlight, no winds.
And yet this garden was very dense with plants.  It wasn't even
as though I was in the garden, I was watching myself in the
garden.  (It's strange, as I try to write about this, it becomes
hazy.)  Because, I WAS in the garden?!?!

All in all, a very strange experience, although I only remember a
few minutes at the start, and those split seconds before I woke
from the dream.  The hours in between are gone.  Definitely,
interesting, though.  I felt strange for the rest of the day, and
since then have had a couple of days, where I just felt "right".  

Now for the questions,  How can I eliminate whatever material
swells up?  I've got some of the information on extraction, but
chemistry is not my field.  Is Robonsol lighter fluid a
substitute for ether?  I'm not sure if Robonsol is like Zippo or
not.  (And I'll be damned, if I can figure out what "ether" is.)
or anything about solvents.  (If I can't even do a MG extraction,
what on earth am I going to do with canary seed.)

Second, is the extraction into ethanol, only to deal with nausea?
I guess that an enema eliminates this or am I wrong.

Then as far as the experience itself goes:

Does MG, have a sedating effect.  This stuff knocked mye out.

Second, what is this entity that's spoken of.  Somehow, I could
say that there was a definite presence there with me, but I
couldn't identify it.  Although it did seem that we were
communing.

Well, I finally did the morning glory trip.  The first time I tried it, I 
ended up falling asleep, and didn't get the whole expereince.  But it 
left me feeling alive and happy for days afterwards.  Now there's any 
emptiness in my soul.  But it's not an emptyness, from using the potion.  
No, quite the opposite.  It's an emptiness, because of what it is that 
isn't here right now.  (Semantics of dubious distinction.)

Let me just say, that I have never had an experience like this.  Sure, 
I've smoked a couple of joints, and tried one or two substances, but this 
is beyond all description.  I took 500 Heavenly blue seeds, ground them 
up into a fine powder; and did a bit of an extraction.  I dried the seed 
powder, mixed it in a glass with a Jolt and a shot of Vodka.  And tried 
to down as much of it as I could.  This stuff is awful tasting.  

I drank the potion at 10:00 last night.  What a night I've had.  it's 
beyond words.  I've practiced yoga for many years now, and I think it 
really helped me for this experience. By 11:00, I felt strange, but in an 
unquantifiable way.  I'm posting from Canada, and we had our big birthday 
celebration here yesterday, so I wanted to go out and enjoy myself.  I 
tried to have a bath, but I had forgotten how to.  Or more precisely, I 
just wasn't washing parts of my body by rote.  I had to think, of what I 
was doing.  At 12:00, I finally made it out the door.

And then the adventure began...

What an adventure.  Bars are an absolutely fascinating place.  Who needs 
a rave.  It isn't a time or a space, it's a frame of reference.  This was 
indescribable.  I finally understood, Warhol's, statement about everyone's 
15 minutes.  And I understood about everyone's game.  It's amazing how 
all of the pretence, all of the falsehood melts away.  And it's great how 
you can take someone's energy and build it, or take it and leave it 
behind.  A feeling of sadness can just flood you, and then in a moment 
it's gone, because you realize it's just a feeling, but ecstasy is 
different.  THAT stays.  Call it a real world, where all of the nonsense 
just disappears.  

On the dance floor, the energy was fantastic.  The crowd was all up and 
together because of the Canada day celebration.  And the music and the 
sounds and the lights.  (This is all beyond words.)  But I heard the 
sounds of the natives, a chant, but it wasn't;  more like a click sound, 
the sound of everyone who has taken it before.  (This is all beyond 
words.)  But I bought, things, and then just left them.  It's amazing, 
that you can just go and give someone money, and then they'll give you 
something.  THIS WAS A REVELATION.  Dancing to a remix of the Village 
People's YMCA, and doing the bump and grind, and chattanooga with 
everyone on the dance floor.  Stripping off my shirt, and having people 
read my T-Shirt, and having them just get a great smile over their 
face.   "Life's Short, stay hard," it said.  People would read it, and 
then look up at me, (I'm very tall), and then they would just get this 
beautiful smile.  Having people dance, is incredible.  Especially 
natives. It's just beyond words.

I got tired after a while, and went and bought some chicken wings.  Not 
to actually eat, mind you.  (That would have made me ill.)  But just the 
actual experience.  But I did ask the bartender for a couple pieces of 
lime.  The fruit was far more nourishing than anything else.  And from 
there the experience began.

I'll leave out the part about going to the other bar, and seeing more 
games of a different type.  And of the two people who were screwing in 
their motor home, parked outside of a funeral parlour which was just 
being built, and of the Masonic temple, with the two dead tree stumps 
guarding the front entrance.  And get to the garden.  The garden in the 
middle of the city.  I realized that the key to a garden are the spirits 
who live there.  And how important it is to make a place for them.  I 
stayed in the garden till dawn, feeling the soft earth, give under my 
every step, the magnetic draw of fallow ground, the dancing of water over 
the rocks, and the waterfalls.  This garden is in the middle of the city, 
with soaring skyscrapers all around.  This little piece of paradise in 
the middle of the city.

The only thing I can say is wow.  Total amazement.  I know this all 
sounds very disjointed, but it's beyond all words.  

This post is getting far too long.  There is so much to say, And yet 
words can't possibly do it any justice.  If there is any such thing as a 
cathartic experience, this is it.  It's been enough for me to think of 
reevaluating my entire life.  

Do I recommend it to anyone?  Well, yes, and no.  I think if the time and 
the mood is right, it will happen.  There's no need to go searching for 
it somewhere else, because happiness, and bliss isn't anywhere else.  
It's all right here, right under our noses, if we would only stop the 
nonsense, and listen.  "Stop Making Sense", indeed, "True Stories" from 
the twilight zone.  And a foro.
