   For this, you need the Peyote cactus, which is hard to come by, but if you
do get a hold of the cactus, this will be useful.

1) Take fresh peyote buttons, wash, remove all tufts and foreign particles.

2) Take the peyote meat and grind it in a meat or coffee grinder.

3) Allow ground peyote meat to dry, then grind as before.

4) Boil peyote meat for five hours, keeping plenty of water in the pot to 
   prevent burning.

5) Take skin and bark of peyote and break down by beating on a cutting board.
   When it is broken down, boil for five hours in a seperate pot.

6) Strain liquids from both pots and combine. Throw away the peyote mush.

7) Boil this solution until it becomes dark. Do not allow it to become to
   thick. Label it solution "A".

8) Now cool solution "A".

9) Take the cool solution "A" and fill half a separatory funnel.

10) Add about an equal volume of ethyl ether, and shake for two minutes.

11) Now allow the liquids to settle and form layers. Draw off the water
    solution (bottom layer) by turning the stop cork. Do not draw off the
    ether solution.

12) Now process all of solution "A" in this manner. Label all drawn-off
    solution "B". Put the leftover ether solution into a container and
    throw away.

13) Boil down solution "B" to cut down volume, but do not allow it to
    become too thick.

14) Add a phenophthalein indicator to solution "B", until the solution
    turns red.

15) Mix in small amounts of a diluted sulfric acid solution, until the red
    color disappears. Do not add more acid than required.

16) Add one teaspoon of baking powder (to neutralize the acid) for each 
    gallon of solution. Boil again to reduce volume.

17) Place solution "B" in the refrigerator for several hours, but do not frezze
    it.

18) While it is still cold, pour off as much of the liquid as possible, 
    leaving the crystal in the container. Rinse the crystals with near-
    frezzing water.

19) Add rinse water with water poured off crystals. Boil this solution to
    reduce volume and then cool in the refrigerator. Repeat procedure for
    formation of the crystals. These crystals are nearly pure mescaline
    sulphate. Allow crystals to dry and then capsule.

This usually makes between 30-80 mg. per button.
