I've seen a lot of posts recently telling the good, the bad, and the ugly about
DM (as in Robitussin, yum yum...)  I'm no expert at drugs, I will attest.  I
rarely drink, and have smoked MJ even more infrequently (like, oh, 5 times
total in my life...)  I have been around people who have done drugs.  Usually I
was the "designated straightedge."  I enjoyed the job, but now have began to
"fiddle" around a little bit (oh the joys of College life :)  Anyhow, I have
been messing around with DM recently, and thought I'd share my personal
experiences with it:

1st Time:  Drank a 4oz bottle of Robitussin DM.  Loved it, since my roomie is
deathly afraid of the stuff.  He used to do it, and now can't even get near a
bottle of the stuff without heaving.  Drank the whole 4ozs in front of him in
about 2 minutes, and made sure to breathe the fumes on him :)  Not a whole lot
of effect, but I did not really expect much.  Some dizziness, a little bit of
audio hallucinations (music was a whole lot more interesting...)  I was more
talkative, but always felt like I was slurring my speech (even though,
according to my friends, I was not.)  Time seemed to move really slow.  The
high lasted about 4 hours, even though it felt longer.  Felt tired, worn out
afterwards and slept rather well...

2nd Time:  Drank another 4oz of Rob-DM.  Licked my lips as my roomie gagged at
the sight of me drinking it (unlike others, I do not mind the taste of
Robitussin too awful much, although I do have to drink plenty to get the
lingering taste out of my mouth...)  Much the same effects as before, but even
more pronounced.  No real visual-hallucinations at all.  Lasted a bit longer
this time, maybe 5 hours.  Loads of fun walking around.  Next to impossible to
urinate, though  :)

3rd Time:  Decided to be cheap, and bought a bottle of generic Hy-Vee Brand
"Tussin."  Ingredient label was EXACTLY the same as Robitussin DM (I made sure
to check.)  Got back, drank it all in 3 mighty gulps.  Taste was AWFUL!  I
could feel my guts beginning to churn.  I sat back, waiting a bit for the
effects to take hold (usually takes about 45 minutes when I drink a whole
bottle at one time..)  A friend came in and told me they were dragging someone
up on the memorial arch at school (a big 50 foot monument to something), so I
rushed out there.  I helped drag him up by pulling a rope that was slung over
the top, and had to do a lot of strenuous pulling.  I got violently sick, and
threw up in the snow by the arch.  After about an hour and a half outside, I
still felt no effect.  Went back in and went to sleep.  Absolutly no effects. 
Felt cheated.

4th Time:  Another 4oz Robitussin.  Even more effects than before.  Began to
get into the "oh WOW!" type syndrome.  Everything became INFINATELY more
interesting.  I'd tend to stare off into space without blinking for moments at
a time.  Began having minor hallucinations, too.  Posters and things on the
wall would seem to jump and change places just a little bit.  Slight visuals
too, like a flashing off-color light field in front of my eyes for moments at
a time.  Lasted even longer, about 6 hours, and time felt really, really
distorted.  I awoke the next morning full of energy, too.

5th Time:  BIG TIME.  Decided to go all out, and bought the 8oz Family Size
Robitussin DM.  Drank it all within 10 minutes (to the absolute DISGUST of
everyone in the room.)  Kind of a mistake, but not really.  It began like
normal, dizziness, then audio-hallucinations, then slight visuals.  But it
continued on.  I began to have more massive visuals.  Big colored blobs flowing
and oozing in front of my eyes.  Staring at any one spot for awhile caused that
spot to seem to fly away, almost like I was shrinking.  My friends left me
alone for awhile, and I sat in the room in the dark.  More hallucinations,
including one full-blown, "I do not exist, anymore"-type hallucination.  I
thought I was a flower.  I could feel myself swaying the wind, I could see a
big field of grass instead of my normal surroundings.  This went away rather
quickly, and has been the only real, full-out hallucination I have had yet. 
I was full of energy, too.  I was hyper.  I was bouncing off the walls in our
hallway, running around, talkative.  When I finally sat down, about 6 hours
later, I was still buzzing.  I began to get tired, and started sort of passing
out.  During that time, I began convulsing.  I'd all of a sudden get sort of a
seizure, and flail around in the chair I was sitting in.  That lasted about 45
minutes, until I fell fully asleep.  Awoke nice and refreshed the next day.

6th Time:  I was kind of hesitant to do any more after the last experience, but
I eventually downed another 4ozer (of Rob-DM).  Not a whole lot, just a normal
4oz trip.  I might have been holding myself back because of the experience I
had with the 8ozer.

7th Time:  Another 8oz Family Rob-DM.  Great time.  I had all the effects I had
before on the 8oz, but no adverse side-effects.  I was loaded with energy.  The
trip lasted at least 10 hours, and I was buzzing the whole time.  Finally fell
asleep, and woke up the next morning feeling good, but a little bit messed up
still.  This was probably the longest trip I have ever had on Robitussin yet.

8th (and most recent) Time:  Decided to make a change, and picked up the
Maximum Strength Robitussin 4oz.  Drank it all in the normal 3 big gulps.  Wow. 
I wasn't filled with as much energy as before: I couldn't bounce around as much
and stuff.  But the buzz, and the visuals, and everything was just the same as
drinking 8oz.  I had some wild visual hallucinations.  For awhile, it felt like
I was walking around only in 2-dimensions.  Everything had length and height,
but no width.  Wild...  The next day I was violently ill, though.  I think this
had more to do, though, with the fact that I was coming down with a cold all
weekend, and not the Robitussin.

Will I do it again?  Probably.  I have heard a lot about the similarity between
DM-trips and LSD & Shroom-trips.  I would consider trying them(LSD, Shrooms), 
but they are near to impossible to come by in Ass Backwards, IA where I am 
attending College.  So you can bet I might be making a few more trips to the
local supermarket for that (ahem) bad cold I got.  I don't really condone the
stuff.  It may sound great, but there are plenty of bad effects.  If you have a
weak stomach, or can't handle the smell of Robitussin, then for god sakes
DON'T.  You'll puke.  Only reason I can handle the stuff is because I kind of
like the taste (strange, I know, but I still complain to my roomie that it
tastes better than the Millwaukee's Best Light beer he loves to drink...)  If
you are depressed, or have an adversion to drugs, then for christ sakes, DON'T! 
If you have to drive, or work, or anything strenuous, then for satan's sake,
DON'T!  I had to drive a few friends to the bar about 20 minutes after drinking
a bottle, and I will NEVER do that again.  I had my roomie (who had not been
drinking, thank god) take over for me.

=============================================================================

The Place:
        Philadelphia, Pa. USA 3/13/93. Alone in my apartment.

The Person:
        28 years old. 240 pounds. Nothing better to do.

The Conditions:
        MAJOR east coast winter storm. 1 foot plus of snow.
        howling winds(75mph+). sleet. thunder and lightning!
        PA state of emergency. ALL area interstates and airports
        closed.

The Dosage:
        Total of 14oz. 4oz Robo Max Cough and 2oz Generic DM at 3pm.
        8oz Robo DM over next 3-4 hours.

The Synergists:
        Pot Only. NO Alcohol. NO Caffiene.
        Food before, during, and after ingestion.
        Heavily Stoned at start of ingestion.

Effects:
        Starts real mellow. A body warming. Slightly drunk and dizzy. In a
        very good way. A "boozey" drunken feeling it is not, maybe like Seconal.
        A definite "in the body" thing. Started cutting corners close, bumping
        into walls. Destortions in my spatial perception. Sight slighly blurry,
        Impossible for me to read small print. Underlying calmness.

        Music is much more enjoyable. A kind of craving for louder and harder
        beats. Enjoying the textures of the tape hiss between tracks.

        Strange disjointed thought process. Underlying calmness.

        Full warping of subspace. Pin Head with expansize arms/legs. Incredible
        head size. Warping and folding of body. Incredible spatial distortions.

        Had to lie down on bed with no light. Wind was howling but i was calm.
        Continued spatial and mental distortions, but with a calmness telling
        me the trip was going to be okay. Never "totally" lost it like with LSD.

        Underlying calmness throughout entire trip which is unlike LSD for me.
        LSD tends to be a "speedy", tense kind of trip for me. Hard for me
        to ride an LSD trip because of the tenseness.

Precautions:
        I got the stuff down real easy. A little iced tea chaser and i'm
        fine. YOU may find Robo SICKENING getting and keeping down.
        If you can get yourself in the mindset needed to guzzle and keep
        down several oz of hard liquor, you'll do fine with Robo.

        PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT TO DRIVE DURING THIS TYPE OF BUZZ.

The Verdict:
        WOW. This involves some further research. Will do Robo Max Cough
        (seems to be the strongest/purest form i can get) with some friends
        next week. Will check my results without the initial POT buzz.

I agree...a couple of weeks ago (actually, it was that Friday night when
we had the big blizzard here on the east coast), I consumed 8-9 shots of
40 proof rum, which did not significantly intoxicate me, but definitely
buzzed me somewhat. About an hour and a half later I drank 4 oz. of
Robitussin DM (the kind with guanefenesin (sp) and DM). Anyway, very
soon I noticed the difficulty focusing my eyes, and in about an hour,
experienced nausea the likes of which I never hope to ever have again. I
also broke out in an intense cold sweat (anybody else ever notice this).
I don't know if these effects should be attributed to the alcohol/cough
medicine combination, or just the fact that it was DM _and_ guanefenesin
I had drunk, or what. Anyway, I didn't vomit, but I would have if I had
moved the slightest from the sitting position I was in. The nausea
passed within 5 minutes or so though, and the rest of the ~6 hour trip
was mostly pleasant, with great enhancement of music perception [do ya
think the guys in Phish ever did any drugs? nah :-)] and mild visuals
such as trails.
    I definitely wouldn't recommend mixing alcohol and DM though, based
on my experience.

=============================================================================

Well, after all the messages about this stuff I decided to try it
myself.  Because I didn't want to get carried away I decided to try 2 oz
and see what that did first.  Well my first, and only, time trying that
stuff was horrible.  I ended up throwing up about 3 times on Saturday
night.  I also became very hyper and several times had problems
breathing.  Guess my system just doesn't like the stuff ay guys?  Other
symptoms included getting a fever and dizziness.  This experience really
scared the hell out of me.  I think I'll just stick with the old methods
from now on.  I'm just glad I didn't take the whole damned bottle.  I'm
sure that would've been REALLY fun.......

        Well all of this talk about Robotussen DM made me kind of
curious...so I decided to try it for myself. I ran over to the drug
store and bought an 8 oz bottle of regular strenght robotussen dm. 
Its about 85 degrees here so i didnt even try to pretend I had a cold. I
did however mention to the cashier that due to budget problems Summer
may have to be cancled this year. She gave me a puzzled look and
appeared to become nervous (she must have had some summer plans:)), but
she happily sold me the cough medicine. 
        I went home, flipped on the TV and in one gulp drank half the
bottle. The after taste had me on my knees but I managed not to puke. I
waited about 45 mins, and nothing. After about an hour I began to feel
kind of loopy but it didnt seem like anything major, so I promptly
quaffed the rest of the bottle. Strangely enough it tasted kind of good
this time. About 15 mins later i began to feel kind of drunk, I had no
coordination whatsoever. And then about 15 minbs after that WHAM! I was
delerious. I felt like I was sinking into the couch. It was as if
gravity had doubled or tripled. I could not focus at all, and seemed to
see everything in two dimensions. I didnt ever really lose it though,
and with a lot of work I could almost control the effects. Millions of
thoughts began to race through my mind. After about 6 hours I began to
wonder if id ever come down. I had paranoid thoughts of never coming
down. Somehow I managed to figure out how to use the phone, and begged
one of my friends to bring me some anti-nasua medication. Well that did
the trick after about 1/16 oz I was happay again, and promtly passed
out. 
        The next morning I didnt feel bad, but I was kind of light
headed. This dizzyness stayed with me for a couple of days but
eventually wore off.
        The whole experiance was interesting...        
        Was it worth it?...Probably not. It is NOT like any mushrooms
I've ever had. So I would recomend sticking with the safer, more
enjoyable options discussed in this news group, rather than pounding a
bottle of cough syrup.

    I am very tired, as I have had a long night of insomnia, but my 
sleeplessness was caused by reasons that I need to start to alleviate now.  I 
am seeking, first and foremost, any and all information anyone may have on a 
Dextromethorphan Hybrobromide "psychosis".  There is a long story to this, but 
I will do my best to summarize.

    Last night, while I was tripping, 2 of my 3 companions for the evening 
decided they'd get in on the excitement a bit with some handy Robitussin.  The 
third was a) not interested, and b) the requisite babysitter/driver.  Anyway, 
At some time in the chronological blur of last night, the Tussin user at whose 
we were decided that he wanted to try to astrally project.  After this, he 
started acting strangely, and in a very disturbing manner.

    It took awhile for my effects to wear off to the level at which I could be 
certain that it was he and not I who was behaving strangely, but this 
morning's happenings have ultimately confirmed that.  It was ten hours ago 
(from now, 8:30 AM) that he capped off his cough syrup, and since he tried to 
project, he's been speaking in a very monotone, broken speech.  Very precise 
and inarticulate. He sounds like a robot, and very noticeably.  He cannot 
think straight or focus on objects that are far away, says he "doesn't know" 
when asked how he is, and cannot specify where his limbs are unless he looks 
directly at them.

    This matches nothing I have experienced, nor anything that anyone I have 
read of has experienced, with the exception of an individual that mentioned a 
friend with a "manic" response to DM and LSD that has required hospitalization 
for up to a week.  My friend, however, has used LSD a handful of times with no 
undesirable effects during or after the trips.  Indeed, he tends to love the 
stuff.  This experience, too, was thrilling, and he found it very amusing 
until his speech was decaying.  Well, to be fair, he found the speech amusing 
for a couple hours, and recorded himself before getting bored/disturbed with 
it.

    Also, I was amazed that he wasn't tired.  DM _should_, in my 
understanding, produce a sedating effect.  He couldn't fall asleep, though, 
and didn't know whether or not he wanted to.  He eventually did, with the help 
of the Valerian root that is kept around to cushion the "ride back down".  The 
only problem is that he awoke in seemingly the same state.  Through the entire 
drive to get me home, he seemed very disturbed, crossing his eyebrows and 
looking around alot, sitting in a contorted position.  The other person in the 
car, [Driver's name here], asked if I was used to it lasting this long.  I 
wasn't, and I reminded them that even if I was, I wasn't used to any of the 
other properties of his experience.  The only thing any of us could think of 
was getting me home without causing alarm, and probing for information, 
specifically on the 'net.

    More importantly than the science behind my friend's experience, I need to 
know what I do now.  Can we call the doctor with a case of intentional 
overdose of dextromethorphan?  Are there certain lines we should/shouldn't 
call?

    What do we do, now?  I beg your help, as my friend would, if he could get 
a firm enough grip on reality to decide whether or not he was alright.

    I'm somewhat frightened, honestly, and I do not find an uninformed, 
frightened state to be acceptable for the situation, in which SOME action 
seems necessary, and perhaps with relative haste.

    All help will be taken into account (and rest assured that this is not a 
cheap reference to "friend" as a convenient entity to take my blame, this is 
truly a good friend of mine, not me.)

At one point last year, I was drinking about a 24 fl oz/week of robitussin
in its two most palatable forms; Robitussin DM, and Robitussin Maximum
strength Cough.  The latter, in my opinion is a better deal as I think its
cost/vol is comparable to DM, but you only need 2/3 as much to get the same
amout of DMHBr. 

It has slipped my mind how much of the DMHBr is actually in the normal eight
oz dose of DM or the 5.33oz dose of max. strength, but it was sufficient for
a good12-18 hour trip.  It should be noted, that if you plan to ingest
heroic amounts of DMHBr, you must plan to be really out of it for at least
30 hours.  After the initial trip, you will have a feeling of falling a
definite + to ++ on the Shulgin scale for at least another 12 hours.  Also
I've never noticed any tolerance built for DMHBr.  If there was a tolerance,
I think it would have become apparent.  It's a good trip, but can, as with
any psychoactive compound, cause panic attacks as I have experienced at
least twice.  As with all drugs, set and setting cannot be ignored with
DMHBr.  A DMHBr powder was mentioned.  Where is it available, not who can I
get it from, but what part of the country  have you seen it in.  I read of s
uch a powder in Mondo 200, but to my chagrin   I've seen none.  Does anyone
know how to extract DMHBr from the syrup, as kidneydamage can insue from
longterm ingestion of the syrup.  That's why I stopped.

A FOAF of mine tried Tussian.  8 oz. of extra strength at 15 mg DXM per 5
mL and 1.4% alcohol.  No other active drug ingredients.  700-750 mg total.
 
It hit pretty fast (within a half an hour) with light headedness and
slight disorientation.  After an hour there was SEVERE disorientation and
depersonalization.  He felt almost as if he were outside himself looking
in.  There weren't especially harsh visual effects as in real
hallucinations.  Things were very grainy and somewhat distorted.  Unable
to keep focus on much of anything.  He got severe itching fits several
times (the only way around it was to ignore the itching, stop and wait til
you forget about it).  Breathing often felt slightly constricted as if you
were wearing a tight shirt collar.  There were severe heat flashes so
that we had to turn a fan on high in an air conditioned house.  Walking
was very difficult.  Hard to keep a balance.  Time was VERY distorted. 
The whole trip lasted about an 1.5-2 hrs for the strong effects but it
seemed like FOREVER.  He was also very dehydrated and found it hard to get
the damn cherry taste out of his mouth.  Also, this person has taken many
trips on acid and several shroom trips and has never had anything as scary
as this experience.  Several times he wondered if he would make it through
it alive.  Probably due to the fact that it was an unknown experience.  4
hrs after taking the tussin he was driven home from teh friends' place he
was at.  He through up twice between the stairs and the door to his room. 
Apparently the car ride had disturbed his stomache.  Luckily almost all he
had in his stomach was liquid from drinking.  Coming down took a while.  
Effects were very similar to coming down off of acid.  Unable to sleep,
small muscle jitters.  All in all something he would never do again and
which is really going to turn him off of drugs for a while, if not forever.

Ick.  Recmmendation:  If you want to try tussin, don't do too large of an
amount.  Stick to the lower amounts for the buzzing effect.  Similar to
being drunk.  This is NOT just like taking acid :)  This was worse of a
trip than my friend ever had on acid or shrooms.

=============================================================================

the following is an experience related by a FOAF. i am posting this for 
him as a favor, but not on my own account (i don't have access to the 
annon service). in other words, the person who's name is associated with 
this post is completely innocent (and foolish for leaving their terminal 
logged in). also, i don't know him/her, and he/she doesn't know me, so 
don't bother asking. here it is: . . .

I always wanted to know what an acid trip was like, and I heard 
that you can get the same effects with DM cough syrup, so I 
went to the drug store and picked up a 4 oz (120 mL) bottle of 
extra strength DM "tussin" cough syrup.  It was an in-store 
brand comparable to extra strength Robitussin.  The specs on 
the bottle said: 
Ingredients per teaspoonful (5 mL)
   Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide, USP 15 mg 
   in syrup with Alcohol 1.4%.
These were the only ingredients.  

The first time, I was a little nervous, so I only took 120 mg 
of DM (40 mL or 8 teaspoons or 1/3 of the bottle).  Within an 
hour or two, I started feeling a mild buzz.  I was talkative 
and I seemed to notice colors and lights a little more than 
usual.  These mild effects lasted about 5 hours before I felt 
like it was totally worn off.  

The next day, I got a little bolder.  I downed the remaining 
portion of the bottle.  This amounted to 240 mg (80 mL or 16 
teaspoons or 2/3 of the bottle).  I ate some food both times, 
so this may have delayed the start of the effects.  Perhaps 
there was a little bit left in my system from the day before.  

I was sitting down, doing some reading, and nothing happened 
for well over an hour or maybe two hours.  Then, all of the 
sudden, I got a severe heat flash.  It felt like a sick wave 
flowing over my entire body.  I could even feel a strong 
buzzing (almost like pain) in the roots of my teeth.  Every 
inch of skin on my body felt like it was next to a hot water 
bottle.  I was very light headed and thought I was going to 
die.  I quickly scribbled information on a piece of paper to 
tell anyone that found me what I had taken.  The heat flash 
went away after what seemed like 5 or 10 minutes.  Actually it 
was probably only a minute or two.  I felt my forehead and it 
was dripping with sweat.

I was ok for a while after that.  I talked with a friend for 
about 10 or 15 minutes, but it seemed like hours.  Again, I was 
very talkative.  I felt like I was making sense, and having an 
enjoyable time.  I just felt spacy.  There were no visual 
hallucinations, but things did look a bit foggy.

After my friend left I got several more heat flashes.  They 
seemed to be getting closer together.  Each time, I thought I 
was going to die or at least pass out.  Each time it happened, 
I just kept telling myself, "I'm going go get throught this." 
over and over.  VERY unpleasant!  

I walked around a little bit. My head seemed to be bobbing up 
and down like you feel while sitting in a small boat on the 
waves.  Things were a little distorted.  I felt like a midget 
walking down the hall.  I had some difficulty talking 
coherently.  My eyes started to burn, and my mouth became 
excessively dry.  I couldn't concentrate on anything for more 
than a few seconds.  I tried to focus on reality so I wouldn't 
loose control.  I used to use MJ so I was able to keep from 
panicing, but it is still a scary to face the unknown.

As the frequency of the heat flashes increased, I began to 
wonder if the DM was still getting into my system, and making 
things worse.  I had serious doubts about whether or not I 
could get myself home in this condition.  I determined that if 
things got any worse, that I might die, so I picked up a phone 
book and started looking for emergency numbers.  I remember 
being totally frustrated because I knew I wanted to find a 
number to call to get help, but all I could do was flip the 
pages.  I couldn't figure out exactly what to look up.  
Finally, I looked inside the front cover.  911 seemed a little 
drastic.  The only other number was poison control.  After 
several attempts, I finally dialed the number successfully.  
The problem was that I couldn't remember which digit I had just 
dialed or which one to dial next.  I was quite incoherent on 
the phone, and had a lot of difficulty giving my address, phone 
number, etc.  The lady told me that I had taken quite a lot, 
and that I should have someone take me to a hospital.  I asked 
what might happen to me if I didn't go, and she said that I 
possibly could go into a coma and/or stop breathing.  This 
scared me enought that I decided I needed to go in.

I found a friend that was willing to take me in.  Thank 
goodness for friends.  In the Emergency Room, I experienced 
several more heat flashes.  My heart rate was up to almost 120 
beats per minute when I was at my calmest point.  They pumped 
my stomach and put activated charcoal down me to absorb any 
remaining DM.  That is an experience well worth avoiding!  I 
even preferred the blood and urine tests to the gastric lavage. 
My nose and throat were quite sore for several days afterward. 
I started coming down in less that an hour after these 
treatments.  The doctor told me that the dose wasn't fatal, but 
if I hadn't come in, I might have passed out, and probably 
would have continued to experience the symptoms for at least 
another 8 hours.  It would have been a real trick to explain 
that one to my family.  It was hard enough to explain as it 
was.  DM seems to be much more toxic than I had anticipated.

As I came down, my vision cleared up.  I realized that the 
emergency sprinkler system in the ceiling was actually covered 
with dust.  When I first got in there, it looked like it was 
covered with some crystaline jelly; I didn't even know it was a 
mild hallucination at the time.  So, what good is a 
hallucination if you don't know it's a hallucination?  I wonder 
what else I hallucinated.

They let me go within about 4 hours after I was admitted to 
E.R.  At that point, I had a significant head ache, like a 
heavy hangover.  My nose ached deep inside where they had put 
the tube in.  I think it took several more hours for my heart 
rate to go back to normal.  There was also a jittery twitchy 
feeling in the back of my leggs.  I didn't sleep well that 
night.  The hangover feeling lasted for another day.  Three 
days later, I took half of an imipramine (a prescription 
antidepressant left over from a legitimate prescription) 
because my head felt a little foggy.  A few hours later, I got 
a miniature heat flash, and felt a little spacey.  That never 
happened before when I was on these antidepressants.

All in all, I think it was a VERY bad experience!  Sure there 
were a few weird effects, but the negatives far outweighed the 
positives.  The dose I took was significantly lower than what 
some people claim to have taken.  I'm just glad I didn't chug 
the whole bottle at once.  Perhaps some people's bodies can 
handle DM better than mine, but I have also noticed a large 
increase in people telling about bad experiences with it.

I don't think it's a very good idea to take a chance with DM.  
But, if you do, please start with lower doses, let a few days 
pass between doses, and increase the doses gradually.  Not like 
me where I took twice as much as the time before.  As for me, I 
don't think I will ever take DM again!  As for you, try 
something safer, or at least be very carefull!  BTW, I now 
hear that the tussin high is quite a bit different than being 
high on LSD, so I guess I still don't know what acid is like.

I've taken Robitussin a few times (well, at least generic eqivalents with the
same quantity of active ingredients) and frankly, I don't get it.  The first
time all I did was catch a few trails from a cigarette after drinking about
4 oz.  I heard some interesting noises, and procede to get really ill.  I mean,
 I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital because I felt like my
stomach and intestines were on fire.  My friends thought that was strange and
we figured I probably had the flu or something.  So I tried it again, this time
 drinking eith ounces and I felt even worse. The trip was definitely not worth
the intense physical pain I felt for 36 hours afterwards.  I'm not sure if
this is a common thing or not, or if I'm just some freak with a sensitive
stomach.  Thanks, but I'll stick to illicit drugs that make me feel good,
not one's that make me feel like I'm in hell!

Ok, I have done the Tussin Toss quite a number of times in the last nine months
or so.  Other drugs are very hard to come by for an introvert, but alas, the
grocery stores are always open to the young wanting to pollute their minds
with something more interesting and less plain old degrading than alcohol.
Moot point anyway.  I would say that I have done the toss about 15-20 times
at least, and have just started up again after giving my body a 3 month breather

Anyhow, to get to the point, I drank a 4ozer of Robo Max Strength Cold and
Cough the other evening.  (Personal aside:  This is the best deal for the
money, because of it's lack of nasty things like Guaffesin.  Although, some
may not be able to handle the high amounts of Pseudo Ephedrine in it. YMMV)
I remember vaguely back in my mind the constant rumors about how Vitamin C
has an effect on hallucinations and the such.  So I pick up a big bottle of
OJ along with my cold medication (hey, the cashier must've thought I was
really down with a bad cold).  I drank the foul medicine and waited the 45
or so minutes for the effects to kick in.  I had a couple of cigarettes in the
meantime (don't chide me for tobacco use, please), and felt pretty much the 
normal effects.  Well, thinking that I was beginning to hit my normal threshold
, I began drinking some of the orange juice to wash some of the taste out of my
mouth.  Within 20 or so minutes, I had finished about half of the orange juice,
and began feeling, well, different.  Normally, I am used to a euphoric 
feeling when I take tussin, a sort of drunkeness, and a high amount of energy
(probably because of the super-doses of Ephedrine involved).  But this time,
I had all the normal effects, plus much more increased visuals.  Normally, I
do not have much in the way of visuals (on any drug, actually), so it kind of
suprised me.  Things were definately a little haywire.  I had a hard time with
control of my body, too.  I felt much more stoned than ever before.
 
Could this have been just a psychological reaction?  Perhaps my mind was
telling me, hey, your doing OJ with it.  Let's play with him a little bit.
 
Anyhow, just relating a bit of my experience.  I've been reading a lot of the
messages on here about all the people having bad experiences.  I feel sorry
for them, truly, especially if you ended u

up in a hospital.  I have personally had no problems with DM.  Sure, it makes
my stomach mightly upset for the next couple days, and urination becomes a 
bit of a hassle during the actual trip, not to mention the sleep loss.  But
nothing life threatening, at least, not yet.  I warn anyone with a weak stomach,
or some sort of previous bad experience with the stuff to just forget it, you
don't need it that bad if it's going to be nothing but problems.

My girlfriend and I decided to try this.  We also used a store brand,
ingredients same as listed above.  We bought an 8oz bottle and split
it, total DXM per person ~360mg.

We had a good time.  We both thought it was more like being really
drunk without a reason (i.e. we knew we hadn't consumed any alcohol),
than like our (admittedly few) experiences with LSD.  That is to
say that the disorientation and loss of motor control seemed more
like a drunk than an LSD trip, and those were the predominant effects.
I experienced all the same things that the "anonymous poster who
used Jane Ellis' account" listed below:

>  Things were a little distorted.  I felt like a midget 
>walking down the hall.  I had some difficulty talking 
>coherently.  ...and my mouth became 
>excessively dry.  

The midget effect was pretty cool--not like being drunk, I admit.
It only lasted a few seconds, though :-(.

After a couple hours, I started to get hungry.  I couldn't
figure out what I wanted to eat, though, and any specific food item
I thought of made me feel like I was gonna puke.  Even water.
This was sorta bad, because I got dehydrated-feeling, and woke up
the next morning with one of those really splitting behind-the-eyes
you-didn't-drink-any-water-before-going-to-bed hangover-type
headaches.  With tylenol and advil, it took all the next day to get rid
of that headache.

We both had bouts of the itchies.  They passed.  The worst was
when my ears (which, BTW,  were buzzing loudly at that moment)
started to itch way down deep inside.  Ugh.

In my comparison to the 3-4 times I've tried LSD, I have to say
that this was fundamentally different.  When an LSD trip hits me,
I get really excitable.  Jittery.  Heart rate goes up, sweat,
jump around, etc.  When this stuff hit, I felt dopey.  Like there
was a cloud descending over my brain.  I was light headed &
quite dizzy, and certainly didn't feel like jumping around.

All in all, not a bad experience, but not an exceptional one.
My girlfriend also said she liked it, but she had a slight
headache the next day too.

I should also mention that we had just moved the day we tried
this, and we were both exceptionally tired, muscle-achy, etc.
Even still, we didn't have the horrible experiences other people
have reported.

Just wanted to mention that FOAF -- oh, hell, it was _me_, FOAF can take
a hike! -- had a very similar reaction to a mere 150 mg of
dextromethorphan HBr (from Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough).  I took
the DM a few hours after lunch.  One hour later, I had a small snack of
cheese, pretzels and ginger ale, which was probably a bad idea.  I spent
most of the next hour sitting on the couch trying to ignore waves of
nausea.  My Loyal Assistant brought me a large "security bucket", just
in case.

At about the 2 hour mark, I ate an antacid.  This was rather like
pressing the ignition button for the Space Shuttle.  I became very
uncomfortable physically in a way that's hard to describe -- hot,
sweating, panting rapidly, "buzzing" feeling all over.  This was so
intense that it took me about 15 seconds to realize that I was also
about to vomit.  I managed to make it from the couch to the floor, where
my bucket was, and the two of us became good friends for a couple of
minutes.  When I could think again, I realized that my whole body,
especially my hands, had been/were still "buzzing" -- it felt something
like a continuous AC electric shock combined with "pins and needles"
like when your arm goes to sleep.  Loyal Assistant tells me I was
panting rapidly throughout the whole episode, so hyperventilation may
have contributed to the effects.

I don't think this was a "set and setting" problem, as someone
suggested.  My DM dose was rather low, and the psychoactive effects were
comparable in magnitude to what I'd get from a few glasses of wine.  My
guess is that my body pressed the YOU HAVE BEEN POISONED red-alert
button, and took emergency measures to dump my stomach and "save" me.
Afterwards, I felt pretty good, although still a little nauseous.  In
fact, the whole experience was so vivid and memorable that I can almost
say I enjoyed it (although I'm not in a big hurry to try it again!).

It looks like there's a _lot_ of individual variation in reactions to
DM.  I seem to be unusually susceptible to the negative effects,
unfortunately (although I might do better on a completely empty
stomach).  My suggestions from my limited experiences:  treat DM like a
serious drug, experiment with low doses first, and have a sober friend
available to take care of you.

Oh, and DON'T DRIVE for 2 days!  I know someone who had a pleasant DM
experience, felt totally sober and normal the next morning, and
proceeded to try to make a right turn into the left lane of an empty
divided roadway as if driving in England.  I can't prove that this was
an after-effect of the DM, but I think it would be best to err on the
side of caution.

DISCLAIMER:  The following describes one person's experience in taking an
over-the-counter (OTC) cough medicine in excess of the package's maximum
recommended dose.  In no way does this post recommend, suggest, or imply
that you are safe doing the same.  It is meant for informational purposes
only and should not be considered an exhaustive examination of the

you alone, are responsible for your actions and their results. 

    REMEMBER YOU ARE PLAYING WITH YOUR LIFE!  JUST SAY KNOW! 

In an attempt to advance the net.wisdom.cough_syrup I have posted a
friend's account of an experience with dextromethorphan, an OTC cough
suppressant.  Please no flames about his choice of inebriant, suffice to
say the WOsD has made preferred choices difficult to obtain.  
Desperate men -> desperate actions. 

THE PLAYERS:
 One 81 kilogram human male.
 Drixoral(*) Cough Liquid Caps - 10 capsules @ 30 mg each = 300 mg
 Eckerd(*) Tussin Maximum Strength - 2 oz. @ 120 mg each = 240 mg.
  Total dose = 6.6 mg/kg.

THE SETTTING:
 My House (bedroom mostly), daytime

THE SET:
 I took the day off (my birthday) to do this.  In general I'm kinda 
 bummed that I have no way to get to more appropriate (for me) (but
 illegal) substances.  No way, however, that does not risk a total
 collapse of the straight, upstanding reality in which I must live.
 Other than that I'm doing OK.

THE CRONOLOGY:
0730: Cold cereal & coffee breakfast.
0830: Took Drixoral (300 mg.)
0930: No effects, took Tussin (240 mg.)
1000: Diffuclty walking without noticable effects (but I think I was
      able to.)  Not unlike mild alcohol inebriation.
1030: Everything kicks in. (I think the caps took a while to dissolve)
      Only severe motor control difficulties and a general loss of 
      tactile sensation.  Layed down.

At this point I spent the next 3 hours lying in bed, not out of necessity,
I just didn't feel like moving.  I alternated between eyes-open and 
eyes-closed 'images'.  Not acid-like hallucinations, more like visions.  
Static, unchanging (as opposed to 'melting' or 'swirling') images.  I 
distinctly remember three:  The bedspread looked like a far-off mountain 
range; my leg looked like it was hundreds of feet long, and I remember the 
peculiar feeling of rotating in a plane in both directions at once (like 
alcohol 'spins') with no feeling of nasuea.  This was accompanied by the 
inexplicable visual equivalent (of spinning both ways at once).  There was 
a period when I was beset by words rather than images.  At some point I 
crawled across the room and pet the cat.  I believe that walking would have 
been practically impossible.

There were no periods of ego-loss or understanding the mysteries of 
existance, no epiphanies experienced, no greater truths discovered.
But hey, it's a narcotic, not a hallucinogen.

1330: Made it onto the couch, watched TV.  Feeling pretty much 'normal' 
      except for an unplesant, whole-body 'ache' and lack of motor skills.
1600: Able to move about almost normally, ache dimishing.  Tried to eat a 
      cookie (could only nibble) and drink some Diet Coke(*) (could only
      sip.  WAY to sweet).  No nausea.
1700: Able to 'fake' normality (movement, conversation).

The ache continued for another 36 hours, I had very little appetite that
evening and the next day.  Never felt nauseous.  All in all I doubt that I
will do it again.

> If our government would stop the War on Pot, you wouldn't consider doing 
> all this stupid poison just to get a buzz.

uhhhh... Not to be picky and this is just my own PERSONAL view but I
like getting Robo'd much more then getting stoned. (Not that getting
stoned is bad :) Robo is a much more mental trip. When your stoned you
can say "Whoo man I am fucked up..." With dex (dextromethorphan that is)
you almost can't tell that its a chemical making you feel good. Its very
subtle but strong at the same time. You just feel excellent. You feel
free and everyone around seems so nice. Music can become something more
then just music, On one trip I was in a coffehouse and it felt like I
was swimming in a wild rushing torrent of musical notes. One of the most
pleasurable expierences of my life. I do not get that empty headed
feeling I get with pot. It also lasts much longer (for me, I know people
that pot lasts longer for them). Off 6 ozs or so I can get 6 to 8 eight
hours of incredible and intense tripping. For everyone who hasn't tried
it, trust me it is not a cheap buzz. Drinking 6 ozs can be one of the
funest things you can do.

PS- It can also be real cheap if go to the right place. While real
Robitussin can be $5.00 a 4 oz bottle Rite Aid Cough Formula has more
Dex in it, less impurities and costs $3.50 for 8 ozs. I think the 10%
alcohol in the Rite Aid helps it become more intense also.

I ate 25 Vick's gel caps containing 30mg of DM each friday night at about
10:30pm. i was up until 11 the next morning, and fried until about 7am. it
didn't help that the gelcaps also had pseudoephedrine in them, of course.
but it was fantastic. i stayed up at a party with two other stoned guys
'till 6am. it's very comforting to just listen to someone talk when on
robo, and one guy talked for about 5 hours straight. it was fantastic. i
was in another world, and really uncoordinated. it's difficult to describe,
but sort of like mushrooms without the visuals or emotional surges. you're
out of it but you can still function, sort of. plus you can smoke like a
fiend and not feel a thing, so you can indulge your nervous habits. but
every physical movement was a labor. maybe kind of like being a bit
right-brain impaired. definitely recommended. you can steal packs of gel
caps easily from any large grocery store. just stay away from the
guafenisen, or however you spell it. it's hard to keep down and only gets
in the way. i've also eaten Delsym with polystirex - it's not as intense,
but then i only drank one bottle. might want to try two.

Let me provide my testimonial about roboing.  Yesterday I picked up an
8 oz. bottle of generic brand extra-strength cough syrup, containing
only Dextro as its active ingredient.  I immediately downed somewhere
under 4 oz. of the stuff. Taste wasn't as bad as I expected. Chugged a
good deal of water to wash it down anyway, and nibbled on some bread.
Nausea was not a problem at all.

About an hour later it started to hit. Motor skills were definitely
impaired. Pupils were very large. I felt like I was on shrooms, but
without mood-alterations or significant visuals. Television images
appeared to be moving in slow motion like when on acid. Unlike what
I've heard posted here, music did not sound very interesting. This was
a big disappointment since claims to the contrary were what convinced
me to give it a try.  I did not feel particularly euphoric or bad.  My
mood was essentially an unchanged neutral, which was wierd since in
other respects I was definitely "tripping". I kept saying to myself,
"OK, the good part of the trip should be coming soon..." but it never
did! 

Walking was definitely difficult, although mental functioning seemed
to be OK. I carried on many conversations with little difficulty, in
contrast to my experiences with shrooms and 'cid. I was hoping the
amount I consumed would be a mild dose, but I must say I was
significantly affected. I can't imagine what would have happened if I
finished the bottle! It's now 16 hours after the initial consumption.
I slept fine last night, but I still feel the effects. My pupils are
still huge and I still feel like my motor skills are
impaired. (I'm typing much slower now than my usual 100 wpm.).

Is this usual for these effects to persist for so long? It's kinda
a pain because I have work to do! Wierd body chemistry I guess.

In short, I guess it was worth the experience but I can't see any
reason to try it again. It's lasting longer than any shroom or acid
trip I've ever had, and it just ain't nearly as much fun. I'll stick
with pot thank you.

This is obviously not a common reaction to dextromethorphan hydrobromide
but since mine was so severe I felt I should share it for the
sake of others who may be using themselves as a lab animal for
dextromethorphan hydrobromide research.

I was using Robotussin Extra Strength since it seems to have only 
dextromethorphan hydrobromide as an active ingrediant, 15 mg
per teaspoon.  I took 4 ounces of this.  

After about an hour and a half, I got intense itching on my scalp.
This spread over the next hour to the rest of my body.  I took
my clothes off and found that my entire body was bright red 
and was swelling - my face was getting tight and my eyes were
swelling shut.

At that time I took 2 Benedryl and waited out the 20 minutes.
Thankfully, the reaction was stopped.  This was a sufficiently
serious reaction that had the Benedryl not helped within 20 
minutes, I would have headed for the hospital.  I did not
relish the idea of telling them I had drank a half a bottle of
cough medicine - when I was a kid only real down and out types
resorted to cough medicine for getting high (it was about
one step above drinking antifreezei (don't drink antifreeze - it WILL
kill you.  I know, I found a body on the back step once)).ATZ

        I don't know what you'll learn from this, our only recommendation
is to NOT robo.  It's an interesting high, but it feels totally synthetic
and you spend half of your trip in the bathroom.  If you are that hard up
for a high counseling may be in order.
        From now on we're sticking to the all natural mj and 'shrooms.

My set and setting were fine. I was psyched and had set aside all
sorts of excellent music to listen to.  I was among people I was very
comfortable with.  I just don't think the drug mixed well with my body
chemistry. As evidence, it is now 48 hours since I first took it and I
STILL feel some effects of it behind my eyes.  Let me remind the
readers that I only took between 3-4 oz.. That, from what I hear,
seems to be a rather small dose.

Focusing my eyes is very tiring and I'm getting quite sick of this
numbness I feel in my head. It's fading slowly but surely, though, so
by tomorrow morning I'll probably be clear. I've never had any
problems with provenly safe psychedelics like acid and shrooms (well,
I got sick of my stomach on shrooms once, but it was nothing major).

Once again, I never felt particularly bad, just rather neutral.
Although, I can see how mixing the drug with pot might have improved
things.  Now, I've simply had enough of these uninteresting sensations
and hope they go away soon!

After reading, and printing out pages and pages of info on tripping from
Robitussin, I decided to try it last night.  I bought two 4-ounce bottles
of the Robo Maximum Strength Cough (only active ingred= dextro
hydrobromide) for about seven dollars at a supermarket.  
I downed one bottle of the nasty stuff at about 6pm, afterwhich I smoked
a good size bowl.
Since I was quite stoned (and on new weed) I didn't know when the effects
started kicking in, I downed another two ounces from the second bottle,
and by 7 pm I was starting to feel quite weird.

Lemme just say, first, that I am fairly well experienced with other
assorted psychoactives- I tried this out of curiousity since Robo is, of
course, cheap and plentiful.

By 7:15 or so my eyes felt very heavy and, as for the rest of the night,
wouldn't focus in once place for very long... So, as any good tripper
will do, I turned off the lights  :-)
I wasn't getting much in the way of hallucinations at that time anyway. 
Music sounded "thin and boring" compared to LSD or Psilocybin, and I
started becoming too disoriented and unbalanced to walk anywhere.  I
closed my eyes for a while and enjoyed the show- this stuff gave a big
coloful boost to my imagination, and had somewhat the same
"mind-tripping" effects other psychoacts. give.

I felt a bit of stomach discomfort, which is understandable looking back
on how much of it I drank.  I ended up just smoking some more green and
trying to sleep it off.   All in all, it was a pretty heavy buzz, but not
very entertaining and I doubt I would do it again.

I tried my first robodose this friday.  I went up to walmarts and bought 8oz
of Vicks 44.  I was planning on doing it with a friend, but right after I had
downed about 2oz(of the 4 that I did) a girl called and asked me on a date. 
Well, I asked my friend that I was dosing with if it would be alright if I 
ditched him.  He said it was fine(knowing that I don't get too many dates,
especially good looking ones).  I finished off the other 2 oz, then I met her
at a smoking hall.  We sat around and talked awhile, I told her that I was
drugged and that I may not be completely coherent throughout the night ;)  We 
couldn't find a movie to watch, so we went back to my place(she was driving,
obviously) and talked a bit more.  I was just begining to feel the effects when 
we were talking at my house.  (The initial were having trouble walking, and a 
slight distortion in background noise) During when we talked, I had "Indiffence" 
by Pearl Jam on... the music felt great, it just ran through my body.  My whole 
body and mind felt as if they were new, like I was five years old again.  I
actually managed to hold a decent conversation.  I went to put in The Wall (movie) 
by Pink Floyd.  We sat back on my bed and watched it, this is when the visual
distortions began to come on.  At first there were slight trails, then there
were waves, like the fabric of the universe was flowing.  At about "Another
Brick in the Wall part 3" I couldn't get both my eyes in sync, one looked
normal, the  other was rotated off at 45'.  By the end of The Wall, the effects 
were lessening, and I was still feeling good, no hard come down.  She took me to
get my car(I felt as if I could drive now), and we went back to her place.  We
sat down on her bed and talked for another 4 hours.  A really good date, and a
very good trip.  In the morning, I felt fresh, a little tired because of only
getting 3 hours of sleep, but no cotton mouth, no hang over.  
        Unfortunately, my friend, who I ditched :(, went to a party and started
puking.  But he understood(although he says he'll never robodose again ;)  I
would recommend robodosing to anyone who can hold down the syrup...I think it
was the best trip in my life.

Just thought I'd add another data point in our quest for the ultimate over-
the-counter hallucinogen -- dextromethorphane, found in Robitussin DM,
Drixoral, etc.

First off, stay away from anything that combines dextromethorphane with
guaifenisin -- guaifenisin, intended to clear your lungs, will give your
horrible diarrhea at the psychoactive dosage level of dextromethorphane.
I used Drixoral Liquid Caps, each of which is supposed to have 30mg of
dextromethorphane, and I took a dose of 150mg, which, according to reports
here on alt.drugs, is half the psychoactive dose of 300mg.

I started feeling the effects of the liquid caps about 30 minutes after taking
them, indicating that the liquid was released faster that I would have thought.
I noticed that I had trouble balancing -- walking caused a little vertigo.
Also, I had a hard time unclenching my jaw, and when I wasn't thinking about it,
my teeth would chatter as if I was cold. I did not notice any hallucinations,
but I did notice some interesting perspective changes. Just when I thought
that I had taken too low a dose for interesting visuals and I decided to go
to bed, as soon as I closed my eyes I noticed that rather than seeing the
normal random patterns of closed eyelids, that out of the darkness were
forming kaleidescopic patterns, interlocking and turning, like patterns on
a  turkish prayer rug. If I concentrated on visualizing something, it would
spring into being behind my eyelids in full color -- really very startling.

Dextromethorphane seems to interfere with REM sleep, so that come morning, I was still tired, and I ended up going back to sleep for another 8 hours. I would
say that dextromethorphane, like many hallucinogens, is best used when you have
some free time to recover.

So, that was my experience with 150mg -- let's hear some more experiences
and stay away from guaifenisin!

Got ahold of 2 4-oz bottles of "Father John's Medicine"--10mg DXM per
5ml "dose" = 236mg per bottle.  It took me nearly 10 minutes to down
the first bottle--it was a thick black sludge that was supposed to be
licorice but smelled (&tasted) much like FlyNap (that stuff at school
that we use to temporarily knock out fruit-flies).  Needless to say,
I was already feeling nauseous and decided against trying to consume
the second bottle.  By about 45 minutes after consuming the liquid,
I began to notice some unusual effects... the radio (I was listening
to a talk show) began making wierd almost flange-like effects... I
stuttered somewhat when I tried to speak (I do not normally have this
problem).

About an hour into this, I switched the radio over to an REM CD.  The music was
more beautiful than I have ever heard it before--each note
was intense and vibrant.  I stood up and discovered a floating, some-
what euphoric feeling with a little cloudiness of thought.  These
effects seem to be virtually identical to that of Vicodin (sp?), a
narcotic painkiller I had had prescribed for me following outpatient
ear surgery last spring.

The nausea became extremely intense over the next several minutes, and
I finally began vomiting violently into my trash can--however, almost
IMMEDIATELY afterwards, I felt much, much better.  My head felt big
and swollen (not at all unpleasant, however) and the euphoria felt when
walking around was exponentially more intense.  Co-ordination seemed
to be impaired--I tried playing "Tetris" on my computer only to find
it impossible to think and act properly.  I definately would not want
to drive in this condition.

After about four and a half hours, I began to come down gradually.
No "crash" at all--I didn't even fall asleep (as I do with almost
every other substance I've tried).  By about six and a half hours, I
was feeling no effects whatsoever and was able to continue with the
rest of my day.

In short, I would try DXM again (just not in that vile toxic waste
form).  I'd recommend taking an meclizine antiemetic (e.g. Bonine or
Dramamine II)--NOT, however, a dimenhydrinate one (e.g. Dramamine) as
this causes drowsiness--to control the nausea.

=============================================================================

Well, after reading the DXM FAQ posted here (thanks for the very informative
FAQ, BTW), I have to conclude that I am one of those people who don't have
the DXM-processing enzyme on my liver and that is the reason I find DXM
unpleasant enough to stop taking.

In my last DXM experiment, I took 240 mg of DXM in the form of 8 Drixoral
liquid-caps. I was almost immediately (within 30 minutes) so sleepy that
it was hard to stay awake for the rather mild hallucinogenic effects. Finally
I went to sleep.

For the next four days, I had the following symptoms:
- muscle twitches, especially in the hands and jaw muscles, enough to
  make my teeth chatter uncontrollably

- difficulty with urination and orgasm -- almost like the prostate was
  locked up (I have no history of prostate problems -- I'm 29)

- bouts of extreme sleepiness throughout the day, despite 8 hours of sleep

Obviously, DXM affects everyone differently, but I had a bad enough trip so
that I told my brother not to try it.

>>Did you make sure there were no active ingredients listed other than

No--worse than that. I discovered that among the "inactive ingredients" was
...ugh... CASTOR OIL!  Blarg!

>>Meclizine can, in fact, cause drowsiness

Although it's sold as a "non-drowsy" formula?  I know Dimenhydrinate puts me
out quick but have never experienced the slightest effect from Meclizine.

>>DXM by itself shouldn't cause nausea

Probably right.  I'm blaming the castor oil.

Thanx for the help--got ahold of some Robo & will be trying that later today.

=============================================================================

Newsgroups: alt.drugs

My experience with Robo wasn't quite as bad, but remarkably similar.

I took a similar size dose my first try (about 3.5 oz. of a generic
equivalent to Robo extra strength cough). I didn't fall asleep
immediately, and was able to enjoy the "peak" (which I found rather
unremarkable, as I stated in a previous post now in the DXM FAQ). But,
I too suffered after-effects for the next four days.

My pupils were severely dialated for over 24 hours after ingestion, so
my experiences were clearly not entirely psychological.

I had no muscle twitches, but I had this really annoying tightness in
the muscles in my head which made it difficult to concentrate.  I also
had severe hot-flashes around 3 days after ingestion which were really
bizarre and a bit frightening.  Sex was entirely out of the question,
but that could have been partially due to anxiety since I thought I
had broken my brain.

To those trying DXM for the first time, I'd recommend trying a small
amount (< 2 oz.) to make sure you aren't one of us weirdo's without
that enzyme required to break it down. That, or be prepared to waste
of about 3-4 days to very annoying after-effects. Keep in mind I've
had no trouble with most other common psychedelic drugs--I've never
even had a bad trip despite multiple "experiences".

Now that I know I'm not the only one with this problem, I'd like to
get this information added to the DXM FAQ so that others may be spared
this experience.

>>effective.  Remind me to tell you about it some day.
>>--

>NO NEED TO WAIT!
>Tell us now. =)

I had to wait until I could compose my thoughts.
You asked for it...
  I have in the past toyed around with 4-6oz of liquid Tussin, Robo, etc with 
and without guaifenesin (sp?).  My experiences were interesting and fun, but 
nothing as moving as taking two boxes of 10 Drixoral Cough Caps.  Last Friday, 
I decided to go for broke and take 2 boxes.
  I started my journey about 8pm.  Finished the pills in a span of about 30 
minutes.  About 30-45 minutes later, I started feeling the familiar effects of 
drowsiness.  I decided that it would be best to get out and do something 
before I fell asleep and wasted my time.  It was about 9:00, so I went to my 
favorite alternative club where there was an awesome "mind candy" band called 
Mindseye playing.  There weren't more than 20 people in the club including the 
two bands that were playing.  I just kicked back in a booth, closed my eyes, 
and went on an internal trip that lasted at least 45 minutes, although it felt 
like hours.  I had a sensation of moving into a higher realm of thought.  I 
was so focused on the music that it became a part of my consciousness and my 
being.  Openeing my eyes just became a letdown because it reminded me that I 
was in reality. :)  So I just closed them again and enjoyed the phosphenes 
that were running rampant through my brain.  The only part I didn't like was 
the feeling of being in a Doom game without the monsters.  I felt like I was 
running through the corridors and riding the elevators.  Oh, well.  Nobody 
promised that it would be COMPLETELY enjoyable.  Anyway, after the set, I went 
to the bar to order a Miller Lite.  The barkeep said that they didn't have 
Miller Lite.  I asked for Coors Light.  He said he didn't have Coors Light.  
[blank stare with severely dilated pupils]  "What light beers do you have?"  
"Lite."  "Lite?" "Lite."  "Lemme have that, then"  "$1.50" ("Hey, great 
price", I thought)  It was Miller Lite.  Oh, well.  It felt like I was arguing 
for 30 minutes.  Gawd, I hate interacting with people in that condition.  I 
staggered back to my booth (at least it FELT like staggering ... it felt 
REALLY weird to walk) and sipped my beer while watching the band take down 
their equipment.  They looked like a bunch of worker bees from my perspective, 
and is was really interesting to watch.  Drinking was an unusual experience, 
too.  It was like the first time I had ever drunk anything.  All my movements 
were very slow, methodical, and calculated.  After I finished my beer, I went 
down to a techno club I had been meaning to visit.  It was about midnight.  
I know that this is a big lapse in time.  I guess I wasted 2 1/2 hours in that 
bar listeneing to the jukebox and watching the band.  It was only 4 
blocks, but the way my legs were moving, it felt like I was walking 
stiff-legged the whole way.  Fortunately, it was a slow night on my city's 
version of Bourbon St., and I only passed about 5 people on the way.  The 
doorman was the next big hurdle.  Actually, I managed to keep myself fairly 
composed.  He warned me that it was kinda slow, and I went into a repeat of 
the beer discussion.  "Slow?" "Slow." "Okay." (trying to avoid giving myself 
away, even though my pupils filled my eyeballs)  I handed him the two bucks he 
asked for and walked in.  I found an empty couch and plopped down.  It was 
heavily padded and had a low back.  Perfect for slouching.  The DJ was playing 
a fantastic mix of techno and classic rock.  As the night wore on, she was 
playing almost constant techno.  They have a light show that is really 
something to be seen.  The dance floor is surrounded by mirrors that reflect 
the blue lights from the bar and make it look like a cityscape from the year 
2020.  VERY impressive in my condition.  The only times I got up were to go to 
the john twice and to the bar once for water.  Walking got stranger and 
stranger.  I think I was having trouble keeping my balance, but I don't 
remember staggering.  The worst part was the feeling that I was choking on my 
uvula.  My mouth felt dry, and water wasn't helping.  It must have been the 
anaesthetic effects of DXM.  I stayed there for two hours in the same spot 
only moving the three times I mentioned.  I was still not bored, but I figured 
that since it was 2am, it was about time to get home.  This may have been a 
mistake.  The streetlights had started tracing, and the blinking lights were 
playing hell on my perception.  In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have 
driven home, but I was broke, so a cab was out of the question, and there was 
no way I could have sobered up.  I didn't feel drunk.  It just felt like all 
my surroundings were foreign.  I payed extra-close attention to my driving, 
but still nearly jumped out of my skin at the sight of police.  I got home in 
one piece and fell asleep to the mellow sounds of Pink Floyd's Ummagumma disc 
2.  I woke up around 9:30am, fully alert.  Checked my eyes.  Fully dilated.  
Made an excuse to get out of the house, wearing shades.  Went to see a movie 
with a friend, which was pretty fun.  I was still feeling a bit weird.  The 
dark theater helped me relax.  Got out of the movie and went home.  My eyes 
were normal by this time, although I still felt a little strange.  That 
feeling lasted until about 7pm.  So the brunt of the trip laster about 12 
hours and the after-effects lasted another 11.  WOW!
  Will I try this again?  Yes.  Would I suggest that somebody else try this?  
Yes.  What will I do next time?  Take 3 boxes and drink more beer.  I heard it 
is very synergistic.  I did not see the colored blobs that people refer to, 
unless the light show was this effect, and I just didn't notice. :)  Anyway, I 
had no nausea or other ill effects.  I have sworn off the liquid stuff, 
because it's too hard to get down.

So what's the deal?

Subject 1 ingested 3 30mg caplets, followed in two hours, by 2 more,
followed in two more hours with 2 more... no perceptible results, or
results so mild they might well have been placebo.

Subject 2 ingested 5 30mg caps, followed four hours later with 2 more, same
effect as S1.

The next day, S2, a determined experimentor, broke 6 caps into a swallow of
juice (tastes awful :) and still got nothing.

Caps were from two seperate boxes of Drixoral cough caps, no other
ingredients besides DXM-hbr.....no other drugs of any kind were present in
the system....

Is there some magic "open-sesame" thing you gotta do with this stuff?  What
are the odds that two people, non-blood relations, would both have this
Citochrome - 450 enzyme or whatever?  

Perhaps if the dose were doubled to more like 300mg instead of the 120-150
that seemed such a prudent figure given the DXM FAQ info...?  (it was
deemed desirable to avoid the second stage of the experience as it sounded
from the descriptions far less pleasurable than the lo-dose effects...)

Does the syrup work better than the caps?

Or is this all a great big hoax put on by the DEA to lure us all out of the
woodwork and down to the drugstore?

try taking at least ten+ of the pills at once -- be sure you're not
getting anything besides DXM.  That should give you over 300mg which
should be psychoactive.

Its no hoax -- if you don't get off at all from 300-400mg you've got a bizzare
metabolism.

Well, I got around to doing this DXM thing this weekend.  I drank a bit less
than one third of an 8 oz bottle of Robo max. strength (whichever particular
flavor has only DXM) so I estimate in the neighborhood of 220 mg of DXM.
Now, I have done a lot of LSD in the past, and none of these weenie doses
either...so I figured this would be pretty wimpy at the dosage I took
(would have taken more, but I'm on paxil, an MAO inhibitor...wanted to 
test the waters..)  Anyway, I was pretty much wrong.  BTW I weigh about
160 lbs..  anyways, it took longer than I thought to really come on--don't
have an exact figure but I might say 2 hours to peak?  

It's a strange drug.  In some ways, I felt totally normal.  Speaking 
normally was quite easy.  Moving around and performing feats of dexterity,
however, was not.  In fact, the only problem with speaking felt like a
lack of coordination of my mouth.   Walking, after sitting down for 2 hours
for dinner at a restaurant, was really bizarre.  Could not feel myself
touching the ground, felt certain I was walking funny and would be 
spotted--felt like I was taking baby steps.  Vision was blurred.  Food
was totally nauseating--don't even think about it.  

Music was interesting, but perhaps a bit "flat."  

A very hard to describe trip, at least hard to describe after one shot--
don't know what was characteristic and what was that one trip.

Don't underestimate this drug.

Also--whatever the cost, the pill for is probably worth it.  I did not
think I would have so much trouble getting the shit down.  I mixed it
with OJ, even, and it was totally horrible.

My question:  anybody have sex on it yet?  I was planning on it, but was
a bit nauseated from the food I ate. (I believe)  Worth doing?  

another question:  anyone mix pot with this yet?  LSD?  effects?  if not, 
any reasons not to?

: sensual trips i know of, but i usually feel like i can't really go
: anywhere, which is too bad, sometimes.

sorry abouyt not quoting, but i can't be bopthered.
well, i'm currently on the tail enbd of a  250 mg dose of
dxm, and fuck i feel *GOOD*.
i can't imagine it being possible to have a bad trip on this shit.
oh, man, i feel so good.
well, if i can get this posted withougth screwing up roayally i will ta

dxm for the first time... we had such fun, oh damn i can't see the keyboard
anymore am i typing still?  oh, i can see the screen so i am.
i am going away.  TRY DXM, IT'S FUN.

I robo-ed for the first time in months this weekend.  Did more than I ever
had before, here's the story:

8:15 pm:  Friend and I each take 5 Robitussin cough caps, and rinse them
down with 4 oz of Robo DM syrup.  Taste is worse than I remember.  Wrigley
Spearmint really helps kill the taste.

8:30ish: begin feally a little funky.  Stomach is a little bit
uncomfortable.  Friend says she feels a little nauseous also.  We ate
before hand, so the stomach discomfort was not as bad as before.

8:45ish: Very light headed.  Tracers begin showing up on just about
everything.  We get to another friends house, and sit down to watch tv.

9:00 :  Seriously feeling effect.  Head spinning slighty, not bad. 
Stomach discomfort gone.  Limbs feel unconnected to body.  I notice that I
have been watching tv for 15 minutes, and have no idea what I am watching.
TV sound is turned off and stereo is truned on.  I find it very hard to
concentrate on anything for more than about a second.  Music, which I
normally get into, I can't really listen to.  Repeated attemps at
conversation fail because I can't remember what I am saying as I say it.  
total inability to grasp concept of time.  A friend's sentence take
forever to finsh, and I completely forget what is said as soon as he is done.
When I close my eyes, all sorts of incredible hallucinations kick in. 
When my eyes are open, I see everything as normal, but have NO idea what
I'm looking at.  

10:30ish  Friend gets pizza.  I am totally unable to eat.  Wierd, seeing
as how often I get the munchies.  I can no longer move my head without
totally losing contact with reality.  As long as I am talking, I'm fine. 
Time flies and crawls at the same time.  Truely wierd.

Evening progresses until I have to leave(couldn't take beeing on that
couch any longer)

Midnight:  Go back to friends house.  Have to catch a ride because I am
TOTALLY unable to operate an automobile, assuming I had driven in the
first place.  Lye down on floor.  Carpet, which is normally uncomfortable,
is quite nice right now.  Close my eyes, and trip like a motherfucker. 
All sorts of weird shit flies through my head.  It is suddenly half an
hour later.  I decide(for some stupid reason) that I need to walk home
now.  Normally about a mile, I can walk it in 15 minutes if I really take
my time.  As I walk, I realize that I don't feel connected to my legs, I'm
just "floating" along, above the ground.  I feel as if I'm going to fall
any minute, but never do.  I make it home, and down the stairs into my
room.  I make it into my bed, where I close my eyes, and trip out for
another three hours, when my phone rings, and I end up explaining how to
use Tlenet to one of my friends.  After a rather lengthy conversation, I
slip into unconsciousness completely.

Next day:  I am still totally out to lunch, and am still unable to grasp
time.  Things just fly by unnoticed.  Kinda cool, kinda strange.  I like
it, but it better be gone by tommorow.

I tried posting this on Tuesday, but it does'nt seem to have 
gotten out, so here it is again...

  Well, after reading all the messages on experiences with cough syrup, I 
decided to try it for myself. Last friday, a friend and I went down to 
the local supermarket, read the ingredients on the back of the cough 
medicine boxes, did some simple dosage math, and settled on a 20 pack of 
Drixoral Cough Liquid caps. We took them at around 10:00 that night, and had 
a pretty good time. 

Here's a log of what happened. We were writing it as it happened while we 
could.


  10:03 Both: Took 300mg(10 capsules) each of Drixoral Cough Liquid Caps... 
might have been a bit much for a first time try, but we were feeling 
daring...(and we wanted it to be good) :)... 

  10:47 Both: Think we're starting to get a general 'nice' feeling

  10:57 Jon: Colors seem to be getting brighter.  Listening to Nirvana's 
Bleach album, music seems kind of 'thin' but it's pretty easy to get into.

  11:16 Jon: Colors realy bightening.

  11:22 Jon: Gettin into it... Kurt does'nt seem to be having much fun
yet..

  11:53 Both: Went outside to have a smoke and walk around.

  12:07 Both: came back in, Jon: Things seemed to realy be setting in. I 
first noticed it when I walked back up the stairs to come back into the 
house. I felt very bouncy, as if I were going to keep floating up... I also
felt it when I stood up from a chair. Around this time I also started to
knotice things bouncing around a bit when I tried to fix my eyes on them.

  12:20 I'm definately getting weird, Kurt still is'nt getting anything...

  12:26 Turned off the lights and the monitor, stopped writing this log as 
things happened. Listened to music in the dark and had a pretty good time 
singing along. Now I popped in Nirvana's Nevermind. It was more melodic and 
cooler to listen to. I thought the more psychedelic parts of the music would 
be more stimulating, but it was realy basic song structure and melody that 
got me going... Time started to get distorted. Could'nt keep my eyes from 
wandering.

  1:00(or so)  Jon: Time getting realy distorted. Songs seem to last for
hours, still nothing realy for Kurt.. We just lied around and listened...

Things realy hit around 1:30... All I can say is that I was FUCKED *UP*!!!
My memory from then on is realy screwed up, but I remember realizing just
how fried I was when I found myself sitting up on the bed with my legs
shaking, and asking kurt if they were shaking. He told me to stop shaking
them (By now he seemed pretty fried too) and when I stopped (It was fairly
hard, I could'nt quite remember 'how' to). It felt weird stopping, so I
just let them shake (They stopped when I laid back down). Standing up was
hard and so was talking (although that didd'nt stop me). Just laying down,
talking and listening was actually quite enjoyable.

Things I noticed:

These things are DANGEROUS! I almost choked trying to swallow one of the
pills :) (Realy though, Make sure you have something to wash them down with)

We were VERY heavily stoned. I remember Kurt remarking 'This is what
retarded people must feel like' :). I just could'nt think straight at all...

I seemed to instantly verbalize most of my thoughts. According to
Kurt, I talked almost the whole time about absolutely nothing... I wonder
if I would have talked so much if there weren't anyone there with me...I found
myself contradicting myself often. "I want to try and go outside. No I
don't." I also said completely senseless things He would ask me a question 
like "Do you want to try and stand up?" and I'd say something like "No, 
because you'll try to kill me, and the windows can't handle that." Weird...

Part of our talking was telling each other all of our deepest darkest
secrets. I can only remember a few of the milder ones, but I know I told
him things about myself I would'nt tell ANYONE normally... Luckily our
memories of the experience are very bad, and many of the things we told
each other were absolute hogwash (I distincly remember "Hey man, I gotta 
tell you something. I have sex with furniture" "That's ok man, I have sex 
with guitars..."). The next day however, we both felt like a tremendous
weight had been taken off of our chest, and I think we're much better
friends.

I didn't seem to hallucinate as I thought I would. In fact, I realy
could'nt imagine anything visual at all. When I closed my eyes, I just saw
kind of a slightly more intense normal-closed-eye pattern, and I just felt
a general 'swirling' feeling in my mind. Kurt, however, reported seeing
Sonic the Hedgehog come running at him a few times. :)

I knoticed my body seemed generaly numbed, and severely  in my mouth and face.
The numbing of my mouth added to the difficulty of talking, and I think I had
cottonmouth, but it might have just been the numbness.

At one point, for some reason I told Kurt to make sure all of his fingers
were still on because DXM can me bad for them. He started nervously
tugging on them to see if they were loose.I realy freaked him out :-).

Moving around and dancing was REALY cool. I was very disoriented and had a
bit of a hard time standing up, but I diddn't get motion sick or anything,
and moving felt great. Looking back, I'm glad nobody sober was watching me
dance, I pretty much made a fool of myself :)...

For part of the most intense part of the trip I seemed to be just 'Out of
my head', Like the rest of my mind just wandered off and left me to just
kinda lay there and stare at things. I also had a few 'waking up'
experiences. It's hard to explain, but it was if I were dreaming, and then
woke up to find things exactly as they were in the dream.

MIZ only got nauseous twice for short periods, and it was very mild. 

Sometime around 4:00, Both of us decided to go so sleep (I wasnt realy 
tired, it was a decision we just kinda made) No weird dreams or anything...

The next day, I didnt feel down after the trip, probably because I was
still feeling the effects quite a bit. My memory was'nt doing to good, I
felt mildly stoned, and I still got that funny feeling whenever I got up.

For the record, I'm only around 130 pounds, and Kurt is... Ehh.. I don't
know, but he's 6'2 and slightly overweight.

  Overall, this was quite an enjoyable (and weird) experience, and I plan
on doing this again this weekend with maybe a few other friends, a higher
dose, and some more appropriate music (although as the trip realy got 
intense, I realy just ignored the music).
  At around 10 bucks for 20 capsules (30mg each) it's fairly
cheap (It would have been cheaper if I had been willing to down all that 
nasty syrup), and from what I've seen so far, it seems to be legal.

  Well, my fingers are tired, and so am I, so I guess I'll stop now :)
It should have only Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide 
(and maybe a little alchohol) as an active ingredient).  Just make sure 
you don't have anything too important to do the day afterwards, you'll still 
feel it the next day, and might not sleep very well.

It sucks, dudes.  Me and a friend, we got Drixoral Cough Caps last night.
I did 390mg, he did 450mg. If you like getting whacked out of your brain,
then maybe try this, but it's too intense and wierd for me (and my friend,
who's done LSD and shrooms.)  Some parts were fun, actually, but too much of
it wasn't.

There sure is a lot of interest in dextromethorphan on this conference
all of a sudden...  Is this a new thing or does it come around on a
regular basis?

Anyway, I thought I'd give it a whirl.  Tried it twice, around 350 mg
per dose, the first time by itself and the second time with a number of
good solid bong hits.  (I managed to find Drixoral gel-caps the second
time, which made it much much easier to get down.)
The first time, I felt seriously drunk.  My body felt light, movement
was effortless, and I had a hard time concentrating on anything.  On the
other hand, I remained lucid enough to play a game of Diplomacy with my
friends (although the French were acting sort of erratically that night
:)  My hands got red and puffy, and at one point my scalp itched
intensely, leading me into a strangely satisfying prolonged scratching
session.  I experienced that sort of tingly stomach sensation that
usually heralds an oncoming acid trip, and this feeling lingered for
about two days.  There was no hangover, but I still felt sort of buzzed
the next day - not unpleasant, but disorienting.
The second time, I got really, really dumb.  I could watch TV or listen
to someone talking to me for several minutes and not be able to recall a
single thing.  I had some trippy visuals - Joe Bob Briggs became
three-dimensional (on TV), and then everything in the room became
extremely three-dimensional (moreso than usual).  There was also some
wavering and crawling of the stucco patterns on the ceiling, but I
didn't notice much in the way of visuals later in the trip.  Hell, I
didn't notice much of _anything_ later in the trip.  I was conscious,
but not really aware.  Seriously meaningful thoughts churned up inside
me like undercurrents in an underground ocean, but my verbal processing
ability was so disabled that I couldn't put them into words or utter
them.  This inability to put words to thoughts was the most disturbing
aspect of the trip - without words, I couldn't really understand what I
was examining mentally, but just "look" at it and wonder.  I did manage
to get across to my friend that I wondered whether really dumb people
feel like this all the time (not unlike wondering whether schizophrenics
or autistic people feel like people on acid a lot of the time).  He
basically agreed.  I eventually drifted off to sleep, and if I dreamed I
don't remember it.  The weird stomach feeling lasted about three days
this time.  I'm not entirely sure (a week later) that I've fully
recovered.
My opinion?  Interesting, but not a lot of fun.  If you like getting
very stupid and lying around, this might be your cup of tea.  I
personally don't like being so incapacitated, especially mentally.  Even
very drunk people have more mental wherewithal than I did the second
time (the pot probably played a big role here).  I don't know if I'll do
the scientifically logical next step and try 750 mg before reaching a
final conclusion or not, but I think I've been and done and don't need
to go back.

I tried it for the first time with a friend just recently.  First off, the
Cough Caps sound like a good idea... the Vicks we ingested was absolutely
vile.  I'd sooner drink essence o' shrooms.  As such, I was only able to
consume about 180mg (but I've got under 140lbs of body weight, so I
considered it a 'decent' low-dose).  It was a peculiar high, sort of a
cross between alcohol and a psychedelic.  I experienced nearly everything
the faq said I would: altered aural perception (big deal), loss of
coordination, and a desire to move about as much as possible.  Dancing
around was great fun.  My speech was affected; I kept repeating parts of
my sentences.  

One interesting aspect: We took the junk at about 3:00 pm.  Somewhere around
8:00 or so, I noticed that my pupils were dilated somewhat.  I checked again
about an hour later and they were completely dilated.  The faq mentioned
nothing about this (or did it?  Did I miss it?) and so I was intrigued, but
short of a few trails, I noticed no hallucinations.  That is, of course,
until I tried to get to sleep at about 11:00 that night.  I tossed and turned
for awhile until I grew tired of fighting it and I turned on the light.  And
I was frying! (for lack of a better word).  No, not full-blown, but I had
definite movement and the curtains were breathing deeply.    Has anyone else
experienced this sort of thing?  Of course, we did smoke some grass while we
were on the stuff, so that might have contributed...

I guess I'll have to dry a "high-dosage" before I can say I'm done with
the stuff, but it's not really that great of a high (my opinion, folks). 
If you want hearing enchancement, you can smoke grass or take piracetam (sp?).
Drink some wine and your coordination will be as bad as mine was.  Plus, the
wine tastes a heck of a lot better than the syrup does!   Keep drinking and
soon your speech will be affected, too.

Well, this might not be real interesting, but here is my story of DXM.
I got a 10 pack of Vicks 44 capsules(30mg DXM, 60 mg pseudoephedrine)
and started taking them at 6:00 P.M. I took one every 6 minutes for an
hour. Used pepsi to help them go down. After realizing that 300 mg was
the minimum dosage for effects, I decided to go buy another pack of ten,
which was downed in much the same fashion from 7:00 to 8:00. So that was
600 mg of DXM in two hours spread out evenly.

        I started feeling nauseas and noticed that I kept dropping
things!!! %^)  I decided to take a bath because I was sore from V-Ball
earlier in the day. The water seemed very hot and I was feeling slightly
"spaced" so I rinsed with a cool shower and got dressed. I had Floyd,
Mr. Bungle and some other cool stuff in the cd player so decided to just
lie down and enjoy. I was tired and basically cat napped until four the
next morning. The pseudoephedrine definitely kept me up, and the nausea
never really went away, but did abate to  a great extent. Anytime I
tried to walk was met with dizziness and a lot of stumbling. I finally
slept from 4:00A.M. until 6:30 which is when I got up and got ready for
school. Most of the day was the same "spaced" and generally out of it
feeling and more then one person used the word "spent" to describe my
physical condition.

        Although I wouldn't describe the experience as extremely
unpleasant, the nausea was definitely a downer and I wish it could be
avoided. On looking back, I realize that I was hallucinating somewhat,
with the trim around the upper edge of my room becoming tilted and one
of the Dolphin posters being something other than a dolphin(it reminded
me of my shirt) The poster had a very weird 3d effect to it. What I mean
is that the edge of the poster seemed to be coming out of the wall. I
also feel that the sleepiness caused by the V-Ball mixed with the
restlessness of the pseudoephidrine didn't help. I am 5-9 and weigh 170
and am in moderately good shape so the dosage I feel wasn't excessive.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Any suggestions on how to avoid
the nausea would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for playing!!!!

I tried DXM for the first time about two weeks ago.  I took 300 mg
(10 Drixoral Cough Caps @ 30mg each).  Result:  no effect.  I took the
10 pills over the course of about 20 minutes chased with plenty of water.
I did take them on a relatively full stomach, though, so maybe that 
was part of the problem.

So, on to my question:  I'm 6'3", 280 lbs., and in relatively good 
health . . . what dosage should I try next?  Should I stick with 
300 mg but take on an empty stomach?  Or should I try to increase the
dosage?  I'm more interested in the low dosage effects of DXM at this
point, particularly the enhancement of listening to music.

If you have a suggestion, please drop me some e-mail as well as posting.
I read alt.drugs regularly, but my newsfeed tends to be slow, and I
need the info as soon as possible.

I finally decided to try DXM I started with 120mg and noticed a slight
buzz but also a huge decrease in sensitivity to pain. I banged my hand
into something bending back a finger nail a bit, nothing terrible but
normally would hurt alot, it barely hurt at all. Unlike alcohol which
makes you numb I seem to have full sensation of touch everywhere, but
things that should hurt don't. Has DXM ever been used for pain relief
the 120mg dosage seems to have much less mind altering effect than most
pain relievers.

a few nights ago i tried my highest dose of dextrometorphan yet,  about 
500 mg (i had only had up to about 350 previously, with absolutely no
side effects  other than that horrible itching, and  even that was only
light and for a few minutes).
anyway, i seem to have  had quite an odd reaction this time...
at first i started getting higher and higher like normal, but then
after about an hour and a half things started to get a wee bit worse...
i was feeling a bit itchy, but not too bad... when i started  scratching
insanely, it got the attention of a few  of my freinds who hadn't done
anything.   they said that i was bright red and had a fever of like  103...
this  bothers me rather a bit, since such things  are not a good  sign...
anyway, then i proceeded to scratch like crazy, luckily my face didn't
get itchy, since i discovered the next day that too much scratching makes
you look like a survivor of the plague from poe's "masque of the read death",
if there were survivors...
next i began to get nauseous, so i went into the bathroom to puke.  while in
there, i  got incredible cold sweating, to the point that i was  dripping
with sweat but had goosebumps ( i might still have had a fever , but as far
as i could tell i was freezing).
so i managed  to live, apparently...

but, what i want to know, if anyone out there has a guess, is why i flushed
and had such a high fever, when i haven't ever before, and hadn't taken
substantially more than my previous max?

a, um, friend of mine did a 4oz. bottle of robo max cough,
and he practically had a fever as well, had the overwhelming
need to throw up, didn't, and had a bad stomach ache the
next day.  and on 300mg, he felt like his head was in a vice
and couldn't walk very well, but that's about it.  the only
good thing was that he talked alot.

I wish I got off as well as you guys did...  About 2am last night I took
300mg (Drixoral Liquid Caps).  Needless to say, nothing interesting happened
for a while, except that I thought I saw the walls breathing like the early
stages of an acid trip, so I dropped off to sleep until I awoke on the verge
of being sick.  To make a long story short I was violently sick (toilet and
bucket, yum) for about 4 hours, happy happy, and even now 22 hours later I'm
still dizzy and lethargic.  Maybe I'm one of the 1 in 10 people who don't
have the enzyme to process DXM, who knows. 

To put this in perspective, my drug use is so recreational I'm almost clean. 
Only tripped twice, 5 tabs then 2 the second time, and mj just puts me to
sleep.  Never a big alcohol drinker either.  Only reason I like acid is the
thought processes it opens up, and dollar for dollar it's a better drug in
my opinion.  Now DMT, that's piqued my interest recently...

Hi there ...

yesterday (27.05.94) my friend and I tried DXM. We each took 200mg in the
form of the German brand cough syrup "Arpha Hustenstiller" (apricot-flavor
disgusting stuff, that :) ).

We ingested it about 19:00 hours. First signs of intoxication set in about
20:00. Unlike the first time, where we tried 133,3mg DXM each, there were no
signs of hyperactivity. Instead we experienced a calm and warm feeling, which
got more intense while the DXM started to do its work.

My friend (4T4) experienced some slight nausea during the first half hour, 
which vanished after eating a salad (green salad, soy-beens, onions, cucumbers
and french dressing as topping ;-).

Then we both began listen to (German) trance music (Cosmic Baby, etc). 
4T4 kept on asking me (4A4) what I was feeling. What wasn4t much at that
time. But short period later I noticed that my stereo sounded much better than
it used to. So we kept on listening to the CD. At about 22:00 another friend
of us appeared and I had the feeling that the DXM effects were setting out.

As 4T4 had the same impression we decided to smoke some hash (MJ). Than it 
all began ... :)

WWWHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!

At first the feeling was only describable as a very light hash stoning. But
it didn4t stop there. As time went by the effect got more and more intense
and ended in something which is only comparable to a very strong XTC high.
We both HAD to get up and dance (to the same CD). We were both VERY high!

Absolutely incredible!!!

These effect lasted about 20 minutes and began to dissolve (slowly). While
getting down we both had the impression as if somebody had cloaked our heads.
Everything (sight and hearing) was dampened. Our environment seemed to be a
part of a movie. Nothing of it belonged to reality. While getting sober
reality came back :)

At about 23:20 we both felt nearly sober again and so we decided to some hash
again.

This time MJ turned to feel more like alcohol which was also quite funny.
But the effect always dropped after about 15-20 minutes. And we had to
smoke some more. But later it was hard to move because we were so lazy due
to the MJ.

All in all it was a very funny, positive and intense experience.

Note: Beware if you try this yourself, I realy cant imagine, what
      would have happened if I had smoked any more ! I guess it hadnt been
      that funny.
