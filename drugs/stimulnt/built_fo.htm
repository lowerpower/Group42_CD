<H3>Methamphetamine has reclaimed a place in the lexicon of "party" drugs. 
Hailed by nocturnal adventurers, condemned by raver idealists, is speed a 
sleepless dream or an addictive nightmare? </H3><P>
by Todd C. Roberts<P>
<P>
<B>Here at the end of the millennium, the pace of modern life seems fleeting </B>
-- a whirl of minutes, hours and days. In dealing with the changes, 
humans have equipped themselves with the tools to move faster, more 
efficiently. At the same time a dependence for the marketing, high-speed 
transportation and pharmacology of this modern age has evolved. In a race 
to outdo ourselves, we have moved dangerously toward the fine line 
between extinction and evolution. Therefore, the human capacity to handle 
the velocity becomes a fragile balance.<P>
  Our generation (see Gen X, 20-somethings) could be considered the 
sleepless generation. An age of society's children weaned on the ideals 
of high-speed communication and accelerated culture has prided itself in 
mastering many of the facets of human existence -- doing more, sleeping 
less. The machines of this age have in a way enabled us to create a 
24-hour lifestyle. We have pushed the limits of the modern world further 
-- ATMs, high-speed modems, smart bombs and bullet trains. However, the 
limitations of human existence, like sleep, may still provide the 
stumbling block for infinite realization. That is, without chemical aid.<P>
<P>
<B>In many ways, capitalism fuels the idea.</B> Our society is based upon the 
mass consumption of these substances. Cultural ideals, while seemingly 
benevolent as "Have a Coke and a smile" have sold the link to chemical 
substances like caffeine and nicotine to "the good life." Today, 
stimulants are the bedrock for consumer culture. For our generation, this 
appeal was heightened by raising the stakes in the '80s on what it meant 
to have fun.<P>
  Late night clubs, high speed music and 24-hour lifestyles brought the 
specter of drugs to the fold as a necessity for being able to attain 
more. Leaps away from the psychedelics of the '60s, in the '80s these 
stimulant drugs became tools -- utilitarian devices to gain wealth, 
intelligence and prestige. Sleep became a barrier for success. Dreams 
were the frivolous luxuries of childhood.<P>
  Raves, founded equally in the post-conservative underground late-'80s 
and the chaotic early-'90s, are part of the pastiche that has 
consequently become more dream-like, more unreal and still somehow 
manageable. The <I>hyperreality</I> of today goes hand in hand with the drugs 
being administered.<P>
<P>
<B>It's 6 a.m. Around the speaker bins are small packs of animated dancers</B> 
grinding their feet into the floor and shaking their hands in front of 
them. The lookie-loos and weekend warriors have long since gone home. 
Absent from their faces are the smiles of midnight, replaced by the 
blank, vacant stare of sleepless dreams. They have a name in the rave 
community, they are "tweakers." "Tweaking," the common name for sniffing 
lines of speed, the drug methamphetamine, (popular for its availability 
and price) has somehow replaced MDMA and LSD as the perfect rave drug, 
allowing users the clear head and stamina to keep dancing long after 
their bodies have gone to sleep.<P>
  A prominent opinion during the aftermath of the Los Angeles Summer of 
Love was that speed killed the rave scene. Where speed had been seen in 
every scene from metal to the punk scene, for some reason it was shocking 
for some to see methamphetamine take hold, even though MDMA (an 
amphetamine-like substance) had been circulating for years. Some likened 
the rise to the quash of young newcomers, some equated it with the greed 
of drug dealers. Judging from today's roster of events throughout the 
nation, raves are still alive and well. However, many old-schoolers have 
been turned off by the newbie vibe that came with speed's rise in 
popularity. Some were casualties themselves of the drug's addictive 
nature. Others say that speed alone is what fuels the rave scene, keeping 
it from dying.<P>
<P>
<B>Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887.</B> First popularized by 
pharmaceutical company Smith Kline & French as the nasal inhaler, 
Benzedrine, in 1932. (Amphetamine is widely known as a bronchio dialator, 
allowing asthmatics to breathe more freely.) A probable direct reaction 
to the Depression and Prohibition, the drug was used and abused by 
non-asthmatics looking for a buzz. Jazz great Charlie "Bird" Parker would 
remove the inhaler's Benzedrine strip and soak it in his coffee.<P>
  Methamphetamine, more potent and easy to make, was discovered in Japan 
in 1919. The crystalline powder was soluble in water, making it a perfect 
candidate for injection. Also smoking the drug creates a similar rush. It 
is still legally produced in the U.S., most often prescribed for weight 
loss, sold under the trade name Desoxyn. As the name "speed" suggests, 
amphetamines elevate mood, heighten endurance and eliminate fatigue, 
explaining the drug's popularity with the military. Hitler was supposedly 
injected with methamphetamine.<P>
  Speed rose to popularity in California, home of many of the largest 
meth labs in the country, riding on the back of biker gangs. Bikers have 
been historically blamed for introducing the drug into the psychedelic 
'60s, subsequently bringing down a whole Summer of Love with violence and 
angst. Since then, speed has been given a bad rap. It has been called a 
trailer park drug for decades, due to the fact that it can be cooked up 
so cheaply and easily. It's the drug of choice for long-distance truckers 
and college students pulling all-nighters. Over the counter ephedrine, or 
"white crosses," has taken the place of pharmaceutical amphetamine as an 
easy-to-get alternative.<P>
  What is often misunderstood is the relationship between speed and 
crystal meth. The common reference to speed in the rave scene is the 
methamphetamine salt (HCl powder), whereas "crystal" usually refers to 
the free-base form of methamphetamine. Another form "Ice," a 
higher-grade, purer form of crystal meth is smoked, a single hit creates 
a high that lasts for hours and several hits can wire a user for days. 
However, its high price prevents it from taking hold. A gram of "ice" 
commands about $5,000 on the street.<P>
<P>
<B>Speed came to the rave scene in 1992.</B> Theory: when the parties in '92 
started to get really good, the police were cracking down more on the 
prime-time parties -- partiers needed to find late-night/early morning 
activities like after-hours. Consequently, the price of taking 3-4 pills 
of ecstasy became too expensive an option, speed took over as an easier 
to get and cheaper alternative. Now, the standard street price in Los 
Angeles for a gram of speed is approximately $100, where ecstasy sells 
for approx. $150 or more.<P>
  One major misconception is the link between methamphetamine and ecstasy 
[MDMA]. Ecstasy does not necessarily contain speed, yet both contain the 
methamphetamine structure. However, each affects a far different region 
of the brain resulting in different psychological effects. Ecstasy 
primarily effects serotonin in the brain -- the center for 
self-satisfaction and emotional systems. Speed affects dopamine 
primarily, a neurotransmitter linked to pleasure and reward. (Oddly, 
alcohol also affects a dopamine center.) Often, MDMA is "cut" with speed 
to lower the street price of the drug, thus changing the overall effect. 
The two are similar in chemical makeup but one cannot be made from the 
other. Slightly changing the chemical makeup produces a wholly different 
effect in the human brain. While both have addictive potential, speed, 
because of its dopamine ties, is much more profoundly addicting. 
Qualitatively, speed and ecstasy supposedly give off "glows" that are far 
different.<P>
  Ecstasy has a definite link to the rave scene. In some places it is 
synonymous. Speed too has been linked to the rave scene -- some say it 
was the death of the ideal. What's unusual, given the qualitative 
similarities between the two, are the differing opinions about speed. 
While many admit openly to taking MDMA, they will not condone or even 
accept speed as a "valid" recreational drug. The stigma that goes with 
"tweaking" can be quite severe.<P>
  "Speed is evil," says Dominic. "I have seen more people's lives twisted 
up off that drug than anything else in the world. I was first introduced 
to it about five years ago by a girl I was dating. I basically watched 
her use of it turn from an occasional party thing to basically the 
sustenance of her life. Her body withered way, and everything she did 
revolved around speed."<P>
  "Speed does not belong in the underground scene," he continues. 
"Something that is so damn negative could never co-exist with the 
positive ideals that we try to promote. If you want to get amped, feel 
energy and stay up all night, try alternatives -- using speed just to 
stay up is a total cop out."   However, his opinion is that ecstasy has 
opposite effects and could actually save the rave scene. "[MDMA] induces 
a sense of spiritual enlightenment, happiness, and sometimes social 
understanding, something that could never be achieved by shoving a few 
rails of driveway cleaner up your nose."<P>
  "I'm all for consciousness expansion, even if by chemical means," says 
another critic, Michael. "Preferably organic chemistry. The problem is 
major parts of the scene moved away from enlightenment, transcendence and 
betterment of the self through involvement in community"<P>
  A regular user of the drug is DJ Velour, 19, also finds some criticism 
for it. "I believe that speed/crystal is one of the most psychologically 
addictive drugs around," he says "Whenever I get tired or wish I had more 
energy, I always think how nice it would be to have some speed. In that 
respect, I am addicted, because it is definitely a part of my thought 
pattern now. And I haven't done speed for over 3 weeks now." Even though 
his experiences have not all been good, he is still connected to the 
drug.<P>
  "Amphetamines, in my mind are not evil," says Velour, hoping to defend 
the drug against his critical peers. "They are simple chemicals, if there 
is anything evil it is the society we live in which dictates that they 
are illegal and thus makes them harder to get."<P>
  "I will admit one thing, it is very addictive," he goes on. "Once you 
take it a few times, you will continue to think about it after you stop. 
I haven't done speed for a month now and still some days will go by where 
I have only had 3 or 4 hours sleep, and I think to myself, 'You know, 
speed would really help out right now.' However, that is what makes me a 
more responsible user. I not only realize my desire for speed and other 
amphetamines and I curb the habit." He feels that his ability to control 
his habit is more powerful than his lust for it. "Many of my friends are 
long time users of speed. However, by no means have they ruined their 
lives."<P>
  DJ Velour believes that the rave community can co-exist with a drug 
like methamphetamine. He also, among others, mentions speed's many 
different appearances that make for different psychological outcomes. 
"Speed and other stimulants can be a positive part of a raving community. 
However, just like any other drug it depends upon the person taking it 
and the purity/mixture of the drug. As strange as this may sound, 
different speeds can evoke different emotions. They not only stimulate 
latent emotions, increasing their strength, but they can also enforce 
emotions much in the way ecstasy can. I have had some very "happy" speed 
that made me feel as happy as when I was on X. On the flip side I have 
had some lower grade speed that made me feel depressed."<P>

<P>
<I>  "Of all the separate realities, legal landscapes, and metabolic metropolis
that thrive beneath the surface of the Cleaver's USA, no subculture seems 
as pervasive or uniform as the nationwide-eyed, high dosage 
methamphetamine club.<P>
  This group is a tribute to the idea that some things stay the same 
across time or space... the members come and go, some leave quietly, some 
go snitch, croak, or disappear, some hang in there after their lights 
have gone out, and quite a few are dragged off at 6:00 a.m. Friday 
morning by blue windbreakers with yellow writing.<P>
  Getting in too deep is what we do, it's who we are.<P>
  But despite all this, there are a few of us who have managed to hang 
around the periphery for decades, avoiding the felonies, gunshots, big 
ripoffs, and crippling motorcycle accidents. Other than luck, the key to 
staying alive is knowing when to take a step back, on your own, and avoid 
the biggest bear-trap in the speed circus: taking yourself too 
seriously...<P>
  Truly not giving a fuck is the only way to maintain perspective. In 
other words, there are worse things that can happen, than having to lay 
down and go to sleep for a week... no drug or state of mind is worth 
dying for, killing for, or doing hard time for..." (Speed Phreak)</I><P>
<P>
  "My experience with speed-like substances really begins with coffee," 
says Mark, an addict that relates his experiences back to an early age. 
"I've been drinking the stuff since Jr. High School as my get me up and 
go thing. But the relationship with amphetamines starts six or seven 
years ago with poppers (ephedrine, mini-thins). I started taking them to 
stay awake in college to finish papers and the like."<P>
  "Things got really serious when I started doing CAT, a local low-grade 
speed that was in vogue about six years ago." CAT, or methacathinone, is 
a popular substance made from common household chemicals like 
drain-cleaner, Epsom salts and battery acid. "I realized how bad my 
problem was when right around the time the land war in Iraq began. I had 
stayed up for days on end, watching the planes bomb the Iraqis. It's the 
only drug I've done at work. To this day what was a six month period 
still seems to me to be several weeks. It's also the only drug I've done 
where my peers at work noticed mood swings, irritability, and 
sleeplessness. The CAT I knew dearly also tweaked me on methamphetamine 
when the CAT seemed to loose its luster." CAT is notorious for its 
hardcore addictive potential, apparently strong enough to hook users 
after just one sample.<P>
  "Even after I kicked the CAT habit, I would usually indulge my speed 
addiction by crushing up mini-thins and snorting them. This continued for 
about another year. Most recently (for about a year) I moved to MDMA as 
the speed kick. At first I did it about once a month, but that has fallen 
off to a much less frequent, but still regular usage."<P>
  "What caught me about speed, and what catches me now, is the feeling of 
invulnerability. I think I get from speed what most cocaine users get 
from coke. The feeling of being on top of the world. As a raver, speed is 
also a convenient way to keep dancing long after your body has gone to 
sleep."<P>
  Asked if the drug has improved his life, he answers, "What a joke. 
Improve? Beyond the nominal gain of being able to dance until the wee 
hours of the morning, it doesn't. And productivity? Any gains are 
ephemeral and short-lasted."<P>
  "I do in fact know some people who skate through life without problems 
with drugs. But I think more people than not overestimate their ability 
to handle drugs. Drugs can be fun, but they also tend to get in the way 
of being a functional human being with multi-dimensional interests, as 
opposed to being a full-time club kid, which gets you nowhere fast."<P>
  For "Pat," the drug poses a serious paradox. He was prescribed 
methamphetamine for a learning disability and consequently produced a 
problem through abuse. "I'm able to work with concentration on something 
far longer than a few hours," he says of meth. "I have Attention Deficit 
Disorder [and] speed seems to improve my attention span."<P>
  "It can be a transcendental drug if you do enough. I've had really 
intense thought about observations of myself, or new ideas about what I'd 
like to do with my music, or other creative thoughts. This occurs with 
other psychedelic drugs that I've done." Still, he describes the typical 
problem with drugs like speed. "Speed is funny. You think you've got it 
under control when you first do it because it's usually so nasty on the 
sinuses and your body that you don't ever think you could get used to the 
feeling... [However], you do."<P>
  Other users bring up the fact that MDMA also has an addiction factor, 
that many only attribute to meth. "I like speed just fine," says Benboy. 
"But I have seen many speed freaks go out like that. And I've seen a few 
'E' freaks buy the farm too, even though I do think E is much safer). But 
a drug, whether it's strychnine, THC, caffeine or Prozac, is nothing more 
than an inert substance; as dangerous as a head of lettuce in itself. 
It's what you do with it that makes a difference. But the difference 
between jonesing for a sugar fix and a speed fix is only partially 
chemical and physiological. Most of it is social." The drug itself is not 
the problem, it's the setting involved. The availability and the motive 
to remain awake for long hours may compound the addiction of speed.<P>
  Still others attribute a great deal of positive qualities to 
methamphetamine. "My brain was so clear when I used this, that I came up 
with answers to problems that had been bugging me for months," says an 
anonymous post to one of the world wide web's drug archives. "This stuff 
makes your brain work at 100% efficiency and doubles processor speed. It 
makes you feel (and probably actually does) like your IQ jumped quite a 
bit." According to some medical journals, methamphetamine does produce 
slight improvements in mental acuity, though performance of only "simple 
mental tasks" is improved, although the amount of errors is not 
necessarily decreased.<P>
  Still many would attribute "wonder drug" status to meth, enabling them 
to get more done without sleep. Students, hackers and late-night workers 
rely on the drug to keep them awake. "Sleep will never even occur to 
you," the post continues. "Do two hits in the morning before work, and 
you will never miss the sleep from the night before. As a matter of fact, 
you will feel better than if you had skipped the drug and slept all 
night!"<P>

<P>
<B>Speed was created for a future world where everything moves at a faster 
clip</B>, an unsettling velocity. Seemingly synthesized as an accessory to a 
fast car, high speed lifestyle, it has made mutations over the years to 
evolve for a new race. The punk, cyber, industrial and rave scenes has 
exemplified their fetish for speed. The desire for future frontiers -- 
high gloss veneers and space travel-- is not inhuman, but the problem 
comes with the human limitation to handle the extremes of rocket travel 
or the side-effects of re-entry. Like a space capsule falling to earth, 
the destruction that comes from the come-down can be severe.<P>
  The come-down is what many users refer to as "the crash." Usually 
symptoms like chills, nervous twitching, sweats and exhaustion are 
prevalent. The "high" produced is a result of extra activation chemicals 
in the brain. "The so-called stereotypic behavior in animals (compulsive 
gnawing, sniffing) is associated with dopamine release from reservoirs in 
neurons in the brain," says Matt Plunkett, an Organic Chemistry graduate 
student at U.C. Berkeley. "The increase in motor activity involves the 
noradrenaline system. [The drug] mimics the molecule noradrenaline 
(norepinephrine) at the receptors for this neurotransmitter. Hence your 
body acts as if there were more of it around."<P>
  Simply put, stimulants cause their effects by blocking re-uptake of 
neurotransmitters at a pre-synaptic membrane. The cell secretes 
activation chemicals, but cannot re-absorb them in the presence of 
cocaine or speed. The user feels "wired," full of energy, because their 
cells are receiving massive stimulation. The more concentrated the drug 
is, the more intense the rush is, and the more damaging the effects. In 
worst case scenarios, heart attacks occur from over stimulation and 
energy depletion.<P>
  The come down is a result of the chemical being released all at once, 
making you high, but then is subsequently degraded in the synapse. So 
once you come down, there's not as much as there normally should be, 
creating the "come-down blues."<P>
<P>
<B>Prevalent discussion between users on either side of the methamphetamine </B>
argument involves addiction. According to several studies, criteria for 
addiction includes: unsuccessful attempts to quit, persistent desire and 
craving, continued use despite knowledge of harm to oneself or others, 
taking the drug to avoid or relieve withdrawal. While the social 
definition for addiction is debatable, the chemical and physical activity 
in the body is founded in one of several compounds in the brain. "Many 
drugs that are addictive, have primary or major effects on the dopamine 
system (nicotine, amphetamine, cocaine, alcohol, heroine)," says 
Plunkett. "Drugs that don't have a major effect on dopamine generally 
aren't 'addictive' in the same way -- Marijuana, MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, 
etc. Although abuse potential is there, it doesn't generate the same kind 
of craving. Dopamine is normally involved with pleasure and reward, among 
many other biochemical roles."<P>
  With long-term abuse, the effects of methamphetamine become much more 
severe. Tolerance is an issue, like in most drugs, where more of the drug 
is needed to get "high." Psychosis, specific to methamphetamines usually 
sets in after a time which is said to include "suspicion, anxiety and 
auditory hallucination." Though reportedly, much more acute are the 
changes in lifestyle and eventually in personality that manifest. Users 
exhibit an affective disorder and subtle change in psychological
temperament. Apparently, these symptoms can last up to five years. Many 
who have witnessed the changes in habitual users report the shift to 
aggressive or non-affectionate behavior which may also be attributed to 
methamphetamine. Also apparent is some nerve damage in habitual users 
(primarily crystal smokers) -- jaw clenching and facial ticks.However, 
how much can be attributed tot the drug and how much to sleep deprivation 
is unclear. <P>
  Meth is one of the most addictive drugs of today's commonly used drugs. 
According to one study that appeared in <I>In Health</I> magazine (Dec. 1990), 
the addictive potential inherent in the drug, methamphetamine, taken 
nasally ranks over cocaine, caffeine and PCP (angel dust) in addictive 
qualities. MDMA, marijuana, psilocybin and LSD ranked at least 50 points 
lower than meth on a 100 point scale, nicotine being the highest above 
both crack and crystal meth. Talk of "addictive personalities" have 
recently been founded valid, involving individual physiology, psychology, 
social and economic pressures to suggest a person's vulnerability to drug 
dependency. Therefore, it does rely greatly on the person when talking 
about their potential for abuse. Still, many theorists contend that 
stimulants -- lumping in caffeine, nicotine and amphetamines -- by their 
nature are addictive and must be reconsidered by society.<P>
<P>
<B>Ethnobotanist, drug theorist and author Terence McKenna calls the 
"dominator" drugs</B> -- synthetic drugs that have been refined and 
concentrated, therefore losing their natural link to the planet and to 
human-kind. He equates them with the religious fundamentalism and beige 
fascism of the post-industrial, Western world -- the center for 
ego-dominator culture. McKenna considers the natural psychedelics, 
psilocybin and even LSD, to be more intuitive and based upon the natural 
human spirit.<P>
  "Dominator" drugs have been established and validated by "dominator 
culture," a culture interested in the mass consumerism of these 
legitimate substances -- sugar, nicotine, caffeine. He relates the 
emergence of drugs like methamphetamine back to the institutionalized 
abuse of these substances. "The history of commercial drug synergies -- 
the way in which one drug has been cynically encouraged and used to 
support the introduction of others -- over the past five hundred years is 
not easy to contemplate," he writes in his book <I>Food of the Gods</I>.<P>
  "The hypocrisy of dominator culture as it picks and chooses the truths 
and realities that it finds comfortable," he continues. Some drugs like 
alcohol and nicotine have long been legal and subsidized by dominator 
culture, however their qualitative separation from drugs like cocaine or 
speed is still unclear. "[These drugs] are still at the depths of drug 
depravity especially considering the violent or illegal acts that the 
craving may induce [because of their illegal status], however tobacco 
addicts (smokers) might kill for their fix too if they had to, but 
instead they simply walk out to a 7-Eleven and buy cigarettes."<P>
<P>
<B>While I am no proponent of speed or drug abuse,</B> I have become glaringly 
aware of the hypocrisy prevalent in mainstream and underground culture 
regarding the legitimation of certain drugs. When finger-pointing, it is 
important to remember the glass houses we all live in. Addiction is a 
problem, but the bigger problem is sweeping it into a closet, pretending 
it isn't real, pretending that our own addictions are more manageable.<P>
  Speed is a potentially dangerous substance. It can be used as a tool, 
like late-night coffee drinkers. It can also be used as a recreational 
drug. However, it can also be abused and exploited to the point where the 
need for it besides soothing a craving is the only point. And then, there 
is no point. Some may argue that there is an aesthetic, a qualitative 
high, however, by methamphetamine's nature -- as a refined, concentrated 
addictive substance -- it only perpetuates the cycle for needing more.<P>
  There is very little factual information about amphetamines and their 
dangers available to the lay person. Research on the subject, aside from 
medical journals, is virtually nill. There is however a great deal of 
dangerous propaganda -- hear-say, lies, rumors. Misinformation sometimes 
is more dangerous than no information and real answers are only found 
through communication.<P>
  Many other drugs have been part of the rave community over the years -- 
nitrous oxide, Special K (ketamine) and especially ecstasy (MDMA) but 
none have exhibited the burn-out or addiction rate associated with 
methamphetamine. While meth (or any drug) is an inert substance that we 
cannot attribute blame to, by its nature it has raised the question "Are 
we really built for speed?" It seems that the human body, while naturally 
resilient to much self-inflicted abuse, may not be a reliable container 
for the soul at high speeds. Methamphetamine may have the ability to 
chemically fuel the ride, physically it may just prove the limitations 
for human society.<P>
