                             WHY I WROTE THIS FAQ
                                       
   Hi! After reading sci.electronics for a couple of years, I've
   discovered that many people are interested in decoding DTMF-signals
   for various applications. A frequently asked question (FAQ) concerning
   this subject is: "What IC should I use in order to decode DTMF
   signals?"
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
                          SHORT INTRODUCTION TO DTMF
                                       
   DTMF means: Dual Tone Multiplexed Frequency, the tones you might have
   heard while pressing the keys on your telephone. Each key produces a
   slightly different signal, which is a mixture of two frequencies, i.e.
   pressing '1' will send a tone made of 1209 Hz and 697 Hz to the other
   end of the line.
   
   (From the Editor)
   
   Here's a more detailed explanation of what DTMF is:
   
   Q: What frequencies do touch tones use for which numbers?
   
   A: The touch tone system uses pairs of tones to represent the various
   keys. There is a "low tone" and a "high tone" associated with each
   button (0 through 9, plus * (star) and # (octothorpe or pound symbol).
   The low tones vary according to what horizontal row the tone button is
   in, while the high tones correspond to the vertical column of the tone
   button.
   
   The tones and assignments are as follows:
   

          1     2     3     A  :  697 Hz

          4     5     6     B  :  770 Hz
                                           (low tones)
          7     8     9     C  :  852 Hz

          *     0     #     D  :  941 Hz
        ----  ----  ----  ----
        1209  1336  1477  1633 Hz
               (high tones)

or:

          1209 Hz 1336 Hz 1477 Hz 1633 Hz

                   ABC     DEF
697 Hz      1       2       3       A

           GHI     JKL     MNO
770 Hz      4       5       6       B

           PRS     TUV     WXY
852 Hz      7       8       9       C

                   oper
941 Hz      *       0       #       D

or:

    1  697+1209
    2  697+1336
    3  697+1477
    4  770+1209
    5  770+1336
    6  770+1477
    7  852+1209
    8  852+1336
    9  852+1477
    0  941+1336
    *  941+1209
    #  941+1477
    A  697+1633
    B  770+1633
    C  852+1633
    D  941+1633

   
   When the 4 button is pressed, the 770 Hz and 1209 Hz tones are sent
   together. The telephone central office will then decode the number
   from this pair of tones.
   
   The tone frequencies were designed to avoid harmonics and other
   problems that could arise when two tones are sent and received.
   Accurate transmission from the phone and accurate decoding on the
   telephone company end are important. They may sound rather musical
   when dialed (and representations of many popular tunes are possible),
   but they are not intended to be so.
   
   The tones should all be +/- 1.5% of nominal. The high frequency tone
   should be at least as loud, and preferably louder than the low
   frequency. It may be as much as 4 db louder. This factor is referred
   to as "twist." If a Touchtone signal has +3db of twist, then the high
   frequency is 3 db louder than the low frequency. Negative twist is
   when the low frequency is louder.
   
   Q: What are the A, B, C and D touch tone keys used for?
   Why are they not found on touch tone phone sets?
   
   A: These are extensions to the standard touch-tones (0-9, *, #) which
   originated with the U.S. military's Autovon phone network. The
   original names of these keys were FO (Flash Override), F (Flash), I
   (Immediate), and P (Priority) which represented priority levels that
   could establish a phone connection with varying degrees of immediacy,
   killing other conversations on the network if necessary with FO being
   the greatest priority, down to P being of lesser priority. The tones
   are more commonly referred to as the A, B, C and D tones respectively,
   and all use a 1633 Hz as their high tone.
   
   Nowadays, these keys/tones are mainly used in special applications
   such as amateur radio repeaters for their signalling/control. Modems
   and touch tone circuits tend to include the A, B, C and D tones as
   well. These tones have not been used for general public service, and
   it would take years before these tones could be used in such things as
   customer information lines; such services would have to be compatible
   with the existing 12-button touch tone sets in any case.

                                DECODING DTMF
                                       
   There are many ways to detect and decode these DTMF tones. One idea
   could be an eight sharp-tuned filter combination with detection
   circuits. Needless to say, this is very impractical, considering the
   various ICs (Integrated Circuits or 'chips') made by different
   manufacturers all over the world.
   
   Most of these ICs do not require more than one (inexpensive) 3.58 MHz
   x-tal or resonator and the power circuitry. Usually the output is
   4-bit binary + 1 strobe.

   (From Arkady Horak-Systems)
   
   I spent about the last 14 months of my life working on an integrated
   DTMF receiver here at Motolora and I would like to have you add the
   part to the DTMF-list. The receiver is part of a 6805 8-bit
   microcontroller and is called the MC68HC05F5. Here is a quick feature
   list:
   
     * MC68HC05 based core micro
     * Memory mapped I/O registers
     * 5632 bytes of user ROM
     * 224 bytes of RAM
     * 15-bit multi-function timer
     * Power saving STOP, WAIT and Data-Retention modes
     * Mask optional COP (computer operating properly) or watchdog timer
     * Self check ROM
     * Fully static operation with no minimum clock speed
     * 30 bidirectional I/O pins
     * On chip oscillator for use with external crystal or ceramic
       resonator 2 or 4 MHz operation only while DTMF rec. is functioning
     * DTMF receiver
     * 40 pin plastic dip or 44 pin plastic leaded chip carrier packages
       
   Being an avid electronics hobbyist I feel this part will see a lot of
   service in hobby applications. This part is, to the best of my
   knowledge the first general purpose microcontroller with an integrated
   DTMF receiver. Currently only a ROM based version is available but as
   sales grow a 705 or EPROM version may be manufactured. Also, this part
   is compatible with the 6805 development tools and software.

   Another way to decode/produce DTMF signals is by applying a DSP, a
   Digital Signal Processor. Practical examples of such an approach can
   be found in the TMS320 BBS, which is currently being mirrored at
   ftp://ti.com/mirrors/tms320bbs/. You may also wish to see the whole

   (From the Editor)
   
   If you are designing a device that will attach to the phone line and
   you are situates in USA, you will need to make the FCC happy. You can
   either do this by submitting your completed circuit to them for
   compliance testing (which can run a few thou$and) or you can purchase
   a small device that is preapproved by the FCC. It is called DAA for
   Data Access Arrangement. It is a small, usually potted, module that
   isolates (literally) your circuit from the phone line.
   
   The FCC section you are trying to satisfy is part 68. You should visit
   your local library and read up on it whether your get the preapproved
   part or try to have the FCC [affiliated lab] do the testing .. or just
   plain hope you don't get caught. It's pretty dry reading but that's
   life.
   
   There are several different modules on the market that fit into this
   category. They are:

       "The chip plugs into phone lines, splits the signal between input
       and output, has pins for ringing, off-hook, etc. The chip has
       FCC-transferable Part 68 registration, so it's 100% legal to
       connect whatever you want to it. There's an international version
       that should work down there in Oz."
       
       Someone was obviously not too happy using Cermetek parts. This is
       included here NOT because I'm biased but as a general precaution
       to designers. These things inherenly impose regulations. Need I
       say more?.. he writes:
       
       I once worked on a telephone-interface project with the
       unfortunate selection of the Cermetek parts. They were originally
       chosen for their small size and supposed FCC ease, but it turns
       out that a DDA interface from discrete parts was much cheaper and
       much better quality.
       
       Cermetek problems:
       
          + They have HORRIBLE noise problems. I don't know why, but they
            seemed to pick up every electric field in the machine and
            amplify it to obnoxious levels. Probably something to do with
            their "solid-state" transformer.
          + The "Pre-FCC-approved" parts have to include a "squelch"
            circuit to comply with FCC maximum level limitations. The FCC
            specifies the maximum as some number of dB over a one second
            period. Well, the squelch circuit does not take time into
            account, so it clips any loud transient sound. This
            frequently clips normal-level voice signals, and causes a
            real problem when speaking loudly.
          + The "pre-FCC-approved" part is also pretty big, about 1"x2",
            if I remember. With modern parts, a good circuit can fit in
            the same space.
          + The FCC approval was just as hard with the part as without.
            We had to include MOVs and other stuff between the Cermetek
            and the phone line, and still go through all the testing
            required of a discrete circuit.
          + Since they're epoxy-potted modules, they can't be fixed, and
            we had a serious problem with broken parts. Almost one in
            three was unusable.
          + The sidetone level (audio loopback) was much to high. It was
            OK once the speaker on the Cermetek end became used to it,
            but it bothered new users and would probably make data
            transmission difficult.
   
       So, if you have the time and the need, invest the effort to build
       a decent interface from parts. If you just need one for hobbyist
       needs, the Cermetek might work, but I got better performance from
       a phone interface ripped from a 1200 baud modem.
       
       There are just my experiences, and they were with early-rev parts,
       so they may have improved. Still, it would have saved us several
       months of engineering time if we had avoided Cermetek from the
       start.

                         CONCLUSION/ABOUT THE AUTHOR
                                       
   Well, that's the latest I've found on DTMF receivers. There are no
   doubt other companies producing these kind of chips, so please let me
   know and I'll improve this list (when I've got the time)
   
   Unfortunately, I'm not that experienced yet to answer any difficult
   technical questions about this subject.
   
   For suggestions, improvements, info, flames, waterbuckets (?) please
   e-mail me at: tsjoit@solist.htsa.hva.nl.
   
   I graduated July 1st 1994, so I won't continue writing updates for
   this faq (no time, no space, no money :)
   
   I like to thank all of you who think this faq was usefull, especially
   the ones who wrote me e-mail . I was very suprised to see this faq
   appear in the most strange places on the Net :)
   
   Anyway...have fun with those di-du-dit-di-duh tones :)
