<a name="MAILORDER_002"><h1> 2) Introduction </h1></a>

Here is my list of companies which will sell electronic components in
small quantities.  Many of these places I have bought from, several
I haven't.  Being a ham radio operator, I am most interested in
RF components, and in particular, air variable capacitors, which tend to be
scarce (and tend to be used or surplus even if I've otherwise labelled the
seller as &quot;NEW&quot;).<p>

Categories are:<p>

<dl>
<dt>NEW COMPONENTS
<dd>Distributors and sellers of new components, or &quot;new and some
	used&quot; in a couple of cases.
<dt>SURPLUS ELECTRONICS
<dd>Usually overstocks, occasionally used equipment.
	Ideal for stocking the junkbox, usually have dependable stock lines
	of resistors, capacitors, and some semiconductors, but won't have
	those LCD modules forever...  An invaluable resource, don't shy away
	from them.
<dt>SPECIALTY COMPONENTS
<dd>In particular, crystals and toroidal cores.
<dt>KITS
<dd>Ham radio kits, random electronic kits, whatever they have.
<dt>LITTLE GUYS
<dd>Separated out because of some twisted sentimentality,
	I suppose.  Intended to honor one or two ham spare-bedroom
	operations.  Note that sending $1 along with catalog requests
	is a big help for these folks.
<dt>PUBLICATIONS
<dd>A small selection of publications dealing with electronics,
	especially RF electronics.
<dt>QRP CLUB PUBLICATIONS
<dd>Clubs for low-power amateur radio enthusiasts;
	frequently have publications with quite a bit of technical content
	(which is why I'm a member of QRP clubs headquartered thousands
	of miles from where I live :-).  Note, this is generally practical
	technical content (how to build it) rather than theoretical technical
	content (why it works), but definitely more than Contester's Quarterly.

<pre>
Digi-Key
701 Brooks Ave. South
P.O.Box 677
Thief River Falls, MN 56701-0677
+1-800-DIGI-KEY (344-4539)
+1-218-681-3380 (FAX)
</pre><p>

No minimum, $5 handling under $25, free and very complete catalog, very nice
indeed.  Prices aren't always the best, but rarely excessive.  Weak on RF
specialty parts (though they now have the ever-popular NE602AN), but they do
have blue LEDs. <p>

<hr>

<a name="MAILORDER_005"><h2> 3.2) Mouser Electronics </h2></a>

Mouser Electronics

Catalog Subscriptions:	(800) 992-9943 (Continental US only)
Sales &amp; Service:	(800-34-MOUSER 
                        (800-346-6873) (US, Puerto R., Canada)
</pre><p>

Very complete catalog of brand-new components (though no air variables).
Usually quick service, $20 &quot;minimum&quot; ($5 charge under $20).  When ordering,
you may want to be sure to ask about availability and shipping locations;
they have several warehouses, and frequently orders will get sent from several
warehouses (which drives up the shipping costs).  Export orders have a $100
minimum, except for Canada and Mexico. <p>

<hr>

<a name="MAILORDER_006"><h2> 3.3) Ocean State Electronics </h2></a>

<pre>
Ocean State Electronics
P.O. Box 1458
Westerly RI 02891
+1-800-866-6626 (orders)
+1-401-596-3080
+1-401-596-3590 (FAX)
</pre><p>

Minimum $5, S&amp;H $4, $2 for catalog.  Wide array of RF parts, especially
air variables and B&amp;W coils.  Reportedly getting a bit slow filling orders. <p>

<hr>

<a name="MAILORDER_007"><h2> 3.4) Radiokit </h2></a>

<pre>
Radiokit		(store is located at:)
P.O.Box 973		169 Jeremy Hill Rd.
Pelham NH 03076		Pelham NH 03076
+1-603-635-2235
+1-603-635-2943 (FAX)
</pre><p>

No minimum ($3 service charge if under $20), many kits, lots of J. W. Miller
chokes &amp; coils, B&amp;W coils, RF switches, Millen variable capacitors, lots of
parts in general.  As of 24-Feb-94, they are again STILL out of catalogs,
and just barely might have one by Dayton this year.  They do accept mail
orders, but you'll have to call for prices and availability.  A classified ad
in 3/94 QST says &quot;Call/SASE&quot;, I guess they may have fliers. <p>

<hr>

<a name="MAILORDER_008"><h2> 3.5) Circuit Specialists Inc </h2></a>

<pre>
Circuit Specialists Inc
P. O. Box 3047
Scottsdale AZ 85271-3047
+1-800-528-1417
</pre><p>

No minimum with check or money order, $15 otherwise.  $3 S&amp;H.
New electronics, good RF assortment, increasing infestation of computers. <p>

<hr>

<a name="MAILORDER_009"><h2> 3.6) Active Electronics </h2></a>

<pre>
Active Electronics
11 Cummings Park		237 Hymus Blvd
Woburn MA 01801			Pointe Claire, Quebec, H9R 5C7
+1-800-677-8899 (Main number for US and Canada)
+1-514-630-7410 (International)
+1-514-697-8112 (FAX)
</pre><p>

$25 minimum, $5 S&amp;H UPS, catalog has a &quot;$10 Suggested retail price&quot; but they
sent mine for free.  They have 7(?) stores in the US (Chicago IL;
Baltimore MD; Woburn MA; Detroit MI; Mt. Laurel NJ; Long Island NY; Seattle WA)
and 10 stores in Canada (Quebec City; Montreal (2); Ottawa; Mississuaga;
Winnipeg; Calgary; Toronto; Edmonton; Vancouver BC).  Each store has its own
800 number and FAX number, call the main number(s).  International orders are
to be mailed to the Canadian address, but they want payment in US funds!
Lots of stuff, oriented more toward supplying last-minute requirements of
companies than hobbyists, but perfectly happy to take your money in small
doses (stores have no minimum order).  The $25 minimum for certain items is
no longer explicit, but they note that some items will &quot;ship in factory
minimum package quantities&quot;, which might be worse. <p>

<a name="MAILORDER_010"><h2> 3.7) Maplin Electronics Ltd </h2></a>

</pre><p>

&quot;Over here [in the United Kingdom] the main hobbyist electronics supplier is
Maplin Electronics who stock a wide variety of equipment.  They have a
catalogue which can be shipped for 10.65 pounds sterling by air or 5.50 pounds
sterling by surface mail. They accept Mastercard, American Express and
International Reply Coupons. They have at least one type of air-filled
variable capacitor!&quot;  (Thanks to Kev White at Cambridge University). <p>

<a name="MAILORDER_011"><h2> 3.8) Newark Electronics </h2></a>

 Chicago IL 60640-4496
 +1-312-784-5100
</pre><p>

They don't have a single mail address or phone; instead, one is supposed
to call the closest of three pages worth of branch offices.  I don't feel
like typing in the entire list (it's copyrighted, anyway :-), so send email
for your &quot;local&quot; distributor, or call their administrative offices at the
number above.  They have a $25 minimum order; they are a Real Distributor,
but accept small orders (over the minimum, of course).  Their catalog
currently 1488 pages; they are very complete (except, of course, for my
favorite scarce item, the air-variable capacitor).  Note that the catalog
prices tend not to match reality all that often, so order by phone rather
than by mail; prices tend to be higher than other places, but they have a lot
of things that are hard to find from other outlets.  Also note that they have
six Canadian offices, and one UK office, and will take international orders
at 500 N. Pulaski St., Chicago IL 60624-1019, +1-312-784-5100
(FAX +1-312-638-7652, TLX 6718690 NEWARK U). <p>

Minimum $25; <b>they no longer have a catalog</b>.  They are a Real Distributor,

Minimum $20 ($25 for charge cards, and they don't take personal checks),
handling $1.95 + shipping.  Oriented toward repair technicians, really
heavy on VCR parts and somewhat overpriced doodads, lots of useful stuff
not easily found elsewhere. <p>

Lots of stuff for the practical enthusiast.  Many bargains to be had if
you've the patience to sort through the extensive heaps of assorted
electronic miscellany.  Good stocks of new components, tools and books,
masses of RF gear and very competetive prices.<p>
Two shops side by side cater for the &quot;consumer&quot; type goods and the
&quot;electronics&quot; type.  Does mail order, takes visa/access etc.  Mail order
list contains lots of unusual goodies that you'll possibly never see on
offer anywhere else.<br>

Possibly the busiest electronics emporium I've ever visited.  Specialises in
radio gear and alarm equipment but many of the obligatory bags of &quot;unmarked,
untested&quot; goodies makes Bardwell's *the* place to go.  Friendly, efficient
and knowledgeable staff.  Cheap.  Very cheap.  Thriving mail order business
with some good bargains in IC's and discrete's.  Write/phone for a price

&quot;I have a small (just me) mail order company through which I sell kits.
My starter products were kits for computer&lt;-&gt;transceiver interfaces to go
along with my 2/93 QST article.  Since, I have added a programmer kit for
the MC68HC705K1 microcontroller and an optoisolated stepper motor controller
kit.  I also sell the PCBs and difficult parts for these projects.&quot;<br>
