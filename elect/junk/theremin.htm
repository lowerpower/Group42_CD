Connections to the collectors of Q2,3 are made via 5 way binding posts.
Antennas are Lafayette F343 whips.
Keep leads short. Cut shield connectors off 2N1264's. Place near AM radio
Adjust 200pf cap at J1 until hissing noise, then 200pf at J2 for whistle,
then back to 200pf at J2 for lowest pitch. Play with hands. Perhaps an
ascii artist can draw from the description. Good luck.
