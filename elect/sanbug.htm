<h2>Audio Serveilance</h2>
<h4>By Unknown, HTML'ed by Group42</h4>
</center>
   Audio is the most common surveilance method in use.  Most listening devices
depend on some form of electronics, and it is important to understand the usual
steps to audio electronic surveillance.  It is basically a 5 step process. 
<ul>

<li>1) Input- usually a microphone
<li>2) Preamplifier- used to boost the nominal signal of a mic to usable levels
<li>3) Processing- eliminates excess noise and unwanted sounds from the output
<li>4) Output- headphones, recorder, transmitter, etc.
<li>5) Post-processing (sometimes)
</ul>

<h3>Microphones</h3>

   This phile will deal with microphones.  Other files will deal with each of the
other steps. Microphones are judged by frequency response, sensitivity, 
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), durability, and size. Frequency response is the range
of sound that will give usable output from the mic.  Human hearing is roughly 
20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, but, in surveillance work, we only need to hear the frequencies
that deal with human speech. 
<p>
   Sensitivity is the amount of electrical output we get for a given sound level.
surveillance mics need to be very sensitive to pick up the whisper or speech from
a distant room, so we look for the most sensitive mic that performs well in the 
other areas. 
<p>
   Signal-to-noise ratio is the number of decibels (dB) louder than the mic's
noise the input signal is.  All mics introduce hissing, cracking electrical noise
into the output.  A good compact disc player can have a S/N ratio of 90 dB, totally 
inaudible to humans.  Records give a S/N ratio of 50-60 dB, which gives some noise
during quiet passages, but a good record on a good player will have very little
audible noise except during quiet parts.  50 dB is usually considered VERY good
for surveillance gear.  Condenser mics give a less-than-extraordinary 35-43 dB S/N
ratio.  All electrical equipment add noise to the signal.  Each stage introduces
more noise, so, while the noise introduced by the mic might be almost unnoticable,
when added to the inevitable noise of the other components, it can become quite
annoying. 
<p>
    Impedance is the opposition to alternate current.  This is only important
because a transformer is needed to couple a mic and amp if they have different
impedences.  Mics are classified either high impedance or low impedance.  High 
impedance mics tend to lose some of their high frequency response in long runs of
cable.  Low impedance mics are usually between 50 and 600 ohms.  High impedance
mics are in the 5000 to 20,000 ohm range. Some mics come with built in transformers
that are switchable to make them high or low impedance, but these add bulk and 
noise to the mic, and a better transformer can be built into the preamplifier. 
It is imperative in surveillance that we match the mic impedance with interfacing
machinery, or a loss of signal and lower S/N ratio may occur. 
<p>
   Durability is the mic's ability to stand up to changes in humidity and temperature,
as well as it's ability to withstand shock.  Dynamic and electret mics are generally
the most durable. 
<p>
   Size is very important in surveillance work.  As a rule of thumb, a small mic is
always preferable because it can go unnoticed more easily than a large one, but
sometimes a large mic can be incorporated well into the environment (A large 
dynamic mic can be installed in a stereo speaker system and blend perfectly with
the speakers inside. 
<p>
  There are several types of mics, but only a few are suitable for surveillance
work.  The most common are crystal, condenser, dynamic, and electret. 
   Crystal mics are microphones that use a crystal of Rochelle salt as it's
piezoelectric element.  Piezoelectricity is the property of acquiring opposite
electrical charges on opposing faces of assymetrical crystals when they are 
subjected to pressure.  It is closely related to the ceramic mic, which uses barium
titanate instead of Rochelle salt.  The ceramic mic is more weather resistant and
has slightly lower impedance.  Condenser mics have replaced crystal mics in most 
applications, but their high output and high impedance and low cost still find use
in some applications.  they find use in surveillance mainly in contact mics (such 
as spike mics) where a probe is linked directly to the crystal. 
<p>
   Condenser mics are one of the favorites for clandestine work.  They are very
small, offfer wide, smooth frequency response, and are fairly inexpensive. 
Condenser mics have to membranes, and the change in distance (which causes a change
in capacitance) between them causes the electrical output.  One or both of the 
charged membranes is flimsy, and sound alters the distance between them.  They have
built a built in ampifier which changes the variable capacitance to variable voltage
or current, and it also drops the impedance from millions of ohms to 500-2000 ohms.
It requires a power supply, usually either an internal battery or, more commonly,
the mic draws power from it's output leads (often called phantom power). Frequency
response is very good.  For most surveillance work, it is too good, because it 
reaches down below the range of human voice.  The high end extends above the normal
voice levels (some sopranos can reach the high end, though.) 
<p>
   Dynamic mics are basically speakers designed to work in reverse-instead of
changing electrical signals into sound, they change sound into electrical signals.  They are durable, low impedance, and very large when compared to 
electret mics that are a fraction of the size of a dime.  They often pick up a 60
Hz AC hum unless shielded.  These perform poorly in surveillance work.  Electret
mics are without a doubt the best all-around surveillance mics.  They work similarly
to condenser mics, but require less power because they have a permanent charge 
across their membranes.  Condenser mics use their input voltage to create a charge
across the membranes. 
<p>
   There are other mics which just aren't cut out for surveillance work except in
most unusual circumstances.  The large ribbon mics used in recording studios are
too expensive and fragile for surveillance work, along with giving much to wide a 
frequency response.  Carbon mics used to be used in telephone mouthpieces, but that
is fairly unusual now.  They are large and give mediocre resaponse.  If you ever
watched mission impossible or any old spy films, you may have seen the hero unscrew
the mouthpiece of a phone and take out the mic and drop in his special transmitter.
It was called the drop in transmitter, and could be inserted in any "standard"
phone and transmit the conversations over short distances.  Pressure zone mics are
perhaps the best of the uncommon mics.  They are not really a mic, but a design,
because they can have an electret, condenser, dynamic, etc. element in them. 
Pressure zone mics have a boundry about 1/32" in front of the mic.  This results in 
the arrival of direct and reflected sound in a way that cancels echos.  It enhances
intelligability, but is very large.  The smallest of them will fit into a shirt
pocket, andthey are very expensive and fragile.  Still, there are situations where
they fit the bill better than any other mic.

<h3>Preamplification</h3>
 
   This phile will deal with preamplification.  Preamplifiers boost the signal
from the input to a usable level.  Most microphones and sensors, such as 
phototransistors in light transmission bugs, give a signal that lacks power to
do anything useful.  The electricity generated by the needle of a record player
can't drive the speakers of your stereo system. 
<p>
   The main factors of preamplification are gain and noise.  Gain is the increase
in signal given by the preamplifier.  Noise is unwanted sound that the preamp
generates.  A good preamp can make up for a mediocre mic or a bad signal due to
the location of the target with relation to he mic, but nothing can compensate for
a bad preamp.  A good preamp has high gain and low noise.  There is no limit to
the amount of gain that can be applied, but noise and electrical breakdown limit
the practical application of it.  Noise increases with gain, so the limit is where
noise overwhelmes the signal. Electrical breakdown occurs when gain is so high that
inaudible ultrasonic feedback causd by the location of the components with relation
to each other causes the preamp to shut down.  Electrical breakdown also occurs
when gain is so high that oscillation occurs and a squeal is sent through the
mic or speaker.  That can sometimes be lessened by shielding or changing the
location of the mic. 
<p>
   Operational amplifiers (op Amps) are often used because they are inexpensive,
simple to use, easier to handle, and offer higher gain and lower noise than 
normal-component amplifiers.  Op Amps are integrated circuits (ICs) that were 
originally developed for use in analog computers in the 1940s.  They are high
performance linear amplifiers with 2 inputs, allowing for inverted and non-inverted
output (negative and positive gain).  The gain is determined by a resistor that
feeds some of the amplified signal back to teh inverting input.  The smaller the
resistor, the lower the gain. An Op Amp amplifies the difference between the input
and ground.  This may seem complicated, but it actually makes amplifier design 
much simpler. Even a novice could design a simple amplifier using only the 
Op-amp's data sheet.  It is important to keep the battery leads short, but most
amps avoid that restriction by using a capacitor to keep the input from 
oscillating.  Op Amps are the components that make miniature bugs posible.

<h3>Signal Processing</h3>
   This phile deals with signal processing [steps 3 (processing) and 5 (post 
processing)].  Signal processing gets rid of as much unwanted noise as possible,
while retaining and boosting human speech.  Ideally, processing is done as the 
audio leaves the preamp, but that is not always possible due to size restrictions
and personel availability, so we sometimes record the audio and process it later,
but call it post-processing.  Processing can be divided into 3 parts; speech
passband, compression, and equalization. 
<p>
   The first step to processing is the removal of sounds outside the speech band.
This makes the rest of the processing go more smoothly because the sounds that
are unwanted anyway aren't dealt with.  The speech passband goes from 300-3000 Hz.
By eliminating the sounds outside this range, we cut the unwanted noise
considerably.  Filters that eliminate the sounds above and below are very easy to
build (an Op Amp and a few resistors and capacitors can be thrown together to make
a passable filter), but, for surveillance, we sometimes make complex filters with
high dB/octave slopes. 
<p>
  Slope measures how quickly response drops below nominative level (3 dB below
input level).  Steepness is expressed in dB/octave, which occurs in multiples of 6.
A 36 dB/octave filter eliminates all sound below about 150 hz, and sound above
that is practically inaudible up to almost 300 Hz.  A 6 dB/octave filter would
dampen the sounds, but they would be audible down to around 100 db, and still
noticable down to around 50dB.  The high end filters work the same way, only
response is lower for higher signals instead of lower ones.  A 24 dB slope at
each end of the passband is a fair negotiation, and, to make design simpler, we
could drop it to 18 dB/octave but raise the low end to 500 Hz and drop the high
end to 2000 Hz and not miss much.  A filter below 18 dB/octave is almost a waste
of time because the filter would barely dampen the sounds that need to be removed.
<p>
   The next step is compression.  It would be unessacary if the target would stand
in one place and speak in a clear, medium voice.  Unfortunately, if you ask 
someone to do this, they might get a teeny bit suspicious.  We all have the 
tendancy to speak at various levels, from a whisper to a shout, and everyone tends
to move around and change the direction that they're facing when they are speaking.
In a surveillance recording, we want to hear whispers as if they had been spoken
aloud, and we want to hear shouts at the level of a normal voice.  That's where
a compressor comes into play.  It raises the level of a low sound, and lowers
that of a loud one.  With a compressor made from an IC compander, a -80 dB signal
is boosted to -40, and a +20 signal is cut to +10.  The chip I use is capable of
double compression, which means that a -80 dB signal is boosted to -20 and a 
+20 signal is cut to +5.  It is possible to use 2 compressors together to bring
the range within 6.25 dB of each other, but that is really unnecessary and causes
the component to be bulkier than it should be.  A limiter can be used with or
(shudder) instead of a compressor.  A limiter suppresses signals above certain
levels, so your recorder or ears won't be overloaded.  The last step of signal
processing is equalization.  Equalization is the process of removing sounds within
the speech passband that can be as annoying as those outside it.  For example, if
you are listening with a laser bug, your speech passband will remove 90% of the
noise, and the compressor will make all the sounds audible without battering your
eardrums, but the mark has a refrigarator next to the window you are useing as a
reflector that is obscuring some of the sound.  So you need to get rid of the
narrow band that the refrigarator is on without obscuring the voices.  A 
parametric equalizer can do the job.  This is not the same as a "graphic"
equalizer that you can find on a stereo system, although that can substitute 
if necessary.  The graphic equalizer has set center frequencies and bandwidths,
usually at octave points.  If the sound you want to eliminate is between 2
frequencies, you have to adjust both and sacrafice some of the speech.  A 
parametric lets you set the center frequency and bandwidth.  A good parametric
should operate from about 200 Hz to 4000 Hz.  Anything below or above will be
filtered by the passband filters.  (from 200-300Hz and 3000-4000Hz will be damped,
but not eliminated)   A parametric equalizer with 3 bands can run rings around
a graphic equalizer in the same range with 30 bands.  You can also use a
parametric to boost the high frequency sibilants to make speech more clear.

<h3>Output</h3>
 
   This is the last phile in this series.  It deals with the output, and what
you should do with it.  We can, and usually do monitor in realtime, but most
intelligence work is recorded for later review.  Small tape recorders introduce
a LOT of noise, and don't have very long playing times.  Open reel recorders
correct this, but high fidelity VHS have longer recording times and better 
frequency response.  A T-160 tape in extended play records for more than 8 hours.
In addition, if the mark is under video surveillance, that can be recorded 
simultaniously.  Pulse Code Modulation is a true digital format with better
dropout compensation than VHS, and they can input to a video recorder.  Digital
Audio Tape also exists, and an encoder could be used easily to make your tapes
useless to anyone who confinscated them.  Solid state digital recorders have 
applications as well.  Currently, the limitations are in memory only, but,
with 1 megabit chips and 4 megabit chips coming into play, long play is possible.
There is a device called  "Memo-me" that records 32 seconds of low resolution 
sound on 512K.  The recording time could be doubled or quadrupled without 
suffering much loss, and a high-memory device could be used to record for hours. 
Digital tape and solid state digital recording equipment is still quite a bit 
out of the budget of the average hobbyist, and VHS gives sufficient quality.  
Someday, however, the average spook will be able to feed a bad recording with 
unintelligable speech through his digital processor and get crystal clear sound
out of it.  For now, however, open reel tape offers about the best quality for the
price, though most people do own a video recorder...
