If you your name is up there, and you didn't know you contributed, it 
probably is because I have saved an interesting post from alt.beer.
Thanks!

This list is divided into several sections, each addressing a bit 
different aspect of beer. The topic is as broad as there are tastes for
different kinds of beer.  Due to this, this FAQ list cannot possibly 
cover every aspect of the subject. It is only meant as an overview 
that answers a few of the multitude of "Frequently Asked Questions"

Cheers!

I. Drinking Beer

What kinds of beers are there?

What are Ales and Lagers, etc, types and styles.

What are ales? Ales are generally beers made with top fermenting yeasts
        They are brewed at "warm" temperatures, normally between 50 and
        70 degrees Fahrenheit.

What are lagers? Lagers are generally beers made with bottom Fermenting
        yeasts. They are fermented at cooler temperatures, generally 35 to 
        50 degrees Fahrenheit. These cooler temperatures mean longer
        fermenting. The process of fermenting at cool temperatures is called
        "lagering." 

        Lagers are said to have originated in Germany where the brewers
        found that they could change the flavor and smoothness of their
        beers by storing them in cold caves. 

        Pilsners (most American beers) are a subset of lagers.
        The style originated in Pilsen Chezkoslovakia, and the definitive
        beer of this style is Pilsner Urquel. 
        
        Another type of lager is a "Bock" beer. A bock is typically a
        lager made with a bit more of everything, and is somewhat 
        stronger. Mai-Bock's are a subset of that style that are brewed
        in the early spring time (Mai is German for May). 

What are lambics? Lambics are specifically Belgian beers, made in a
        certain part of Belgium, specifically in Payottenland east of
        Brussels in the Zenne valley.  The beer may well be named for
        the Payottenland town of Lembeek. 

        Lambics are fermented using wild, air born yeasts. Brewers often
        have their primary fermenting vessels on the top floor of the
        brewery so that they can open holes in their roofs to let the
        yeasts, rain, dust, bugs, and whatever else into their beer. 

        Lambics have a very distinctive taste, and are often flavored
        fruit. Whole fruit is often added to the beer causing a secondary
        fermentation. These beers can range in taste from fairly sweet to
        very vinegary and sour. Often considered to be something of an
        acquired taste. 

What are the government  classifications?

What is malt liquor? In the United States, Malt liquor is a classification
        bestowed on beers that are above a certain alcohol content. The
        laws vary from state to state in the US. Many beers have been
        given the title malt liquor, even though that is not their true
        type. 

What do 3.2 and 5.0% mean? This is a "rating" of the amount of alcohol in
        the beer, by volume or by weight depending on where you are.

What is Reinheitsgebot? It is an old German "purity" law that delineates
        the ingredients that can be used to make beer. Under this law, there
        are only four; water, barley malt, hops, and yeast.
        
        "Rein" means clean or pure; "-heit" means "-ness"; so "Reinheit"
        means "cleanliness" or "purity".

What do the terms used in beer commercials mean?

What is "Dry" beer? Dry beer is beer that has less malt, and more corn
        or rice sugars added to it during the brewing process. This 
        produces a lighter, slightly more alcoholic, "dryer" tasting beer.
        It also probably reduces the brewing costs. The style is said
        to have originated in Japan.

What is "Cold Filtered?" Cold filtering is beer that is physically filtered
        after it has been brewed, before it is bottled. This tends to 
        eliminate all sediments (yeast and malt leftovers... things that
        can give beer character), and makes the beer clear. 

What does "Heat Pasteurized" mean? It means the beer has been heated after
        fermenting, killing all of the remaining live yeasts and any other 
        microganisms. It means that the beer will not continue to age in 
        its bottle.

What does "bottle conditioned" mean? It is beer that has not been
        pasteurized, and still has live yeast in it. It will continue to
        age in the bottle, and the character of the beer will change over 
        time. For some kinds of beer this is good, for others it means
        they will spoil after a while.

What is "draught" (draft) beer? It is beer that has been drawn or pulled
        from a cask. Beer from pressurized kegs is often referred to as
        draft beer, but this is probably a misnomer, or an "Americanism" 

What is ice beer/ eisbock? Whats the difference? Ice beer is beer that has
        reportedly been fermented a nearly freezing temperatures. This is
        another ploy by Megabrewies to convince people that their beer is
        something different or better than everyone elses. Ice Beers are
        basically another style of light American lagers. 
        
        True eisebock's are beers that have been frozen after they are
        fermented to raise the specific gravity and alcohol content of
        the beer. The water in the beer turns to ice when the beer gets
        cold enough. The ice crystals are strained or filtered out, leaving
        a beer with a higher specific gravity and generally a higher 
        alcohol content. 

How can you get draft beer in a can or bottle??? 
        Unknown.
                                
Where can I get beer? Breweries, brewpubs, stores, restaurants,
        distributors, and by making your own. 

What is a brewpub? It is a combination of brewery, pub, and maybe 
        restaurant. There are LOTS of these in Europe, and are getting
        to be more in America.

Can I get beer in the mail?
        Yes...  Beer Across America's phone numbr is 1-800-854-2337,
        and Microbrew to You is reportely now out of business.

How do I make my own beer?? See below.

How do I judge a beer or what is good beer?

Good beer (what is it, and how to tell). Good beer is determined by an
        individuals tastes. It has been suggested that trying a wide variety
        of beers will usually help a person figure out what beer tastes good.

What makes beer go bad? (what it is and why it is bad/skunked.) Bad beer
        is beer that tastes bad of is spoiled. Beer can and will spoil
        under certain conditions. Mishandling and old age are the two
        biggest causes of spoiled beer. Skunked beer refers to beer that
        has been lightstruck, causing the hops to take on a skunky odor.
        This is often happens with clear or green bottles, and tends to
        be prevalent in certain imported beers.

What are some good books on beer?


        Michael Jackson's Beer Companion does not give ratings.  It
        discusses various styles and profiles good examples of the
        the styles.  This is a very enjoyable book that every beer
        lover should have.

        The Simon & Schuster Pocket Guide to Beer (ISBN 0-671-72915-2)
        by Michael Jackson is the book commonly referred to in these
        groups when citing ratings on MJ's four-star system.  About 1300
        beers from around the world are reviewed and rated. New version
        due out in late 1994, according to Jackson.

        Stephen Beaumont's Great Canadian Beer Guide (Macmillan Canada,
        ISBN 0-7715-9031-8).  Steve also uses the MJ four-star system.
        This is a must for anybody that appreciates Canadian Beers.

        Jamie MacKinnon's Ontario Beer Guide.  (don't have publishing
        information.  It has a good section on tasting and evaluating
        beers, although I (Alan M.) disagree with his overattention to
        appearance factors.  He rates all the beers in Ontario (as
        of 1991, I think) on a five star scale.

        Fred Eckhardt's The Essentials of Beer Style (ISBN 0-9606302-7-9). 
        The editor of the book is Jeff Frane, who many will recognize
        from the beer groups, especially rec.crafts.brewing. A book that
        does not rate beers, but does have a lot of technical information
        about various beers as well as information about tasting.

II. Making Beer

WHERE DO I START... How do I make beer? Beer is made with 
        basically, water, barley malt, hops and yeast. The water, malt 
        and hops are boiled to produce a wort. This wort is cooled, put
        into a fermenting vessel, and the yeast is added (pitched). This
        vessel is sealed with an air lock, and the beer is allowed to
        ferment (sugar and water is turned to alcohol, carbon dioxide, etc)
        and age for a period of time. When the fermentation is over, a
        bit of additional malt or other sugar is added (for carbonation),
        and the beer is bottled or kegged. It is once again allowed to age
        for a period of time, during which the additional sugars carbonate
        the beer, and the taste of the beer developes and ages. The beer
        is then consumed.

Where to find more information about making beer??

What other Internet resources are available? You can find more information
        in the newsgroups rec.crafts.brewing, rec.food.drink.beer and
        rec.food.drink. There is a mailing list, "The Homebrew Digest"
        sent out almost daily.  There is an archive of HBD items available
        via ftp at sierra.stanford.edu, in the /pub/homebrew directory.
        There is also a mead-makers archive in the /pub/mead directory.

        For the people that are using World Wide Web, here are some
        interesting URLs

What books are available on homebrewing? One of the most popular is
        "The Complete Joy of Homebrewing by Charlie Papazian. This is
        the book that made the phrase "Relax,   Don't worry, Have a
        Homebrew" popular.
        
Where can I find recipes? TCJOH by Papazian, "The Cats Meow" from the
        HBD, etc etc. 

How should I store my homebrew? The most common method is in bottles.
        These can be either the Grolsh kind, that have a stopper that
        is attached to the bottle, bottles that you put a crown cap on,
        or bottles that you cork. How do I get the labels of the bottles
        that I am going to use for my brew? The most effective method is 
        Commonly said to be by soaking them in a solution of water and
        ammonia. Most labels will fall off after soaking overnight.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Some General Beer FAQ's.. AKA, Pet Peeves that pop up on alt.beer
        all too often. 

What does the "33" on the back of Rolling Rock bottles mean? There are
        several common answers. First, it is said to be the number of
        words on the back label. The story goes that the Latrobe Brewing
        Company was deciding on which slogan to use on the new bottles, 
        and had counted the number of words, and written it on the piece
        of paper that went to the bottle supplier. The bottle supplier
        mistakenly included the 33 on the printed bottles, and it has been
        there since. Another explanation is that it is the year that
        prohibition was repealed. One notable comment about the mysterious
        33 from a Latrobe exec goes something like; "Who cares what it
        means as, long as people continue to ponder it while drinking a
        cold Rolling Rock."
        
What is the thing in Pub Draft Guinness? How does it work?
        Where can I get it?  The thing is a can that has a widget in it
        that is used to produce a creamy head as you pour the beer.
        Probably the closest thing to "draft beer in a can!"

What is CAMRA? CAMRA - the Campaign for Real Ale was formed 21 years ago
        in the UK to protect the rapidly disappearing cask ales from a
        tide of bland keg beers which were being foisted on the public
        by the large breweries. It was fantastically successful (the most
        successful consumer movement in Europe) and now addresses other
        issues such as licensing law and protecting the British pub.
        It has now formed alliances with similar organisations througout
        Europe to deal with impending Europe issues. There are branches
        of CAMRA in several countries (eg Canada). As to Australia, I
        think there is a local organisation - will check it out during
        the break. However, you can get further details from the UK HQ at
         34 Alma Road, St Albans, Herts AL1 3BW, UK.
        Mark Enderby, enderby@daresbury.ac.uk (CAMRA Regional Director)

What is Jagermeister? It is a German herbal liquor. It is NOT beer.
        Discussions about it should be held on rec.food.drink or alt.alcohol
        The same holds for all other beverages... like Everclear... 

How is the typical mass produced American beer like sex in a Canoe?
        WHO CARES!!!! This is a lame joke that has been beat into the   
        ground! Enough already! For newcomers who haven't heard it, 
        the punch line is "Because they are both f*cking close to water."
        YAWN! This joke has been attributed to Monty Python. I will 
        personally email 10 bottles of heavily skunked, over-primed
        homebrew beer grenades to anyone who repeats it on the net. 
        

------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. Questions about alt.beer.

What is it about?
        alt.beer is a newsgroup that was created for the express purpose
        of discussing topics related to beer. 
        
Where are the archives? The alt.beer archives were available via anonymous
        ftp to ftp.cwru.edu. Change directories to ~/pub/alt.beer. 
                ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/alt.beer
        
        In the near future, they will be on ftp.wariat.org under
        pub/alt.beer. 
                ftp://ftp.wariat.org/pub/alt.beer

         that).

         To get a file, send mail to "ftpmail@exchange.tlh.fl.us". In the
        n body  of  the message, type GET FILENAME where FILENAME  is  the
         file  that you  want.  Example to get ALT_BEER.FAQ type
         GET ALT_BEER.FAQ in the message body. The system will then send
         it back to  you in your Email message. These  are  standard  "DOS"
         files with linefeed/carriage returns at each line. Not the files
         are NOT case sensitive.
