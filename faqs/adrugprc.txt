    State: Alabama
Date: June '94
Location: Birmingham
Pot: $450 to $500/Quarter-pound; $40-45/Quarter-ounces. Quality: Most of this
    pot is the standard stuff....not light, but not dark green, and usually
    takes about 3 good bong hits to be stoned for a while...
  * Light green fluffy stuff: $170 an ounce, or $50 a quarter ounce.
Acid: When available, $5 a hit, $7 to $10 to the younger people.

Date: June '94
Location: Fairhope
Pot: $400/quarter-pound, sometimes a pound for $1200 or so...
Acid: $5/hit. Easier to get than in Birmingham
Shrooms: "So plentiful that there is no market...everyone goes and gets them
    themselves...you can pick 2 or 3 pounds of them by yourself in an hour or
    so, if you go to one of the better fields..."


    State: Alaska
Location: Valdez
Date: December '94
Weed: (1/8ths; Increase price about $30-50 for a 1/4, depending on quality)
  * about $40 for some good alaskan weed from the Mat-Su Valley in the summer.
  * About $40 for just about anything in the winter. maybe 30-35$ for Mexican
    weed.
Rock (Crack): about 100-120 for a gram. Sometimes as low as 75$.
Acid: about 4 bucks a hit. Hits are usually good quality. Quantity is usually
    scarce though.
Shrooms: about 30 to 50$ a quarter. but prices are always changing
    dramatically.
Note: The above are street prices. On the street service usually sucks as far
as waiting is concerned. (pay now, get goods in a few minutes policy sometimes)
Prices change dramatically considering quality for everything when winter
hits. Change minorly about every two months. Acid and shrooms are available
only if you yourself have connections. The stuff _rarely_ hits the streets.
Same with coke and rock. in the winter, it never hits the streets.


    State: Arizona
Location: Dead Concert, Buckeye Lake
Date: June 11, 1993
Marijuana: $25/eighth, $45/quarter. Good quality.
           Color: Light to middle green

Location: Phoenix
Date: June '94
Weed: $250-300/ 1/4 lb, $750/lb. Dark green with very small buds, none bigger then about
    1 inch in length.  The smoke is mild, with a quick reponse.  High ranges
    from intense with visions to mild and depressed. Appears to be a strain of
    indica and stavia mixed, or perhaps its the fruits of a stavia and indica
    harvest mixed together. Supposedly a import from South America.
  * Mexican Weed: $5.00/gram, $15.00 1/8th oz, $25.00 1/4 oz, $40.00 1/2 oz,

Marijuana:
    * Mex (shitweed): $25/eight. It's actually better than what the name says.
    I got really worked on this stuff.
    * Green: $50/eigth. This had some really KIND bud in it- juicy and thick.
    The smell was wonderful, and you can get pretty high after three bong
    hits.  Unfortunetly kind of expensive for me.
LSD: $5 a hit, or about $3 if you buy a lot of it. Quality is unknown.
Mushrooms: $20 for an eight, about enough for 2 people. Quality also unknown.

    Weed Santa Barbara has ever seen!" High Times quote)
Hash: not too bad quality, ~30/quarter.
LSD Hits/Shrooms: Very hard to find, but average prices ($3-5 'cid, $20/eight
    shrooms).
Opium: Be real careful here.  There is some shit going around that smells like
    Jasmine.  I think it's that Black Opium insence found in the back of HT.
    It's $20/eighth, but don't waste your money.
*Everything above except for the Kind prices are from around the Venice beach
area.  The 'ganje' I've only been able to find up in Santa Barbara, but it's
well worth the trip.
 [5th source, November '94]
Ecstacy: $20/hit (bought in LA, sellers' market)

  Good availibility.
  $60     3.5 grams
  $425    1 oz.
- Green Bud #2: Dark green nuggets.  Very dense and squishy.  Intoxicating

    skunk aroma, Northern lights strain. Good high 2 hits. $3500+ lb.

 [March '94]
MJ: 750-1000/pound for commercial mex. to get below $900 you need to know an

    it was moldy and didn't smell too good.  Still stony though.


    State: Delaware
Location: Newark
Date: July 24th '93
Alcohol: $1.75 domestics, $2.75 imports, $1.75+ mixed drinks. in a bar
Marijuana: $45-55/quarter, decent stuff, good availability
LSD: $4/hit; Recent brands: Snowmen, plain grey blotter; Availability: fair
MDMA: $20-25/hit "variable, but usually good"
Cocaine: $80/gram last summer for pretty good stuff, I don't keep track
    of coke prices because I don't buy it very often.
Note- "Just about anything is available here, nobody seems to have any trouble
finding weed, hash, LSD, speed, coke or crack. MDMA availability seems to be
highly correlated with certain parties where there is little or no beer and
many weird looking people dancing all night that happen about once or twice a
month. Shrooms, microdots that are alledgedly mescaline (but more likely one of
its more potent analogues), ketamine, PCP, heroin and various pharmacuticals
are all available but if you don't know the right people it might take a week
or two to find them.


    State: Florida

Location: Daytona Beach [April '94]
Pot: 120-1OZ 60$-1/2 40$-1/4 20-1/8. Sometimes good sometimes not so bad.

Nexus - $25 / capsule. Only place I know of to get it is a head shop.
Shrooms - "still haven't seen them, only know of one person who has this
           summer."

Location: Miami
 [Early 1993]
LSD: hits $5 each; sheets $135 (white THICK blotter)
 [November '94]
MDMA: "Seems to be on the upswing in Miami, FL.  Waffers (previously mentioned)
    are going for about $20 each.  This is most likely due to their sheer
    abundance.  Also, some funky lab synthesized what they call "Red Turbos".
    These look little tiny, little, red Advil pills.  Rummors claim that they
    are very clean (chemically.  Few impurities and by-products) and leave you
    no hang-over what-so-ever! Some people claim that they contain both MDMA
    and MDA."
-Note: Some people claim that MDEA (Eve) is surfacing in North Florida, but as
of now it seems to be just another rumour.
 [January '95]
MDMA:
  * Waffers are going for about $25 / tablet.  Discount prices are usually $200
    / 10 waffers, or if you deal (or have the money I guess) $510 / 30 rolls.
    No real complaints on quality, except for some unfortunate souls who seem
    to have bough MDEA instead of MDMA.  Nothing really wrong with the Eve,
    except that if you buy Adam, you expect Adam, not Eve!
  * New MDMA tablets have surfaced (rumours claim that they are from Germany,
    as of now it's still a rumour) that have the word "ADAM" printed on both
    sides of the tablet. Excellent quality.  Prices range between $25 - $30.
    Slightly longer trip length with standard strength.
-Notes: Availability is very, very, very high. MDEA is definitely surfacing in
  Miami, most of the times masked as MDMA.  Prices are usually the same, except
  that the pills are pure white -- no brown specs in them at all.  Slightly
  smaller in diameter, and the groove along the middle is not as deep as in
  MDMA waffers.
 [April '95]
MDMA: -Rumour- "Double Stack Rolls, $30-40 per pill. Suppossedly, they are
    twice as thick as normal MDMA "Rolls", while still having the same size
    diameter.  Price seems to be rather steep for them. Quality reports are
    very positive. Most people comment on how clean the pills are.  Apparently,
    they are few to no impurities in them, and definitely no heroin.  I guess
    that's why people have not been vomiting lately."
    
Location: Sarasota
Date: November '94

    connected to get it regularly.
  * On the street: "Nics" (Nickle bags) containing .5 to 1.5 grams of anything

    State: Indiana
Location: Muncie
Date: February '95
Marijuana: About $35-$45 per 1/4; about $125 per OZ. Constant since about 3/94.
Mushrooms: about $25 for an 1/8th and about $40 for a 1/4oz. But the shrooms
    are REALLY tough to find and can rarely be found, even with quite a party
    campus right here.

Location: Portage
 [October '93]
LSD: Very good stuff. $3/dose, $90 half-sheet of 50. Availibility is good.
    Usually takes a day to get.
[20 December '93- Portage and surrounding cities]
Marijuana: TIGHTLY compressed bud. Dark green, good 'skunky' smell. Strong
    hits, one joint gets even the heaviest smoker stoned. Very easily obtained.
    Delivered right to your door. $40 a 1/4 oz., and $120 an oz.
Note: Slightly less than an ounce is only a misdemeanor in Indiana! They are
searching a lot of vehicles, lately, so if you have an ounce or more, be
careful, it's a stiff felony! Chesterton, Indiana, or neighboring city just
spent a whopping $10,000 for a drug sniffing dog they now carry around to
search vehicles on the spot. First month's statistics are 5 marijuana busts. Be
warned!


    State: Iowa
Location: Des Moines
Date: April '94
Marijuana: 1/8 oz - $25, 1/4 oz - $45-50, 1/2 oz - $85-100, 1 oz - $140-170.
    From the sources I've seen, bags are mostly buds, very little shake. Buds
    are full of red hairs and have a strong, green odor, usually around 2-3
    inches long.  General rule is to get it when shipments first come in, and
    you'll end up with the longer buds with very few seeds, but a few big
    stems.  Very intense high, 1 or two bong hits will send you flying, a
    couple bongloads will knock you on your ass.
LSD: $5-6  Everyone says it takes a couple hits to work
Shrooms: $35 for an 1/8 oz., but I haven't seen 'em.  Pretty rare.
[They really depend on how well you know the source, and availability.

    shrooms, i ate a few stems and lost my mind.  Range from 2-5 caps per
    eighth.

   chocolate thai, etc but the credibility is left up to the buyer to decide
  *MJ is usually sold in Xbags rather than by weight. In other words you
   would get a 20 bag (for $20) and hope that its large.

-Note: "A LOT of good weed out there lately..  When you buy in quantity, it is
    always sold under numerous names, with the different names representing
    different strains ...  i.e. Indica, Lobo, Lethal, etc.......  The quality
    is excellent, go for the BRIGHT green Indica (I thought Indica was purple?
    Mumble...), excellent quality..."

Location: Rochester
Date: Sep/Oct '94
LSD:
    *White blotter: $3-$6 hit, hard to come by. misc potency not great.
    *Speckled blotter (looks loke recycled paper or certs), nice. LONG trip,
     probably $1-$2 more per hit than the white
Marijuana: everywhere.
    *Dry, green brown weed. Small buds (1/2 inch - 1inch) $20-$25 1/8 $80 1/2
     oz. Really fast high, hits like a tank. Also somewhat seedy.
    *Local Grown indoors, sometimes bags are damp. real nice high, large bags
     (> 1oz) have 2"-3" buds in them.  Varying price but usually $20 1/8
    *"Bud-Weed/Kind" Seen a couple of weird bags while "shopping", bags are all
     > 1/2 oz, and consist of a number of 4"-5" buds, no seeds, no shake. The
     buds have one solid stem in the center and are about 1" in diameter, looks
     like the tops off someones local plants, but they try to pass them off as
     imported.. $130-$180 oz. Killer high, buds stick to your fingers .
 [March 17 '95-in city]
Shrooms: 1/8 oz. for $30.  Quality was very poor.  Only a mild pot-like buzz
    when the whole eighth was shared between two people.
Marijuana, Hash, Thai stick: also available (and viewed) but prices weren't
    asked. Hash (free sample given anyway) was of decent quality but nothing
    really special. Marijuana and thai stick of unknown quality though thai
    stick looked rather tempting.
Heroin and Coke: also available in unknown quantities and qualities
 [April/May '95-college campus]
Marijuana:
  * Regular bud #1:  nice green, usually moist and sticky with very happy,
    usually long-lived effects (occasionally even mildly trippy) when enough is
    smoked. Runs $25 an eighth.  This is the common price for most eighths up
    here.
  * Regular bud #2:  Often a fair amount of shake and stem, but an absolutely
    incredible high nevertheless.  Rivals some of the kind varieties purcased
    usually.  VERY reliable buy for a mere $40 a 1/4 oz.
  * Kind bud #1:  Almost too moist, very nice light green color and nice sized
    buds.  Very potent and smooth with a very refreshing smell to it.  $40 per
    eighth.
  * Kind bud #2:  Open the bag for two seconds (or even not at all) and the
    whole room smells.  Overpowering to say the least.  Not as potent as the
    price made it sound at $50 an eighth.  It was really good, but definitely
    not worth that amount of cash.  Spending over $35-40 an eighth up here is
    definitely not worth it, no matter what you're told.
LSD: Comes round in spurts.  You'll go from seeing sheets available to
    absolutely nothing at all for a month.  Not close to the availability that
    pot has but still pretty common with a little waiting involved.  Never any
    complaints about the quality... always been great at around $3-5 a hit.
-Note: Prices have not varied at all in at least a year for the basic varieties
    of pot that will be mentioned here.

    them. 1/8th oz. $25 - $30 of good quality; 1/4th oz. $45 - $50 high quality
    street (skunk, chocolate thai); 1 oz. of hydro $120 (excellent, mellow
    high); 1 oz. of dirt $80 (save your mone)

    State: Texas
Location: Austin
Date: April '94
Marijuana:
  * Commercial Mexican: $25/quarter. Bricked, *very* dry, seedy. Greener than
    other recent batches, fewer red/orange hairs. Harsh smoke, lots of cough.
    High is somewhat shallow, but has a decent duration.
  * Commercial Mexican: $25/quarter. Same source as above, but much lighter
    green, damper. Better, smoother toke, fewer seeds and stems. Stonier.
  * G9: $90/qtr from the grower, $100+/qtr further down the line. This is
    supposedly a (Northern Lights x Skunk #1) x (a whole slew of hybrids).
    Whatever it is, it's the most potent smoke I've ever encountered in my
    life. Let me repeat that. In my life. It looks like a vivid green and
    red thai stick, with very little of the white crystalization seen on
    some of the other Kind in town. The sticks are approximately 1 inch wide,
    and about 1/2 inch thick. A .25 inch slice from a bud, cut into 4 pieces,
    will absolutely fry a half-dozen people. Frighteningly good.
  * Afghani Hash Plant: $100/quarter. Beautiful buds, a little loose. Leaves
    (when dried) are a lighter green than I'd expected from an Afghani, with
    whitish tints in some places, interspresed with brilliant shoots of deep
    red and orange. Very energetic, spacey high.
  * Green Spirit (Big Bud x Skunk #1): $90/quarter. Intense smell from the
    skunk, the dried bud looks like it's been dipped in a sugar glaze there's
    so much resin dried on it. High is very spacy, long-lasting (4-6 hours from
    1 bowl) and good to groove on. Still around from last time (when I in-
    correctly identified it as Green Vision. I blame the drugs :-).
  * Local Skunk Bud, misidentified last time as Jamaican: $75/quarter. This
    was grown outdoors locally (allegedly 300+ lbs.). Big fat nuggets of 
    smooth green smoke, a bargain at the price, especially considering that
    it is moderately-seeded. Lots of people are starting gardens from this
    stuff. The high is medium duration, but very strong and mellow. If the
    seeded bud is this potent, I can't wait to try some of the Sinse from
    it...
  * Reputable friends have reported seeing unharvested Hindu Kush #3, 
    Northern Lights #2, Thai Skunk (Thai x Skunk #1), (Haze x Skunk #1),
    Skunk #1 and 4-Way (Skunk x NL x NL x Skunk). It sounds like upcoming 
    months will be Kind indeed here at the home of the the Armadillo.
