                         August, 1995 Edition
                       Posted Version [part 1 of 2]
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SBI list is a comprehensive guide to BBS systems accessible by telnet
and/or rlogin on the Internet, and is updated monthly.  The files that make 
up the list are available for download from various locations (outlined in 
"Where to find the SBI files"), in a wide variety of ways.  To make this 
posting complete, I've included the most of main files that make up the
actual archive.
 
As of the 3/95 list, the detailed "Guide to Select BBS's on Internet" is
no longer available via Usenet due to its ever-increasing size. 
However, I strongly urge anyone interested in Internet BBS's to get a copy
of the detailed listing, which includes a great deal of additional
information about each BBS than is listed in this posting.  A WEB version
of the detailed listing is also available, and provides a "guided tour" of
Internet BBS's.  To get a copy of the detailed list, or for information
about the WEB page, see the section "Where to find the SBI Files",
included in this posting. 
 
This "posted version" of the list is divided into (2) parts:

PART 1:
        - README.1ST  - Revision information about this month's edition
                        of the SBI list.
        - README.DOC  - General information about the SBI list.  Includes
                        "How to get the SBI files".
        - SYSOP.DOC   - How to become a part of the list; BBS information
                        addition/update form.

        - WHERE TO FIND THE SBI FILES - General info about how to get
                    the complete Guide by FTP, modem, finger, and WWW


PART 2:  The "Quick" Guide to Select BBS's on Internet - a short summary
         of all the BBS's on the list, along with IP addresses.

SBI REVISION NOTES 08/95
------------------------


BBS MAGAZINE AGREES TO PRINT LIST EACH MONTH!
---------------------------------------------
BBS Magazine, which printed the complete SBI list in thier August
issue, has agreed to continue to print the list in future issues!  In
addition, "new" SBI BBS's for each month will be featured with detailed
information about each BBS.  This is a wonderful opportunity for
Internet BBS's to get free publicity!


AMERICA ONLINE EXPOSURE
-----------------------
The "Regate Communications" section of AOL has added an "SBI" button
for AOL users to directly access the SBI WEB Home Page.  The "button"
is somewhere in the BBS section...(I'm not an AOL users, so I've not
actually seen it myself).  Now that AOL users are getting out on the
Internet, a pool of around 10 million potential new BBS users is
certainly nothing to take lightly.  I think most sysops will agree that
this is VERY good news! 


WEB SITE RENOVATIONS COMPLETE!
------------------------------
If you haven't visited the SBI WEB site (http://dkeep.com/sbi.htm)
recently, then I have a pleasant suprise for you!  The site has been
fully renovated and reorganized to be both more pleasing to the eye,
and easier to use.  The best browser to use is definately Netscape,
though the site is still fully useable via text-based browsers like
Lynx.  I've tried to keep the graphics as small and efficient as
possible, but make sure you are using a cache-buffer.  Each SBI entry
uses an icon graphic, and most graphical browsers will download the 
graphic once and use it repeatedly.  If for some reason your browser
attempts to download each occurrance of the icon, there will be over
300 of them - and you'll probably want to turn off your graphics mode!

To help facilitate slower WEB connections, I've added an alphabetical
index to the listing, and broken the list into two parts.  With this
new system, I hope to keep individual files no larger than 200K.  I
think anyone who used the WEB site before, will like the new setup
better.  (If not, let me know!).


SBI LIST FORMAT CHANGE
----------------------
Spent a lot of time last month reworking all the SBI lists (both text
and WEB versions) to make them smaller and more efficient.  This
month's format, you will see, is "cleaner" than before, with much less
wasted space.  If a BBS has no FTP site, for example, then there is no
"label" for FTP site.


THE FILE ARCHIVES
-----------------
In the past, the SBI list HTML pages were "zipped" up and made availble
at the FTP site.  Well, not only did very few people download them, but
anyone can download the source to the SBI HTML pages via their browser
anyway.  These files will no longer be available.

The "import" file for the "Internet Address Book" will also no longer
be available until I get an update to my own copy of this MBBS module. 
Right now I can't test the import files, so it's best I temporarily
discontinue distributing what may be a "bad" import file.


SUBMISSION POLICY CHANGE
------------------------
The only change in submission policy this month is for BBS's that share
the same IP address.  Right now, the SBI list can only include ONE BBS for 
any IP address.  Technically, this is not a policy change at all since only
BBS's with unique IP addresses have been included since the list was
started.  I guess the change is that I'm stating this explicitly as
policy.

If the number of systems acting as telnet-able "front ends" to 
multiple BBS's continues to rise, I may reconsider this policy.  But
for right now, each IP address can have only one SBI list entry -
though the 10-line description can include mention of all the BBS's
available at that site.


NEW SYSTEM REGISTRATION/UPDATE FORM ON THE WEB
----------------------------------------------
With a LOT of help from the good people at Concentric Research (CHRIS),
and specifically  Patrick Doyle at CRIS, sysops are now able to
submit new or updated system information directly via the WEB!  In fact, 
this is actually the BEST way to make sure all your information is included
in future lists.  All you need is a "forms compatible" WEB browser (most 
are).  


GETTING AROUND THE WEB
----------------------
The SBI WEB page was recently listed in Netscape's "New Sites" list, and
is now a permanent option off of Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com).


SBI LIST SPONSORS 
----------------- 
The SBI list depends on a growing number of people and organizations.  
It's only fair that some level of recognition is given for all their 
hard work and contributions.  The SBI printed list and WEB page will \
now feature a short listing of "SBI Sponsors".  These are not "ads", 
but more in line with "sponsors" in the PBS sense :)  On the WEB page, 
the sponsors section will include links to their respsective pages (if 
they have one).

If you think your organization has something special they can
contribute, drop me a note!

(Inclusion as an SBI sponsor is solely at the discretion of the SBI
author, Richard Mark).


GETTING THE SBI LIST VIA INTERNET EMAIL
---------------------------------------
Had a few problems last month with this feature - but they are now
resolved, and the SBI list via email is working well.

To get information on how to access the SBI list via email, send an
email to:

info@dkmail.dkeep.com

Put the single word "SBI" (without the quotes) in the message
TITLE/SUBJECT.  An information file will be dispatched automatically
within 24 hours.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 9/95 edition is scheduled for release the last week of August.

I hope to meet a lot of Internet BBS Sysops at ONE BBSCON (8/16-20) in
Tampa, Florida this year!  See ya there...

Your SBI list author,
Richard (cerebus@dkmail.dkeep.com)

GUIDE TO SELECT BBS'S VIA TELNET         8/95
----------------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading the 8/95 edition of the SBI (Select BBS's on
the Internet) BBS listing.  This listing will be updated MONTHLY, unless
there are no changes or additions to the list from the prior month.  This
list will always be called SBI<MMYY>.ZIP

Files in this archive should include:
-------------------------------------
SBI0895.LST         Select BBS's via Internet list (full detail)
SBIQ0895.LST        Select BBS's via Internet "Quick" list (just
                    names and addresses)
SBIN0895.LST        NEW BBS Systems for this month.

README.1ST          Important revision information 
SYSOP.DOC           How to become a part of the SBI list
HISTORY.DOC         How this list came about


Other files available on the official FTP site (dkunix.dkeep.com):
------------------------------------------------------------------
COMT.ZIP            A great program that redirects Windows
                    communications software to use a telnet connection
                    so you can download via Zmodem from SLIP/PPP


WHY ANOTHER INTERNET BBS LIST?
------------------------------
The answer to this is simple - other internet BBS lists mostly contain
government or educational based BBS's.  They are not what most "BBS'ers"
would usually call a "BBS" - which are very diverse and colorful systems
that offer just about everything - messages, files, games, chat, and other
services - and up until recently, were mostly accessible via long distance
phone calls!  This is a list of "real" BBS's accessible via TELNET and
RLOGIN on the Internet.

We feel a good and FREE listing of these systems will not only help promote 
BBS's on the 'net, but also act as an invaluable aid to the new Internet 
user trying (and sometimes desperately searching) for useful and *fun* 
systems to visit out in cyberspace.  This list does *not* contain any 
opinions or editorials of the systems listed - it is merely a listing, with 
details provided (where possible) by the BBS sysops themselves.


HOW DO I ACCESS THESE BBS'S VIA THE INTERNET?
---------------------------------------------
This "guide" is not designed to be a tutorial of "how to use the
Internet", nor is it a guide to "how to get access to the Internet".
There are hundreds of "help" files available on the network, or on your
favorite BBS to help you out.   Most of the systems listed in this list
offer Internet access, and can be called using a modem and phone line.
Once you get setup on one of these systems (or gain access to the Internet
through some other means), you can access all of the systems listed by
using a "TELNET" client.  This works differently for different systems,
but one common example would be:

telnet <host name>   (ex: telnet boardwatch.com)
or
telnet <ip address>  (ex: 199.84.216.1)

Some systems integrate "telnet" into a menu prompt, which after execution
will simply ask you to enter the host name or IP address.

Some systems also offer the ability to use RLOGIN for the same purpose as
TELNET.  I'd suggest you try TELNET first...

Another method is to telnet via a WWW page.  If you have access to the
Web, you can use this URL - http://dkeep.com/sbi.htm  You will also
need a "telnet" client.  Some browsers have them built-in, but most
don't.  Off of the SBI Home Page is a link to and FTP site with some 
decent clients.

SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT FILE TRANSFERS:
---------------------------------
Even though most of the BBS's listed support "outgoing" FTP, many of the
"PC" based systems listed here do not support FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
TO their PC-Based file systems (which is where most of the files are).
One solution for those that use dial-up accounts for their internet access
(where the user dials into the service with a PC using a communications
package such as Procomm or Qmodem), is to use ordinary "Z-modem" once
telnetted into the BBS. However, in order for this to work, you MUST USE
8-BIT BINARY MODE for your telnet session, or rlogin using the -8 command
line parameter.  Different "telnet" and "rlogin" clients handle mode
settings in their own way, so check with your service, documentation, or
look thru your help files to see how this is done.  Many telnet clients
use "toggle binary" to set 8-bit mode.  

I've accomplished transfer rates of 1800 cps via telnet on a 14.4
connection - so it IS possible.  Granted, the Internet is a fickle place 
when it comes to throughput, so your actual rates will vary.

If you are on a "dumb" terminal that is logged into a Host computer
(like a mini or mainframe), then you have no file transfer protocols
(other than FTP) available to you while in a telnet session, so regular 
BBS file transfers will not be possible.


FILE TRANSFERS WITH SLIP/PPP
----------------------------
For those users with a SLIP/PPP connection, a great program called
"ComT" allows you to redirect a comm port to be a telnet socket!  This
allows you to use ANY standard Windows-based communications software to
telnet to a an SBI BBS and then use a regular download protocol (such
as Zmodem) for file transfers!  The ComT program is available at the
dkunix.dkeep.com FTP site as COMT.ZIP.  Shareware.

Another package called "CommNet" has just become available.  Unlike
ComT, it is a complete communications package in itself, specializing
in SLIP/PPP telnet connections.  It features a phone book for dial-up
AND telnet connections, and supports high speed Zmodem and Ymodem-G
file transfers.  You can get a "demo" copy via FTP at ftp.radient.com
Registration costs $34.95.

For OS/2 users, there are communications drivers called "SIO", and a
communications interface program called VMODEM.  VMODEM, along with the
SIO drivers, create a "virtual comm port" (similar to COMT for WIN), 
that allows any OS/2 communications program to "dial" a telnet address
(ie, ATDT129.45.10.2).  The drivers and programs can be found at most
any OS/2 FTP site, including "hobbes.nmsu.edu" and "ftp-os2.cdrom.com".

SYSOP.DOC  8/95

HOW TO BECOME PART OF THE SBI LIST:
-----------------------------------

There is no fee required to become a part of this list.  The ONLY
requirements are:

1. The BBS must be privately owned (no Freenets, and no University BBS's).

2. The BBS must be accessible on the Internet via TELNET and/or RLOGIN.

3. It must BE a "BBS" of some kind - sites that provide internet
   services, must also have a variety of local services.  This is not a
   listing of mere "internet providers".

4. The BBS must be in operation "24 hours" a day, excluding maintenance
   and mail-run times, and Internet accessibility must be active during
   normal BBS operating time.  (For example, sites that connect to the 
   Internet for only couple of hours a day are NOT on this list.)

5. The BBS must accept new users.  What's the point in advertising a
   "closed" system that won't let anyone login?

We also request that any additions or changes to this list be submitted 
by a sysop of the system (we don't take user-contributions of list
information) - this is to protect the integrity of the list, and the
systems on the list.  Please also be sure to supply a valid internet
address.

THE LIST AUTHOR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REJECT ANY SUBMISSION.  So far,
this hasn't happened...but you never know.  I wouldn't include a BBS
dedicated to kiddie porn, for example.

NOTE: I WILL verify additions to this list via telnet!  I do not
require or request a "guest" account - I am merely confirming that the
telnet address is "alive" and eventually gets me to some kind of login
prompt.

NOTE: Only one BBS listing per IP address!  If you run several "BBS's"
from the same IP address, you can mention them in the 10 line
description.

SUBMITTING NEW/UPDATED SYSTEM INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------
There are now (2) ways to submit new/updated system information:

1 - Fill out the form at the end of this document, and send it via internet
email to: cerebus@dkmail.dkeep.com

2 - Access the SBI WEB page (http://dkeep.com/sbi.htm), and fill out the 
interactive WEB input form. (This is the preferred method)


SUBMITTING VIA EMAIL
--------------------
Submit new systems or updates by completing the information below, 
and send it via internet email to: 

              cerebus@dkmail.dkeep.com 

Please don't send submissions to ALL of the addresses above.  I only
include them in case someone has a problem with the main address (you know
how internet email can be..).

For MBBS systems on other mail networks, other valid addresses are:

       Cerebus@DKM (MajorNET) or Cerebus@30 (Netaccess)

------------------------------------------------------------------
