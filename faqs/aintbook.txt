For more information: (510) 841-2636 or charlotte@library-
solutions.com
Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: (This review covers the first edition.) An instructional
package for librarians teaching Internet basics. This book is useful
for newcomers to the Internet. This book is useful for trainers. This
book is useful for librarians. Ultimately, this book is most useful
for those training librarians who are new to the Internet. A newcomer
to the Internet might find this material a bit disorganized, but very
definitely helpful and useful. It is heartening to see the very strong
emphasis on Internet etiquette and culture which all too often gets
short shrift, even in introductory guides. The grouping of discussion
lists and electronic journals with e-mail is a logical extension which
is not always made. The work is not limited to the novice, though;
many Internet users would find the fact sheets to be a handy quick
reference.

Title: DOS User's Guide to the Internet
Author: James Gardner
Publisher: Prentice Hall
ISBN: 0-13-106873-3
Price: $34.95
Pages: 308
Goodies: DOS disk
Published: 1993
For more information: (515) 284-6751 or phyllis@prenhall.com
Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: A minimalist software package and manual for setting up a UUCP
connection for mail and news. This title is almost completely
misleading. This book is not for DOS users, except that you must be
running DOS to run the MKS UUCP for DOS programs for which this book
is a manual. This book is also not about the Internet, as such. Both
the specifics and the concepts refer to UUCP rather than the Internet.
The text of the book does point out that there are differences, but
the examples given relate to UUCP. That said, for those who are
interested in making their first move to a direct Internet connection,
this could be an excellent choice. UUCP was designed to be quite
comfortable with dialup connections, and this book and associated
programs, help to automate a number of the connection functions while
freeing the user from much of the technical detail that TCP/IP
requires.

Title: Driving the Infohighway - A Guide for VAX/VMS Users
Author: Gerald Neufeld
Publisher: New Fields Publishing
ISBN: 0-920436-54-4
Price: $18.95 (US), $24.95 (CAN)
Pages: 296
Published: 1994
For more information: (204) 729-8943
Thanks for the info: Peter Scott <scottp@herald.usask.ca>
Notes: The book is for users who will be accessing the Internet via a
VAX/VMS host. It is designed for a reader who has some familiarity
with personal computers but who has had little or no experience in
using the VAX. It assumes that the user will be accessing the VAX
using a VT-100 or better terminal or terminal emulation program. It
explains how to access the VAX using a PC on the campus-wide ethernet
LAN or by modem. The book can be used as a tutorial for beginners. The
novice user will find the step by step instructions, practical
examples, and glossary very helpful. However, the book can also be
used as a valuable resource for the more experienced user.

Notes: Mike was the Multics system-programmer at Project Mac, and is
personally responsible for putting two systems on the ARPAnet back
when that meant hacking the OS designed and implemented a number of
protocols including being working-group chair, and has been a
commentator on Internet RFCs since the beginning. (He was also Dennis
Ritchie's officemate before Bell Labs pulled out of Multics & Dennis
had to invent UNIX, and has a personal exemption from Dijkstra to use
a GOTO when, in his professional opinion as a protocol implementor, it
is necessary.) This is a book on style in protocol design and the
great Bromdinagian TCP vs. ISO debates. It's a nice piece of history
and explains where TCP, TELNET, FTP came from.

replying to messages, sending mail to other systems (such as from
America Online to Compuserve), using mailing lists, finding and
downloading files, locating e-mail addresses, and encoding non-text

several places.

Notes: Slade writes: I find it very difficult to define who, or what,
this book is for, but I would recommend it primarily to managers in
charge of large networks and possibly internetworks needing to
evaluate email systems with extended functionality. The title would
suggest this is a discussion of the basics of email. That is true only
in the most simplistic and superficial way.

Thanks for the info: Michael Crestohl
Notes: This book is for the thousands of people who have "only E-mail"
access to the Internet and think all they're going to get is mail. I
get the impression this book is intended for people who have just been
"given" an account and perhaps a cursory description of how to send
and read messages. But we all can learn from it. It's amazing what you
can do with Internet mail if you know how to do it. Clay Shirky shows
you how in this very easy-to-absorb, non-overpowering title.

Notes: The Companion includes a detailed history of the Internet, a
discussion on "netiquette" (network etiquette), and how to find
resources on the net. It is difficult to know what is supposed to be
"companionable" about this volume. Physically, it would be easy to
carry it along with you. You probably wouldn't want to, though. It
does give one some background on the Internet, but it is not in a
step-by-step fashion. (How to access the Internet is the *last* topic
to be covered.) The newcomer to the Internet will more likely want to
read it all (possibly at one sitting; it's small enough) and look at
the network gestalt.

Notes: A grassroots guide to learning about the Internet. It takes the
clueless newbie and leads him from the fundamentals - like
understanding what the Internet is, how to connect and how addressing
works - and through the Internet's most important tools. This book
doesn't cover any ground that hadn't been trod dozens of times before
by other everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-Internet book ever
written, but it delivers the information in a lively, always
interesting manner. No topics are glossed over and the authors never
get mired in the dirty technical details. This book is intended for
folks who will be accessing the Internet using a UNIX command line
prompt. If you are just trying to get started on the Internet, but
don't know which of 50 step-by-step hold-your-hand books in your
bookstore you should buy, The Internet Complete Reference won't
disappoint you.

Notes: A very complete introduction to the world of the Internet.
Along with the obligatory topics such as telnet, FTP and Archie, the
book suggests how to get an Internet account and teaches enough UNIX
to survive on the net. This book is more complete and in-depth than
many other Internet books: Dern's deep knowledge of all things
Internet shines through, although sometimes the book is a bit too
formal. The book, like Dern, is laced with dry humor and is UNIX-
centric. Highly recommended.

Price: $19.95
Pages: 463
Published: September, 1994
Notes: Of the various glossaries and dictionaries of Internet jargon,
Internet in Plain English is among the most complete. Arranged like a
dictionary, it defines just about every term you're likely to hear on
and about Internet and UNIX, from "abbrev" to "'zine". It contains a
lot of technical terms that tech-heads bandy about relentlessly (like
CSO name server, ISDN, and OSI protocol suite) and can give beginners
and intermediate users a leg up in understanding what everyone's
talking about.

Notes: Wild, wacky, and way out there.  That's the only way to
describe this toast to Internet's more bizarre newsgroups, mailing
lists, e-mags, and WWW pages.  Produced in a tabloid format, the
"Insider" explores haiku written by dogs, the SNAG (Sensitive New Age
Guy) movement, and the threat of America being overrun by space-lizard
overlords, with lots of observations by Socks the Clinton Cat.  It's
all a bit much, but this is the first book on the Internet able to be
understood without owning a computer.

Title: Internet Instant Reference
Author: Paul E. Hoffman
Publisher: Sybex
ISBN: 0-7821-1512-8
Price: $12.99
Pages: 317
Published: 1994
Notes: This book is part quick reference, part lexicon and part
Internet tutorial. Arranged in dictionary format, it defines Internet
jargon (like shareware and hypertext) gives brief descriptions of
tools (like Knowbot and Listserv), includes short command summaries
for using popular programs (like FTP, emacs and elm), and describes
various 'net organizations, policies and legislature. Nice design and
layout. This book contains a wide variety of information, but is sort
of unevenly edited and contains some factual errors that might not be
clear to newbies (for instance, in one section it confuses the terms
upload and download.)

Notes: Graham Rodgers says: "64-page guide to Internet basics. Very
easy to follow instructions, clearly set out. With the small size not
everything can be included but the price represents good value. The
paper cover deteriorates with use." I say: A whole lot of information
for the money. Well-presented, simple and above all, short. Covers
"What is the Internet?", terms, UNIX basics, e-mail, Usenet, FTP,
rlogin and telnet, finger, archie, gopher and veronica. Easy-to-follow
examples. They'll sell you just one, but the book is primarily
intended to be sold to service providers and distributed to their

Notes: I used to think that this was absolutely the best Internet book
for Macintosh users that was ever - or could ever be - written. Then,
the second edition came out and proved me wrong. This book claims to
be "everything you need to get on the Internet" and it delivers:
everything from the software you'll need to get connected, to 1,000
pages of copious knowledge. This is a fun, enlightening, excellent
book. If you own a Mac and are on the Internet (or want to connect)
this is the one to get.

Notes: This book is an excellent resource dedicated to Microsoft
Windows users. It isn't quite as strong as The Internet Starter Kit
for Macintosh but is nonetheless a wonderful guide for teaching
Windows users about the Internet and getting them online. It contains
all the software you need to get online and explains how to use it.
The book's resource listings, list of newsgroups, glossary and PDIAL
and nixpub lists are perhaps too thorough - they take up about half
the book.

Title: Internet System Handbook

Price: $54.95
Pages: 900
Published: 1993
Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: Essays by people involved with the Internet. Strong on
protocols, weak on direction. The book is divided into four parts. The
first section deals with an historical and organizational background
to the Internet. The second section, written by the people who built
the Internet, deals with technical aspects of the major protocols and
applications of the Internet. Part three, "Infrastructure," covers
issues not centrally relevant to the operation of the Internet, but
supporting its use: network performance and management, backbone and
node tools, directory services and operational security. The
bibliographic information contained in the book overall might be worth
the price alone. Quarterman's contribution is carefully and fully
researched and well organized. It includes not only texts, but
periodicals and online sources as well.

Author: Seth Godin & James S. McBride
Publisher: IDG Books
ISBN: 1-56884-300-3
Price: $29.95
Published: 1994
Notes: A thick book listing about 100,000 e-mail addresses. (Although
that may seem like a lot, it's not very comprehensive.) Addresses are
listed by last name and are also indexed by Internet domain name. This
book may be useful for finding associates' e-mail addresses, but is
probably no more useful than using one of the many 'net-based e-mail-
address search utilities. The book is unevenly edited (I'm in there
three times!) and was woefully out of date before the ink was dry.

this book is a resource that long-time Internet addicts and new users
will enjoy equally well. Organization is intuitive and consistent.
Although it does not point you to as many online resources as some
other directories, the ones it points to tend to be high-quality and
truly interesting sites to visit. Well-researched and well-indexed.

Notes: Nearly identical to Navigating the Internet (above) except it
includes a disk with Internet Software for Microsoft Windows and a few
extra chapters: "A Better Window on the Web: Mosaic", "Using the
Internet for Business", as well as versions of the online references
Gopher Jewels and PDIAL. I suppose it's worth the extra five bucks for
this book versus the vanilla Navigating the Internet, especially if
you use Windows and need the software.

Notes: This slim book does an excellent job of helping those new to
Cyberspace learn the basic tenants of network etiquette, or
"netiquette". It's easy to read and loaded with interesting real-life
examples. Chapters cover netiquette of e-mail and of discussion groups
as well as providing excellent netiquette guidelines for business,
home and school use. Particularly useful sections cover Electronic
Style (looking good online, tone of voice and signature files) and the
"core rules" of the online world. One chapter covers copyright issues
and another the etiquette of e-mail privacy. There's even a tiny
chapter on "Love & Sex in Cyberspace". This book should be required
reading for anyone collecting their Internet Learner's Permit. (You
can retrieve a brief excerpt from Netiquette: "The Core Rules of
Netiquette" by sending e-mail to netiquette-request@albion.com with
the words "archive send core" in the subject line.)

Notes: Of the various Internet White and Yellow pages books out there,
this one looks and acts the most like a "real" telephone book:
personal listings of your name and e-mail address are free,
advertising space in the yellow pages section is available for a fee,
and the book itself it distributed for free. With only a few thousand
names in the first edition, this listing is hardly the most complete,
but it only contains information about people who choose to be listed.

gives "Practical advice on how to access the "adult side of the

these systems become larger and more complex the issue of how to
manage them becomes more and more difficult. A complete reference on

Notes: The New Hacker's Dictionary is a great book for learning about
the various slang, jargon and customs and folklore of the 'net (as
well as other lairs of the hacker.) Very silly and highly recommended.
You can get it for free online (The Jargon File) at

bathroom reading and contains silly cartoons and stuff.

Price: $29.95
Pages: 800
Published: 2nd ed, 1995
This huge book covers vast ground in its 900-plus pages. Although the
quantity is there, the quality isn't exceptional: it is rather
unevenly edited. Some of the listings seem to be listed by name rather
than subject and many items are listed in multiple places, artifically
inflating the size of the book. This index is unique in that it
contains listings of some commercial services available via the
Internet, such as DIALOG. Icons differentiate the free resources from
the costly ones. Formerly New Riders' Official Internet Yellow Pages.

Goodies: PC floppy disk with useful software. Two periodic updates via

For more information: dilennox@aol.com
Notes: This book (with floppy disk) for MS-DOS users helps newcomers
get online and take their first steps on the 'net. Fraase first wrote
the Mac Internet Tour Guide, and this book seems more like an
afterthought than a follow-up. Chapters cover obligatory topics like
What is the Internet, Getting Connected, Network News, Transferring
Files, Using Gopher and Other Internet Resources. The book's
organization leaves something to be desired: talk of telnet, FAQs and
Netfind (hardly unimportant topics) are lumped together in the "Other
Resources" chapter near the back of the book. The book includes some
interesting real-life examples and ideas for things to do online, but
too much (for my taste) focuses on how to set up and use the bundled
software.

Notes: Fisher shows admirable restraint in limiting the scope of this
book. Where others try to produce "complete" documentation for the
"whole" Internet, Fisher flatly states (correctly) that this is
impossible. Where others try to take you "from the modem up," Fisher
suggests you get some basic experience with local bulletin boards. The
intent is to give desktop (PC and Mac) users some basic grounding in
Internet functions and tools. As such, the book is much less imposing
than most of the others of this ilk. (Cheaper, too.) For the majority
of new users, however, this is a good, basic introduction. What
shortcomings there are in specific information can be quickly filled
in once a user has gotten onto the net. The very personal style here
probably more than makes up for any other lacks--the Internet is
primarily other people, not technologies.

Notes: While not strictly an Internet book, this tome focuses on one
thing: the UNIX program sendmail, which is a huge part of how
electronic mail moves around on the Internet. Mainly for system
administrators, the book shows how to use every function, mode and
mood of sendmail to get your e-mail where it's going. A great, if
single-minded, book.

interested in reading (or publishing) an online magazine, it shows you
where to go for the goods on Usenet, in mailing lists and on WWW. If
you're looking for a job, the authors show you not only how to find
job listings online, but how to use the 'net to reserach prospective
employers and find international job sources. It also covers lots of
ground in education, art, entertainment and business. Even if you've
been on the 'net for years, this book can show you corners of the 'net

are also easy-to-follow instructions for using each one, plus tips,
shortcuts, and pointers to the best and most interesting features.
Interesting stuff, but seems to favor the online services featuring
ZiffNet online. I wonder why...

Thanks for the info: matisse@well.sf.ca.us (J Matisse Enzer)
Notes: This guide should give you a reference to consult if you're
curious about what can be done with the Internet. It also presents the
fundamental topics that are all too often assumed and considered
trivial by many network users. It covers the basic utilities and
information reaching other networks. An earlier, much less
comprehensive version is available via FTP; see previous section.
Matisse Enzer says: Very friendly general overview book. Not really a
how-to book, rather a Cultural Companion that explain what each type
of Internet resource is, as well as the cultural and traditional uses
and issues. Includes a chapter on "Things you will hear about..." this
chapter explains many famous (and infamous) Internet events and
entities.

Title: !%@:: A Directory of Electronic Mail Addressing and Networks
Author: Donnalyn Frey & Rick Adams
Publisher: O'Reilly & Associates
ISBN: 1-56592-046-5
Price: $9.95
Pages: 640
Published: 4th ed, June 1994
For more information: 800-998-9938 or info@ora.com
Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: This book is a reference work. It details the various computer
networks with gateways to the Internet. It is common to cite such
works as "indispensable": in fact, most users, and even site managers,
muddle along quite happily without it. Quick reference "electronic"
versions exist of very similar documents, which provide the addressing
schemes for the more common network and commercial service gateways.
Frey and Adams have, however, put together a very complete and
interesting reference, and I do suggest it to anyone managing, or
using, extensive e-mail correspondence. As a user of electronic mail,
or the manager of a small Internet node or UUCP site, it would be hard
to say that you "need" this book. If, however, you are at all
interested in the topic of e-mail, you will find this fascinating and
useful.
