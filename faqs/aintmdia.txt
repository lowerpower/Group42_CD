        "The people who write the news are on the online services.
         The people who make the news are on the Internet.
         Where would you rather be?"

I. What is alt.internet.media-coverage?

        The newsgroup alt.internet.media-coverage was first created on
June 15, 1994 by the newsadmin at nova.avid.com for "Discussion of
how/why/when/where the media covers the internet and its functions."  This
definition was later adjusted to read as follows: 

> Discussion of the internet as it relates to television, radio, newspapers, 
> and magazines.  
> 
> There seems to be a growing number of media spots/sound bytes on the internet
> these days, and I'm attempting to provide a place for this type of discussion.
>
> The original idea for this group came from someone in news.admin.misc.

        So far, this purpose has held true -- regular readers of the group
post pointers to articles or upcoming television or radio events, and then
critique them later.  In many cases, the authors of the article or report
will join in the discussion -- and this, of course, is the future of media
relations with the public. 
        Many of the groups' regular participants work in the media in one 
form or another, and are polite enough to make that clear at the end of 
their messages; however, it should not be taken that they speak for their 
respective companies unless otherwise noted (though a slight bias is to 
be expected.)

I.1. Which topics are appropriate?

        As described above, just about anything to do with how "The Media"
reports on the 'net is germane to this group.  Critique a new magazine,
cc: your letters to the editor, etcetera.
        Often, these critiques will lead towards other discussions,
including politics, origins of the 'net, semantics, etcetera.  This is
fine, though good netiquette demands that it be crossposted and
followed-up to other groups before it gets out of hand.
        It is _not,_ in any way, shape, or form, for press releases or job
requests (and, yes, we've had both.) There are other places for press
release type material (see below) and there are many *.jobs groups.
        It is also not for advertisements of any type, though we'll let
short things like "look at the new issue of Massive Media Mogul Magazine
for an article on the politics of electronic communication" get past
because they're actually useful. 

I.2. How do I contact the media?

I.2.A. Press releases

        It is considered /extremely/ bad netiquette to send large messages
to people, or to add them to mailing lists, without asking their
permission first.  This also holds true with press releases. 
        Before beginning to send press releases to anybody, contact them
with a short, polite message asking if it would be okay to send press
releases to that account.  Even if it's not, they will probably be able to
tell you which EMail address to send 'em to for the specific publication
or show that they work for.

I.2.B. Letters to the Editor

        The EMail addresses for "letters to the editor," comments,
questions, subscriptions, or anything like that will usually be found
within the first few pages of the publication (usually in the same section
that lists the "snail" mail addresses and fax numbers.)

I.3. Statement on advertising.

        Though the debates about commercializing the 'net and allowing 
advertising and so forth still rage on, there is a general consensus 
among experienced 'net users that off-topic advertising (that which does 
not relate to the purpose of the group) should not be allowed.
        There are two main reasons for this.  One, nobody wants to be
forced to read advertisements for products which they would not be likely
to be interested in.  Two (and this one is the most important one of all),
nobody wants to have to _pay_ for the privelege of reading such 
advertisements.
        Because of that (and because this document is as close as we want
to get to "rules"), please understand that alt.internet.media-coverage is
not and will never be the right place to advertise your products.  We
don't mind seeing a short message like "Hi, I'm the editor of Massive
Media Mogul Magazine, we'll have a big article on USENET in our next
issue" from time to time -- but be warned that your article _will_ be
critiqued.
        Anything longer (especially press releases) is not appreciated.

I.4. Statement on copyright

        Copyright laws are an ever-changing, usually misunderstood mess 
in the United States, and when you remember that the 'net is worldwide 
then the mess is even worse.  So it is possible, though not likely, that 
what I've typed here is wrong.  Still, please try to abide by it.
        It is illegal to reproduce an article in its entirety and post it
to alt.internet.media-coverage or any other group without permission from
the copyright holder(s) (usually the publisher and/or author.) It is
becoming quite common for the author of an article to post it to the group
themselves as soon as they get permission from the editors, and this is
encouraged so long as the article in question is actually related to the
Internet and/or USENET.
        It may or may not be illegal, but is definately rude (and should
be illegal), to quote people's postings to alt.internet.media-coverage or
any other group in your own articles without permission from the author. 
The mere fact that this group is open to the public is not enough -- you
must still ask permission first.

        For more information, check out the Copyright Law FAQ in: 
        FTP charon.amdahl.com /pub/misc.legal/Copyright-FAQ/

        There's also a much longer Copyright FAQ at:
        FTP ftp.netcom.com /pub/ca/carollt/law/copyright/faq/

I.5. Official alt.internet.media-coverage archives

        The newsgroup archives are accessable at:
        WWW http://www.cybernothing.org/jdfalk/html/aim-c.html

        These archives have been processed into HTML, and date back to
June 5, 1995.  There is also a .ZIP (compressed) file containing the
original textual data of each of those messages. 
        Please note that inclusion in the archives does NOT mean that the
message was appropriately posted to alt.internet.media-coverage in the
first place; in fact, an unfortunately large number of off-topic messages
are archived there.  For best results, always refer to this document when
deciding if your message would be appropriate or not.

II. Journalists' Common Questions

        Often, journalists will post a message asking for information
about the 'net.  To get you started, here's a few answers, plus pointers 
towards some of the best resources for more information.

II.1. What is the Internet? 

        The Internet is a network of networks. A network is a group of
computers hooked up together. In the late sixties and early seventies, the
American government decided to create a network that would hook up several
computers throughout the country. This network, know as Arpanet, was the
precursor to the internet. Shortly thereafter, more universities started
to hookup to this network. Because each of the universities were running
different networks, this new Wide-Area Network (WAN) was called the
Internet for Inter (between) Networks. 
        The Internet is not the information superhighway.  It is not 
cyberspace.  It is the Internet.

II.2. How does it work?

        The fundamental base of the internet is a computer tool called
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol). TCP/IP is
essentially the computer language of the Internet. Much like you and I are
currently conversing in English, computers need a common language. TCP/IP
allows computers to exchange information easily. 

II.3. What can I do with it?

II.3.A. Electronic Mail (Email)

        The most popular tool on the internet is Email. It's just like
        writing a letter and taking it to the post office except for a few
        things: you don't have to worry about stamps and envelopes and
        your letter will get anywhere in the world in 3 days or less. In
        most cases, your mail can take no more than 3-4 minutes to get to
        the other side of the globe. 

II.3.B. USENET Newsgroups

        In the early eighties, some young internauts decided that writing
        to someone by Email was great but that it would be better if you
        shared information through some sort of newspaper. Thus was born
        Usenet, the discussion area of the internet. Take your local
        newspaper and imagine that it is broken down into about 10,000
        sections, (called "newsgroups") each of them covering a different
        subject. That in itself would be pretty impressive.  But, what
        makes usenet _truly_ amazing is that not only can you read the
        stories written in each of those newsgroups (they are called
        'posts' or messages) but you can reply via email to the authors or
        post your follow-up on the article for all readers of the
        "newsgroup" to see. Usenet, in other words, is like a giant
        "interactive" newspaper. 

        Please note that there is an ongoing debate about whether the
        term "Internet" is truly all-inclusive enough to include Usenet.
        The main argument against it is that not all Usenet-capable
        computers are connected to the Internet, and vice versa.
        Therefore, it is best to not confuse the two terms.

        For more information, check out the Bible of USENET at:
        WWW     http://www.clark.net/pub/usenet-b/www/home.html
        FTP     ftp.clark.net pub/usenet-b/info/bible-faq

        Another invaluable reference is entitled "How To Find The Right
        Place To Post," and can be found at (one line):
        http://www.ccs.ohio-state/edu/hypertext/faqs/usenet/
                finding-groups/general/faq.html

II.3.C. Chat (IRC)

        Of course, usenet was all good and great but someone decided that
        it lacked _instant_ interaction.  So, he or she created Internet
        Relay Chat (IRC for short), which can easily be called the CB
        radio of the internet. IRC was built in a vein that is somewhat
        similar to usenet (see above for description of usenet) with each
        channel covering a particular subject.  There are literally
        thousands of IRC channels ranging from the raunchy (#hotsex) to
        the holy (#christian) where people converge to chat for hours on
        end. 

        Of course, there's a FAQ for IRC as well, at:
        FTP cs-ftp.bu.edu  /irc/support/alt-irc-faq

II.3.D. Remote Access (telnet)

        If your computer is connected to the Internet, you can (in
        general) log onto it remotely from another Internet location. 
        This is called "telnet" or "rlogin".  For example, at Internet
        trade shows, the sponsor generally sets up a bank of terminals
        connected to a local computer.  Visitors use them to check mail,
        file reports, etc. 

II.3.E. Information Gathering (FTP, Gopher, and WWW)

        One of the great things about the internet is the amount of
        information that is available. There are essentially 3 different
        ways to read stored information across the internet: FTP, Gopher,
        and the World Wide Web (WWW).  FTP, which stands for File Transfer
        Protocol, allows you to exchange computer files. To get such files
        you connect (via the "ftp" command) to an ftp site, a computer
        which stores files.  Both programs and references are stored on
        ftp sites.  Many sites allow anyone (hence the term 'anonymous')
        to read/copy these. 

        Internet users often compile sets of information called FAQs
        (pronounced "faks" -- FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions,
        though the term now means any informational document, frequently
        asked or otherwise) and place them on sites so that other users
        can access them easily.  In the past few years, many companies 
        and governments have also started to make more and more
        information available online, such as text of bills under
        consideration. 

        A gopher server is essentially an ftp site organized in an easy to
        use menu. By moving arrows up, down, left and right, you can go
        through menus of information without having to worry about the
        internet addresses for the computer on which the information is
        physically stored, or even the filename used to store it.

        As powerful a tool as gopher is, it is currently being majorly
        overshadowed and may someday be completely supplanted by the World
        Wide Web (WWW), which takes the interconnectivity of gopher
        servers and adds quite a bit more flexibility. The most attractive
        feature of WWW is that it allows one to mix graphics, text, and
        even sound, music, or moving video on what appears to be one
        "page," or screen of information.  Instead of being a simple 
        menu-like interface as with Gopher, the World Wide Web can be
        organized in hypertext paragraphs, where all you need to do is
        click on (or otherwise select) a phrase, graphic, etcetera to
        retreive more information on it. 

        The most popular and best-known viewer program for the World
        Wide Web is called 'Netscape.'  Also, for those who do not have a
        fast enough connection or powerful enough terminal to handle all
        the graphics, 'Lynx' is a text-only World Wide Web browser.  
        There are a growing number of other browsers currently avaliable,
        including Cello and SuperMosaic, but Netscape, NCSA Mosaic, and
        the University of Kansas' Lynx are the standards by which all
        others are measured. 

        For more info on the World Wide Web, use your WWW browser and
        access the one of the WWW FAQs at:
        WWW http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/faq/www_faq.html

        For more information on Netscape, try:
        WWW http://home.netscape.com/

II.4. Who is on it?

        Anybody and, eventually, everybody.  Contrary to popular
        stereotypes, the Internet is used by as amazing a variety of
        people as one is likely to meet on the streets of any large city
        -- and also people who avoid meeting people on the streets of large
        cities.  Interests and personalities vary widely, and as such the
        only possible pigeonhole into which _all_ 'net users can be 
        placed is "they all have at least a rudimentary knowledge of 
        computer use."

        Some people only have access to Email and Usenet while others have
        what is generally defined as "full access" (access to all the
        services). If one considers Email and News as "being on the
        internet," it is easy to estimate a population of about 20
        million coming from all walks of life. On the other hand, if full
        access is considered, I would hazard a count of about 3-5 million
        hackers, students, academics, and dedicated users.  This number is
        growing daily, even if you don't include the major online 
        services; for example, in Washington, D.C., USA metropolitian
        area, there are approximately twenty-five totally seperate companies 
        offering that type of "full access," with new ones showing up all
        the time. 

II.5. Where can I find statistics?

        Hearkening back to its roots as a network for educational 
        research (but not all the way back to its /real/ roots, military
        communications), the Internet is full of statistics on different
        things.

II.5.A. Statisics about the Internet

        Well, as we said above, it's pretty much impossible to garner 
        reliable statistics about the users.  However, each specific site
        has to be registered with a reliable, nonpartisan system (this
        being the InterNIC), we've found some stastics on the makeup of
        the networks and computers connected to the Internet.  A study
        release by the Internet Society in February, 1994 stated that of 
        the networks connected to the Internet:

                53% were commercial
                27% were research (including commercial research)
                9% were governmental
                6% were defense related
                5% were educational

        Note that all of these statistics are extremely out of date now.

        More statistics about the Internet and related networks can be
        found at the following sites:

        Internet Index  http://www.openmarket.com/info/internet-index/
        Business Statistics  http://tig.com/IBC/Statistics.html

II.5.B. Statisics about Journalism and the Internet

        Paul Ross <paul@paulross.demon.co.uk>, a freelance photo-
        journalist, did a data search of the worlds' newspapers and
        magazines in the commercial database service Dialog, looking for
        the number of articles written about the 'net during the 1990's,
        and came up with the following numbers: 

                Year    Mentions
                1990     2,579
                1991     3,289
                1992     5,578
                1993    11,244
                1994    79,513

        He points out, though, that this listing is not representative 
        of /every/ publication, and there is probably some duplication and
        omission (for example, no New York Times.)

        Another Paul, Paul Kainen <kainen@netcom.com>, replied:
                "Extrapolating these numbers, by the year 2000, I predict
                 the extinction of all life on the planet since we'll be
                 buried in 100's of feet of newspapers to accomodate the
                 Internet stories!"

        A more complete listing of Paul Ross's research is avaliable in a 
        seperate file, avaliable via the following:

III. Other 'net resources

        Though alt.internet.media-coverage is a great resource for 
journalists, its main purpose is and will always be for anybody, 
non-journalists and journalists alike, to discuss how the 'net is 
portrayed by major media.
        P. Fehrmann has listed most if not all of the Journalism resources 
avaliable on the Internet at:
        gopher://una.hh.lib.umich.edu/00/inetdirsstacks/journ%3afehrmann

        Many other newsgroups, mailing lists, and 'net sites deal with 
related issues.  Here's just a sampling of the best....

III.1. Newsgroups and mailing lists

        Not all related newsgroups and mailing lists are listed here, but 
I hope to have all of 'em later on.  If you are a devotee of a group 
which is not listed here, but should be, please EMail <jdfalk@cais.com> 
with a short blurb so I can include it here.

        This group attracts cable television industry people who are
        primarily interested in keeping up-to-date on federal and state
        regulation and consumers who have views to air about the cable
        television industry.
                        -- Cgbg@aol.com

alt.journalism.gonzo
        A newsgroup about gonzo journalism in general and Hunter S.
        Thompson in particular.  Our net motto should be: "When the net
        gets weird, the pros turn here".
                        -- Kevin M. McGrath <kmcgrath@pipeline.com>

alt.journalism.objective
        alt.journalism.objective is a Usenet newsgroup for grassroots news
        and feature reporting.  The single goal is to showcase high-
        quality, minimally-biased journalism written by anyone on the
        Internet.  Articles can be on any subject that a newspaper or
        magazine might carry.  Daily news is preferred. 
                        -- Jeff Chan <chan@shell.portal.com>

alt.journalism.students
        The alt.journalism.students newsgroup is meant to be a forum for
        the discussion of issues of special importance to journalism
        students.  These issues include, but are not limited to:
        journalism programs, student papers, broadcasts, writing,
        internships, professors, journalistic techniques and points of
        law.  The newsgroup invites participation from students around the
        world and of all ages -- high school, undergraduate and graduate
        students alike. 
                        -- Kevin Thom <kthom@chat.carleton.ca>

alt.radio.networks.cbc
        Discusses the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's radio networks. 
        The newsgroup has only existed since roughly the beginning of
        December, and consequently discussion has been minimal so far. 
                        -- Peter K. Taylor <ptaylor@Canada.Sun.com>

        Of particular note is that the CBC is getting involved in the
        Internet in a big way. Many of their shows have e-mail addresses,
        and other things like WWW sites and sound files are coming on-line
        as well. 
                        -- Colin R. Leech <ag414@freenet.carleton.ca>

alt.radio.digital
        Gateway for the RADIO-L mailing list (see below.)

alt.radio.networks.npr
        Discussions regarding National Public Radio (U.S.) it's
        programming, politics, trends, and the underlying issues thereof. 
        Mostly literate discussions with relatively few diatribes.
                        -- Skip Winitsky <skipwin@ritz.mordor.com>

rec.radio.broadcasting
        A moderated newsgroup dedicated to radio professionals,
        para-professionals and others interested in broadcast radio.  We
        cover almost every radio-related topic under the sun, from the

        has an email digest called AIRWAVES RADIO JOURNAL.  For more
        information, send email to info@airwaves.com and request our FAQ. 
                        -- <rrb@deja-vu.aiss.uiuc.edu>

        For more information, the newsgroup's official Web site is:

RADIO-L@vm1.spcs.umn.edu (Internet)
        The RADIO-L discussion list is a forum for addressing the issues
        involved in the transition to a Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)
        standard in the United States and other countries. Discussion
        regarding the relative technological merits of various DAB
        proposals, as well as the social and economic implications of a
        transition to DAB, is welcome and encouraged on this list.
                        -- Ron Stone <ston0030@gold.tc.umn.edu>

III.1.B. Not actually related (but look like they could be)

        The following newsgroups and mailing lists look (going just by the
name) as if they could well be related to the media.  However, they are
most emphatically not for that purpose.

aus.radio (Australia)
        This group has nothing to do with the media.  It's charter is for
        'AMATEUR RADIO' and related topics, which falls into more of a
        hobby/pasttime concept.  This group is often misused for media
        related topics, but that's not it's charter.
                        -- Rob Mayfield <mayfield@itd.adelaide.edu.au>

triangle.radio (North Carolina, USA)
        The Triangle.Radio newsgroup is not a broadcast/media newsgroup.
        It is aimed at Amateur Radio operators in the Research Triangle
        area of North Carolina (Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill). 

        Journalists looking for Amateur Radio tie-ins to local stories
        might find help on Triangle.Radio.  Hams are frequently involved
        in emergency communication, public-service work, and we're an
        interesting hobby.

        BTW, I'm the North Carolina Public Information Coordinator for our
        national organization, the American Radio Relay League.
                        -- Gary Pearce <kn4aq.gary@mms.raleigh.nc.us>

III.1.C. Assorted interesting groups & lists

alt.culture.usenet
        Basically for discussions of anthropology (or sociology, or even
        psychology) of the community sprung up around the usenet groups. 
        Alas, it has started attracting so many idiotic crossposts from 
        other, unrelated groups, that it now takes a killfile to get much 
        worthwhile information from it.
                        -- Jim Jewett <jimj@eecs.umich.edu>

        The alt.culture.usenet FAQ can be found at the URL:
        http://www.wpi.edu/~boigy/text/a.c.u.FAQ.current

alt.culture.internet
        For the net in general.  In theory, this would cover things like web 
        pages, and leave usenet to the usenet group, but in practice,
        there tends to be an awful lot of overlap, and "clued->a.c.u; 
        unclued->a.c.i" would be almost as accurate (but still not very)
        as a division based on the actual names.
                        -- Jim Jewett <jimj@eecs.umich.edu>

alt.usenet.kooks
        For discussing usenet's native kooks.  Particularly mind-bending
        posts from other groups will often be reposted here.
                        -- Jim Jewett <jimj@eecs.umich.edu>

alt.usenet.surveys
        Where all the "I'm conducting a survey" posts _ought_ to go ...
        also the right place to discuss how to do net surveys right,
        though this discussion is sporadic.
                        -- Jim Jewett <jimj@eecs.umich.edu>

III.2. FTP/Gopher/WWW sites

        What with the veritable explosion of information avaliable mostly
or only on the World Wide Web, most of this list is made up of WWW 
sites.  Often, the same information is avaliable via FTP or Gopher from 
that same site.  Here's how to tell:

        WWW     http://www.example.org/amazingstuff/info.html

                        might also be

        Gopher  gopher.example.org

                        and/or

        FTP     ftp.example.org
                directory /pub/amazingstuff

        A little experimentation is usually the best (if not the only) 
way to figure it out.

III.2.A. Sites with lists of other sites

Electronic Newsstand
        WWW     http://www.enews.com
        Gopher  gopher.enews.com

        An amazing number of publications, from AGNI to Chrysler Power 
Magazine to Field & Stream to The Jewish Enquirer to Political Science 
Quarterly to Vibe to Yellow Silk.
        Also include information about subscribing to a number of
electronic versions of paper media, such as NEWSDAY DIRECT and the L.A. 
Times Online. 

I.B.M.'s News Rack
        WWW     http://www.ibm.net/menu09.html

        Though probably not originally meant for the public at large, "big
blue" has provided a great service in this WWW page -- it includes links
to just about every WWW or Gopher site set up by various publications and
other forms of major media, as well as weather reports, public 
media-related sites, and much more.

Yahoo at Stanford
        WWW     http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/News/

        A very complete collection, including most if not all of the 
sites below and probably a number of others as well.  Looks as if it 
probably has a very good graphical interface, but is still easily 
navigated by text-only browsers.

America OnLine's News Hotlist
        WWW     http://www.blue.aol.com/Hotlist/NewsHotlist.html

        Much like IBM's News Rack, America OnLine has compiled a lengthy
listing of media-related sites, which is open to the general public as
well as its own users.  It is thought (but not confirmed) that eventually
this will also include information previously only avaliable to paid
subscribers of the system.

III.2.B. Assorted interesting sites

        These sites are ones which may be of interest to journalists 
looking for more information on the 'net.  Not all are guranteed to be 
useful, but they are certainly interesting.  (Note that many, but not 
all, are also referenced in the text above.)
