-1- General Information

(1.1) WHAT THIS LIST IS, WHY IT WAS CREATED

This list is a compendium of books, organizations, clubs, and businesses which
promote and champion Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. It conscientiously
distinguishes between actual Objectivist organizations and those which merely
claim to promote Rand's philosophy, but actually break from it in fundamental
principles. Its purpose is to expose those interested in Objectivism to a rich
source of Objectivist ideas and products that will further their intellectual
growth and enjoyment. Good premises, All!

-- Jay Andrew Allen, New York, NY 2/20/94


-2- DISCLAIMERS AND LEGAL NOTES


(2.1) DISCLAIMERS

This list is in no way connected to or endorsed by The Ayn Rand Institute or the
Estate of Ayn Rand, although its author supports the former organization.

That an organization appears on this list is no guarantee that it approves of
its inclusion or of the description given to it. If the leaders/owners of any
organization disagree with either, please contact Jay Allen at
<org-comment@oms.com>. If it is a problem with description, a new description
can be worked up; if it is a problem with inclusion, the organization has a
right to request that it be removed.

This is not a list of advertisements. I do not get paid by any of the enclosed
organizations for providing specific descriptions of their products and services
(though money wouldn't be refused -- hint, hint :-).

(2.2) COPYRIGHT AND AVAILABILITY

This list is available for free distribution across the world-wide Internet --
but ONLY if it is reproduced IN FULL, and WITHOUT ANY ALTERATION. Campus and
community clubs may make complete paper copies of this list for distribution to
members who lack Internet access. This list is copyright by me, and is my
property; copies containing additions, subtractions, etc. are violations of
copyright law and will not be tolerated. If you ever find altered versions of
this list, please contact Jay Allen at <jallen@ingress.com> so that the
appropriate action can be taken.

This list is sent to all Usenet newsgroups related to philosophy, as well as to
the groups sci.answers and alt.answers, every two weeks. It is also available
via FTP from the *.answers FAQ site:

<ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/Usenet/alt.answers/objectivism/obj-resource-guide>

and from the FTP directory for Objectivism-related materials at

<ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/aradmin/Objectivism/info/org-latest.txt>. 

A special World Wide Web version is also available at:

<http://power.stu.rpi.edu/~oms/org/>. 

The list's contents are updated periodically.


(2.3) SOURCES AND THANKS

The list is a compilation of organizations, etc. gathered by myself over a
two-year period. Descriptions are mine, unless otherwise indicated.

I would like to thank all the people who have helped in the continued
maintenance of the ORG. The various updates and typographical corrections these
people have provided me are key to keeping the ORG a readable, up-to-date
inventory of Objectivist organizations, and I look forward to receiving more
good information and advice from them in the future.


-3- OBJECTIVISM

Chris Walker's Objectivism FAQ contains a short summary of Objectivism. A fuller
summary, written by me, is available as a separate document. Full lists of
Rand's works, of works by other Objectivist intellectuals, and of excellent
works written by non-Objectivists, are listed in the FAQ and in Todd Goldberg's
Ayn Rand Chronology.

Todd Goldberg's Ayn Rand Chronology:
ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/aradmin/Objectivism/info/rand-chronology.txt

Jay Allen's Summary of Objectivism:
ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/aradmin/Objectivism/info/rand-summary.txt

I must emphasize that a full, systematic statement of Ayn Rand's philosophy is
to be found in Leonard Peikoff's book _Objectivism:_The_Philosophy_Of_
_Ayn_Rand_ (colloquially called OPAR), Dutton Books, 1991. Dr. Peikoff is Rand's
material and intellectual heir; his taped lecture series on the Philosophy of
Objectivism (on which the book is based) was the only such presentation to which
Rand gave an unqualified endorsement. However, as Dr. Peikoff himself points out
in the book's introduction, the definitive source for information about
Objectivism is still the works of Ayn Rand, its sole originator and spokesman.

(4.6) The Objectivist Forum (1980-1987)

The Objectivist Forum was a magazine edited by Dr. Harry Binswanger, with Ayn
Rand as philosophic consultant. It discussed modern culture from an Objectivist
standpoint and ran many philosophical articles and essays, such as excerpts from
Leonard Peikoff's then-unreleased _Ominous_ _Parallels_. It contains articles by
and interviews with Rand and Peikoff that are unavailable elsewhere.

The magazine ceased publication in 1987, but is now available in a bound volume
for $48 (American rate) from: 

TOF Publications 
PO Box 1895, Murray Hill Station 
New York NY 10156

(4.7) The Objectivist Newsletter; The Objectivist; The Ayn Rand Letter 
      (1962-1976)

These were the magazines owned and edited by Ayn Rand. They are all available in
bound format from Second Renaissance Books (see below, section 5.4)

-- THE OBJECTIVIST NEWSLETTER (1962-1965): Many of the articles have been
reprinted in Ayn Rand's books, particularly in _Capitalism:_The_Unknown_Ideal_
and _The_Virtue_Of_Selfishness_. It does contain, however, many book reviews and
interesting answers to reader's questions that have never been published
elsewhere.

-- THE OBJECTIVIST (1966-1971): This 1,120-page book is perhaps the richest of
the three in content. Included: Ayn Rand's essays on epistemology, reprinted as
_Introduction_To_Objectivist_Epistemology_; "Metaphysics in Marble" by Mary Ann
Sures, an essay applying Objectivist esthetics to the art of sculpture; "To Whom
It May Concern," Ayn Rand's explanation of why she broke all intellectual ties
with Nathaniel Branden. The bound volume comes with a six page essay, "The
Rational Faculty," which is Ayn Rand's thinking out loud" about the
philosophical link between individualism and reason.

--THE AYN RAND LETTER (1971-76): This volume is best known for applying
philosophical principles to international issues of the day.


-5- PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

(5.1) Capitalism, Inc.

Capitalism Inc. sells many unique products advertising Objectivist positions on
various issues. From a Christmas card entitled "Ebeneezer Scrooge Was A Virtuous
Man" to bumper stickers with such daring slogans as "The Socialist Redistributes
What The Capitalist Creates", Capitalism Inc.'s products offer convincing
affirmations of Objectivist values.

(5.2) Peikoff Lectures (Out of Business)

Peikoff Lectures rented Dr. Peikoff's taped lecture courses. Lectures included
"Introduction To Logic," "Ancient Philosophy: Thales To Hume," "Modern
Philosophy: Kant to the Present," and the perennial "Understanding Objectivism,"
a great course for those trying to overcome bad methods of thinking that stand
in the way of understanding Objectivist ideas. It also rented Ayn Rand's
Lectures on Fiction Writing, given by her in her apartment in the early 60's.

Though Peikoff Lectures no longer sells these tapes, they are steadily 
being made available for sale through Second Renaissance Books (see below);
contact them for more information.

(5.3) RIC Trading Company

"RIC Trading Company offers products that support and encourage rational
conversation about the principles of Objectivism.  The RIC Symbol (the company's
trademarked logo) is a unique, visual reminder of an objective view of mankind
and his relationship to the universe, including his relationship to himself and
others."

(Written by Kevin Watson, President, and Mark A. Hurt, CEO, RIC Trading Co.)

RIC (which stands for: Reason, Individual Rights, Capitalism) sells shirts,
pins, and other products bearing a unique logo: two human figures, side by side,
holding a dollar sign in mutual comradery.

Recently, RIC has initiated a new line of t-shirts. These new tees sport
stylistic designs which powerfully complement the messages they seek to
communicate. Especially noteworthy are the "Lasseiz-Faire" shirts, which depict
a link of chains breaking from the force of the "Lasseiz-Faire" logo.

For information on these and other available products, contact:

RIC Trading Company 
P.O. Box 270743 
Nashville, TN  37227-0743 
Phone: 615-781-0080 
Fax:   615-781-0083 
E-mail: ric@attmail.com

(NOTE from Kevin Watson and Mark Hurt: The RIC logo is not the official logo of
the philosophy of Objectivism.)

(5.4) Second Renaissance Books -- Ideas For the Rational Mind

Second Renaissance, an Objectivist book service, sports the largest selection of
Ayn Rand's writings and taped lectures available anywhere, and carries an
extensive selection of books which, in the words of editor- publisher Peter
Schwartz, "present...the efficacy and value of reason -- the benefits of free
scientific inquiry and technological progress -- the virtues of individual
achievement and its guarantor: individual rights -- the practicality of freedom
and capitalism."**

-6- INTERNET SERVICES

(6.1) Americans for Free Choice in Medicine FTP Site

Douglas Meier maintains an FTP site for the ad hoc group Americans for Free
Choice in Medicine (AFCM; see (3.9)A below). The site includes several documents
dealing AFCM's position on the health care issue, written by physicians who are
leading the fight against socialized medicine in the United States.

The URL is: ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/afcm/

(6.2) IRC Channel #Aynrand

For over a year now, channel #AynRand on the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has
offered a rational forum for the real-time discussion of Objectivism.
Objectivists and students of Rand's philosophy meet from around the world on a
nightly basis to discuss crucial Objectivist ideas. Every Friday night, at 11PM
ET, there is a scheduled discussion around a specific topic; past topics include
the nature of sex, the importance of hierarchy, and the so-called " Republican
Revolution," among any others. Occasionally, the channel hosts fee-based events
as well, such as Robert Garmong's January 21st lecture on "Capitalism as the
System of Justice."

Currently, #AynRand is stationed on the Undernet, a network of IRC servers
distinct from the main body of servers known as the EFNet. To reach #AynRand
from a Unix machine, type "irc" at the prompt, and then type the following from
within IRC:

/SERVER us.undernet.org 
/JOIN #AynRand

For information on how to reach IRC from a non-Unix (e.g., VAX) machine, ask
your system administrator for details. For some background on the channel,
including the principles by which it operates, check out the #AynRand channel
FAQ at:

ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/aradmin/Objectivism/info/aynrand-channel-faq.txt

For general information on IRC, read the IRC Primer at:

ftp://ftp.undernet.org/irc/support/IRCprimer1.1.txt

(6.3) Objectivism FTP Directory

The administrators of IRC channel #AynRand run an FTP directory for documents
and essays relating to Ayn Rand's philosophy. Currently, it houses my ORG, Chris
Walker's Objectivism FAQ, and transcripts from the Friday night discussion on
the IRC channel #AynRand.

The URL for the site is:

ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/aradmin/Objectivism/

If you have a document relating to Objectivism that you would like to place at
the site, send e-mail to <org-submit@oms.com> containing a short summary of the
document. Everything from informational files to original essays will be
accepted.

(6.4)  Objectivism Study Group

The purpose of this e-mail discussion group is to provide a forum for
individuals to discuss Objectivism with others who are also seriously interested
in ideas. The owner of this service, Bob Stubblefield, expects list members to
adhere strictly to its charter. Although members need not be Objectivists,
pseudo-Objectivists are excluded.  The charter should be read, accepted, and
*understood* before subscribing.

To get a copy of the charter, send a message to info-osg@osg.com. You will also
receive a membership form; if you qualify and want to join, fill out the form
and e-mail it back to the appropriate address. Membership will begin soon
afterwards. The first month is free; afterwards, the cost is $48 for one year
($24 for full-time students).

(Write-up by Jay Allen, with editing by Bob Stubblefield)

(6.5) Objectivist Web Sites

1) Jay Allen's Objectivism Resource Guide
   <http://power.stu.rpi.edu/~oms/org/>
   This is the Web version of this guide. It contains an expanded introduction to the
   philosophy of Objectivism, a biography of Ayn Rand, and assorted multimedia.
   
2) University of Minnesota Objectivist Club (UMOC)
   <http://www.umn.edu/nlhome/g032/objectiv/>
   Resources at this site include past issues of the club's newsletter, upcoming
   club events, and articles written by Dr. Michael Berliner (executive director of
   the Ayn Rand Institute) and Dr. Leonard Peikoff. A good site with lots of
   promise.    
   
   
-7- EVENTS

(7.1) The Jefferson School

1995's Jefferson School has been cancelled due to a personal rift between the 
conference co-ordinators, George Reisman and Edith Packer, and most major living
Objectivist philosophers. Currently, it seems that the TJS conferences are
no more.

Drs. Reisman and Packer have announced the beginning of a new book-selling
business, The Rational Alternative, for which I have no further information at
this point. I will include this information in the ORG as it becomes available.

(7.2) Second Renaissance Conferences

A corporate entity distinct from Second Renaissance Books, SRC was created as a
substitute for the now-defunct Conceptual Conferences. 1994's lecturers included
Leonard Peikoff on Reading and Writing, Harry Binswanger on understanding Ayn
Rand's ideas, and an introductory course in Objectivism for new students, given
by Bob Stubblefield.

For information on future events, write:

SR Conferences 
130 Federal Rd., Suite 56 
Danbury, CT 06811

(7.3) Texas Objectivist Conference (formerly Texas Objectivist Societies
Conference)

The Hill Country Objectivist Association has just issued a call for papers,
workshops, and entertainment for the October 1994 Texas Objectivist Conference.

The Texas Objectivist Conference has a reputation for providing an inexpensive,
high-quality alternative to the larger national conferences. Its speakers
consist of students of Objectivism who seek to apply the philosophy to a wide
variety of fields, and who can present their material at a level of interest to
all Objectivists.

For more information, write:

Hill County Objectivist Association 
4815 West Braker Ln., Suite 502-112 
Austin, Texas 78759
E-mail: <brandy@bga.com>

(7.4) Ford Hall Forum

Every year, Ayn Rand would give a speech at the Ford Hall Forum in Boston. Since
her death, Dr. Leonard Peikoff has carried on the tradition. (All of his
speeches up until 1991 are reprinted in _The_Voice_of_ _Reason_:
Essays_In_Objectivist_Thought_, which also contains many of Ayn Rand's old Ford
Hall speeches.) Dr. Peikoff's latest speech,  held on November 7 1993, was
"Modernism and Madness," which discussed the close link between modern art and
schizophrenia.

For more information, call the Ford Hall Forum at (617)-437-5800.

NOTE: Ford Hall is not an "Objectivist organization," but an independent
organization dedicated to protecting free speech.

(7.5) 21st Century Conferences/Lyceum International 

21st Century Conferences is a new organization sponsoring low-priced Objectivist
conferences throughout the world. Whereas other Objectivist conferences 
occur only once a year in fixed locations, 21-C conferences occur every other
month in locations as varied as Austin, Baltimore, and London. The actual cost
of attending the conference hovers around $170 for three days of lectures by
top Objectivist philosophers.


Lyceum Conferences, the parent company of 21-C, has recently announced that it
will host a 1995 summer conference in San Francisco from August 12-19 to
substitute for the cancelled TJS conference. Speakers will include Drs. Leonard
Peikoff, Harry Binswanger, Andrew Bernstein, John Ridpath, Gary Hull, Mr.
Richard Salsman, and Mr. Peter Schwartz.

-8- ORGANIZATIONS

(8.1) American Renaissance for the Twenty-First Century (ART)

ART, founded by art critic and exhibit curator Alexandra York, describes its
purpose as follows: "To promote and _advance_ established western art forms;
realism in painting and sculpture; melody and harmony in music; grace in dance;
structure, coherence, and meaning in theatre, poetry, and literature -- and the
expression of Beauty in all." It is a staunch advocate of Romantic Realism in
the arts.

One of its best products to date is a catalog highlighting pieces from an
exhibition called "ROMANTIC REALISM: Visions of Values," given to anyone who
makes a $10 contribution to ART. In addition, ART recently began publishing a 
newsletter, "ART Ideas", available to regular contributors.

To find out more about ART, contact:

P.O. Box 8379 
New York, NY 10150-1919

(8.2) Americans for Free Choice in Medicine

(NOTE: This is not an Objectivist organization; however, its goals and methods
are so much in tune with the Objectivist ethics and politics that I thought it
more than fitting to place here. Hopefully, in the near future, more such groups
will spring up, meriting a section of their own in the ORG.)

"Americans for Free Choice in Medicine (AFCM) is an organization dedicated to
the defense of individual rights in the realm of medical care. We uphold the
values of individual liberty, personal responsibility, and non-coercive free
markets. AFCM is a vehicle through which any individual can help introduce
free-market principles into the medical market place. AFCM's main mission is to
educate the public about free-market solutions to the problems in our health
care system and about the dangers of socialized medicine."

(8.3) The Ayn Rand Institute: The Center for the Advancement of Objectivism
(ARI)

A non-profit organization, ARI is the premier organization devoted to spreading
Ayn Rand's ideas throughout the culture. Its many activities include:

clubs stocked with Objectivist literature and lends taped lectures for public
broadcasting;

--The operation of a Campus Speakers Bureau: past speakers have included Harry
Binswanger on "Why 'Buy American' is _Un_-American," George Reisman on
"Education and the Racist Road to Barbarism," and Peter Schwartz, Richard
Salsman, and Richard Sanford on "The Case Against Environmentalism: Moral,
Economic, and Scientific."

--The sponsoring of auctions and banquets, such as The Fountainhead 50th
Anniversary Banquet being held in Boston this November;

--Two contests: A _Fountainhead_ Essay contest open to 11th and 12th graders,
and an _Anthem_ essay contest for 9th and 10th graders.

(8.5) The Association of Objectivist Businessmen (AOB)

AOB was founded in 1988 by businessman and lecturer Richard M. Salsman to 
support Objectivism in the business community. It has defended Wall Street, real 
estate development, and other legitimate forms of business on the basis of Ayn 
Rand's morality of selfishness.
