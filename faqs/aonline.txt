* Computers and Academic Freedom (CAF)
  CAF is a list/newsgroup/archive devoted to issues of computing, 
  freedom of expression, and privacy, especially in relation to the edu-
  cational and academic communities.  CAF is available in several forms,
  is archived, and has been provided storage space by the Electronic
  Frontier Foundation for a collection of related important documents.
  comp-academic-freedom-talk (caf-talk) is the interactive discussion
  version of the list.  comp-academic-freedom-batch is a digested version
  that presents each day's contributions as a single compilation, rather
  that a continuous stream of incoming separate messages. 
  comp-academic-freedom-news is a digested version featuring a weekly 
  sample of the most important messages.  comp-academic-freedom-abstracts
  is a weekly digest containing only abstracts rather than the full text
  of the list.  For more detailed information on the versions, send a message
  body of "LONGINDEX" to listserv@eff.org.

* Cybermind
  "An electronic forum for the discussion of the philosophical and
  psychological implications of subjectivity in cyberspace...We are
  interested in particular in the philosophical, psychological/
  psychoanalytic and social issues engendered, particularly as they concern
  the user and the social [realm]...: the psychology of intimacy, the role
  of gender, the phenomenology of the terminal screen, neurosis and
  paranoia on the Net, the relationship of lag to community and communi-
  cation, sex/gender/sexual orientation theory and electronic subjectivity,
  the role of the symbolic or imaginary in computer communication, the
  implications of symbolic extensions of the human ('external memory', and
  so forth), fantasy and the hallucinatory aspects of email/USENET
  groups/MUDs, and the psychoanalysis of lurking."

* Cypherpunks
  The Cypherpunks mailing lists exist for those interested in cryptography
  and it's political rammifications, programming encryption software,
  creation of digital cash and electronic banking via secure (and
  anonymous) crypto tech, local crypto-oriented activism, hacking cypher
  hardware, and more.  There also tends to be much libertarian/
  anarcho-capitalist debate as well.  The main list is fairly high-traffic.
  The UK branch generally goes by the name of UK Crypto-Privacy Assoc.,
  and like some of the other local sub-groups, has face-to-face meetings.
  The CypherWonks list is a split-off that is generally opposed to the
  anarchic stance of some on the main list.  A recent addition to the stable
  is Cypherpunks Lite, a lower-traffic version for more serious participants.
  Joining the list requires a membership fee [don't have address for this
  yet]. I have no info at the moment on the local groups, other than the
  Austin & Boston Cypherpunks, so if anyone has info to pass on please do so.

Use any mailreader, such as elm, pine, eudora, etc., to participate in
mailing lists.  To subscribe, try mailing to [listname]-request@[address].
Failing that, try listserv@[address], majordomo@[address],
listserver@[address], listproc@[address], and finally
owner-[listname]@address or [listname]-owner@[address].  Never send
subscribe requests to the list itself; this does nothing but irritate people.
The subscribe command is usually SUBSCRIBE [listname] [your first name]
[your last name]; failing that, try SUBSCRIBE [listname], SUBSCRIBE
[listname] [your email address], SUBSCRIBE [your email address] [listname].
If all else fails, try replacing "SUBSCRIBE" with "ADD", "JOIN" or "SUB".
If you still can't get on the list, try sending "HELP" to one or more of
the addresses, putting the command on the subject line instead of in the
message body, and it you still can't get on this list, ask
postmaster@[address] for help.  You can also send a note to all the
listserver authors you can find and ask them to cooperate with
other authors to standardize, before we all go crazy.  ;)

* IMPORTANT: Subscribe commands, and the like, when given in quotes mean
"type this command, but without the quotes."  Likewise <firstname> <last-
name> means "put your name here, without the angle-brackets." Unless
otherwise noted, all parts of the command should be on the same line in
your subscribe message.  Example:   Subscribe: listserv@eff.org, message
body: "subscribe effector-online" means send an Internet email message to
listserv@eff.org, with a message body consisting of the single line:

subscribe effector-online

without the "quotes".

Gopher resources are, when possible, pointed to with full paths, rather than
menu titles.  If your gopher client cannot handle paths (directory names),
please ask the producers of that software to add support for paths, and URLs,
in their next version.  You'll need to see the documentation for your gopher
client to see how it expects paths to be specified.  For the standard unix
gopher, for example, the syntax is:
gopher -p <path> <site> <port - optional if port is 70>
such as:
gopher -p 1/EFF gopher.eff.org 70

WWW users: to convert a gopher path to a URL: prepend "gopher://" to the site
name, and fuse the path to the site name, inserting an extra "/1" at the
beginning of the path.  If you have to use the port number, insert it and
a preceding colon between the site and path:
 "gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF" becomes "gopher.eff.org:70/11/EFF/"
To convert an FTP location to a URL, prepend "ftp://" to the site, and join
the path to the site:
 "ftp.eff.org, /pub/EFF/" become "ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/"


* WHO/WHERE: This list is maintained by Stanton McCandlish <mech@eff.org>
and FAQ-ized and distributed by L. Detweiler.  It is based on the list
at the end of the Online Activism Organizations FAQ (itself based
on an older list by Shari Steele). Future updates will be posted to the
ACTION mailing list and comp.org.eff.talk, besides several other
places.  The most current version is available from:
ftp.eff.org, /pub/EFF/Issues/Activism/activ_resource.faq
gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Issues/Activism, activ_resource.faq
http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Issues/Activism/activ_resource.faq


* SCOPE: This list includes activism forums, and topical forums
(computing futures, access to govt. info, privacy and censorship, regional
politics, NII/GII/"Data Superhighway" issues, virtual community, civil
liberties & human rights, etc.)  The list focuses on: 
 1) activism about online issues like those topics mentioned above, and 
 2) general activism strategies and tools available online.  

The listing of all activism issues & resources (e.g. [non-]smokers' rights,
environmentalism, gun ownership/regulation, etc.) and partisan politics
specifics, is outside the scope of this list.  NOTE: Organizations' "house
organs" are not listed here, and soon neither will be govt. publications or
servers.  "Enforcement" of this is not yet consistent.   Organizational
resources (e.g. CPSR mailing lists, PRC ftp servers, etc.) are listed by
organization in the 2nd part of this FAQ, the Online Activism Organizations
List.  Government materials will be in a 3rd list some time soon.  In the
mean time, see several documents providing info on govt contact and
service online, available from ftp.eff.org, /pub/EFF/Issues/Activism/.


* YOUR LISTING: Please! Check your entry regularly and make sure it is up to
date. If your forum/pub/site does not have a description, please send one
ASAP, or there's not really much point in listing you.  Please expand on your
forum/publication/site's contact information as much as possible.  Thank you.

Cavazos, John S. Quarterman, Jon Lebkowsky, Shari Steele, L. Detweiler,

know of other resources that we should add, are are making something new
available at your site, please forward the name and description of the
material, and contact information, to Carol Woo <carolwoo@mcs.com>. 
Please also inform of any updates or changes that need to be made.

to ensure that the principles embodied in the Constitution and the Bill
of Rights are protected as new communications technologies emerge.
Since its inception, EFF has worked to shape our nation's communications
infrastructure and the policies that govern it in order to maintain and
enhance First Amendment, privacy and other democratic values. We believe
that our overriding public goal must be the creation of Electronic
Democracy.

 Australia

* Association for Community Telematics (ACT)
  Founded in 1993 to help promote an enlightened democratic order in the
  emerging cyberspace. Telematics = telecommunications + informatics -
  the socio-technological aspects of computer communications and
  networking. In the information revolution underway in Australia,
  the grassroots level of the community is being overlooked.  The gap
  between the information rich and the information poor is growing wider,
  and the broader community has yet to gain direct access to these tools 
  of the information revolution.  There is a danger that the evolving
  information society will be more about social control than empowerment
  of the community.  ACT serves as a lobby for greater resources to develop
  community-based computer networks, to simplify the use of these networks,
  to provide better support for new users, and to encourage a wider range
  of people, including those with no previous experience with computers, to
  come online.  ACT exists to encourage all sectors, including government,
  the private sector, community groups, educational and research sectors,
  activist groups and trade unions, to develop a vision statement and a
  plan for Australia's transition to a more democratic and socially just
  information society.

* CommUnity (Computer Communicators' Association)
  Formed in 1993, to repesent the interest of the UK online community. It
  was initally formed in response to the threat of BBS licencing posed by
  the ELSPA (European Leisure Software Publishers Association) and FAST
  (Federation Against Software Theft); and out of widespread concern over
  growing press and media misrepresentation of the comms-using community
  in the UK.  To date CommUnity has: actively responded to a number of 
  television documentaries and magazines misrepresenting computer-comms 
  users as primarily software pirates and pornographers; Met with a key 
  Member of Parliament to head off a proposed BBS licensing scheme; pro-
  duced a comprehensive report for a Home Affairs Select Committee
  enquiry into computer pornography; lauched its own electronic magazine,
  CommUnicator.

  professional association organized for scientific, literary, and
  educational purposes and dedicated to the creation, organization,
  dissemination and application of knowledge concerning information and its
  transfer.  Founded in the mid-1930's, ASIS has a history which stems from
  the earliest days of the modern era of documentation.  ASIS counts among
  its membership some 4,000 information specialists from such fields as
  computer science, management, engineering, librarianship, chemistry,
  linguistics, and education.  ASIS and its members are called upon to help
  determine new directions and standards for the development of information
  policies and practices. The mission of the American Society for
  Information Science is to advance information professionals and the field

* Americans Communicating Electronically (ACE)
  ACE membership is diverse and represents private and govt. organizations
  and individuals who wish to promote interactive communications among
  federal, state, and local governments, private businesses, public
  libraries, and schools, rural cooperatives, public and private
  universities, community-based arts and theater groups, voluntary
  associations, job training services, and health care organizations.  The
  members of ACE are particularly concerned that access and participation
  be made possible and convenient for Americans who do not own modem
  equipped computers. To support the development of interactive
  communications between governments and communities, ACE is recommending
  that all government agencies establish information access programs to
  help create and foster an "interactive citizen-government communications
  system."  Many govt. agencies, from the White House to the NSF and the 
  Dept. of Labor, are already participating in the ACE project.  Unlike
  everything else on this list, ACE is actually a govt.-sponsored project.
  There are several ACE mailing lists: ACE-MG (general ACE info), CET-MG
  (Communities in Economic Transition), CET-NEWS (C.E.T. bulletins), etc.

  EFF-Austin was formed to protect constitutional guarantees of free

  the national EFF but became independent in 1993 while retaining
  contacts with the parent organization. We're heavily involved
  in public speaking, education, and advocacy of constitutional
  rights in cyberspace. "We're Austin's forum for discussion of all
  concerns related to the cutting edge where society meets technology."

ADMINISTRIVIA
============= 
 

* WHO/WHERE: This list is maintained by Stanton McCandlish <mech@eff.org>,
and FAQ-ized and distributed by L. Detweiler. It is based on a previous
version by Shari Steele.  Future updates will be posted to ACTION mailing
list and comp.org.eff.talk, besides several other places.  The most current
version is available from: 
ftp.eff.org, /pub/EFF/Issues/Activism/activ_groups.faq
gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Issues/Activism, activ_groups.faq
http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Issues/Activism/activ_groups.faq


* SCOPE: This list focuses on: 
 1) organizations dealing with online issues such as cryptography,
    intellectual freedom in networking, and access to government information,
 2) organizations working on access to online resources, and supporting 
    community networking, and 
 3) general  activism and civil liberties organizations providing material
    online. 
The listing of all activism groups (e.g. [non-]smokers' rights, environment-
alism, gun ownership/regulation, etc.) and partisan politics groups, is
outside the scope of this list.


* YOUR LISTING: Please! Check your entry regularly and make sure it is up to
date. If your org/group does not have a description, please send one ASAP,
or there's not really much point in listing you.  Please expand on your
group's contact information as much as possible.  Thank you.

 
* BIG ORGS: Wide-spread organizations, with many local affiliates,
subdivisions, or chapters, are listed as one organization.  So far, this
includes CPSR, NPTN/Free-Net, and APC/IGC.  To list all the local groups
individually would consume a large amount of space, and would
make this list much longer than it needs to be.

 
* THANKS to: Steve Barber, Simona Nass, Art McGee, Ed Cavazos, John S.
Quarterman, Jon Lebkowsky, Shari Steele, L. Detweiler, Elizabeth Reid,
Bernard Aboba, Ellen Pack, Eric Hughes, Derek Atkins, Tom Gray, Karl
Lui Barrus, Malcolm Arnold, Mike Godwin, Shari Steele, Phil Agre, Jim
Warren, Carl Kadie, Kurt Fuchs and all the other folks I pumped for info.


* CONTRIBUTIONS: We are constantly looking to update this list, so if you 
know of other groups that we should add, or if you are trying to form a 
group in your local area, please forward the name of the group and contact 
information to Stanton McCandlish <mech@eff.org>.  Please also inform of any
updates or changes that need to be made.

infrastructure and the policies that govern it in order to maintain and
enhance First Amendment, privacy and other democratic values. We believe
that our overriding public goal must be the creation of Electronic
Democracy.
