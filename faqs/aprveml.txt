     *** Frequently Asked Questions About E-Mail Privacy ***
                               by
                    Andre Bacard, Author of>
                  THE COMPUTER PRIVACY HANDBOOK
                   [Version February 25, 1995]
 
  ============================================================
     This article offers a nontechnical overview of possible
     threats to YOUR e-mail privacy, and it suggest two key
     steps that you can take to guard your privacy. I have
     written this especially for persons with a sense of
     humor. You may distribute this (unaltered) FAQ for non-
     commercial purposes.
   ===========================================================
 
Can people (secretly) read your e-mail?
 
     Very likely yes. Most electronic mail is notoriously
     UNPRIVATE. E-mail is less secure, and in many ways more
     dangerous, than sending your personal or business
     messages on a postcard.
 
Who secretly reads your e-mail?
 
     A MACWORLD survey found that roughly 25% of the
     businesses contacted admitted that they eavesdrop on
     employee computer files, e-mail, or voice mail. This 25%
     excludes unauthorized e-mail monitoring. When I asked a
     Silicon Valley C.E.O. if he uses e-mail, he said: "Hell
     no, Andre. Half the nerds in my company can hack e-mail.
     E-mail is a party line!"
 
     Internet e-mail, the kind that brought you this FAQ, is
     child's play for some people to intercept. Your typical
     e-mail message travels through many computers. At each
     computer, people can access your personal and business
     correspondence.
 
     It's a safe bet that administrators (not to mention
     hackers) on Bulletin Board Systems, college campus
     systems, commercial information services, and Internet
     hook-up providers can read your e-mail. Of course most
     snoops will deny they're reading your e-mail because they
     want to continue doing so.
 
Doesn't my password protect me?
 
     Charles Piller, in his excellent article entitled "Bosses
     With X-Ray Eyes," reports on a study MACWORLD made of
     Macintosh software. Here is part of Piller's conclusion:
 
     "All the major electronic-mail and groupware products
     that combine messaging, file management, and scheduling
     (such as WordPerfect Office) allow the network
     administrator to change passwords at any time, then read,
     delete, or alter any messages on the server. With few
     exceptions, network-monitor programs such as AG Group's
     LocalPeek, Farallon Computing's Traffic Watch II, and
     Neon Software's NetMinder, allow astute managers to read
     files transmitted over the net. In short, these tools are
     only slightly less invasive than others specifically
     designed for surveillance and used primarily on mainframe
     systems."
 
     Unix, Dos and other software networks are just as easy
     for administrators to manipulate. Who is to stop your
     Internet hook-up provider or any network supervisor from
     using or distributing your password? 
 
What motivates a snoop?
 
     Maybe he's a thief who sells company business plans or
     customer lists. Perhaps she's the office intriguer trying
     to play people against you. Possibly he's a computer
     stalker like the fellow who shot actress Rebecca Schaffer
     to death. Conceivably she's a blackmailer. Maybe he's an
     old-fashioned voyeur. Information is power. Snoops want
     power.
 
Whatsamatter, I've got nothing to hide. Why do I need e-mail
privacy?
 
     Show me an e-mail user who has no financial, sexual,
     social, political, or professional secrets to keep from
     his family, his  neighbors, or his colleagues, and I'll
     show you someone who is either an extraordinary
     exhibitionist or an incredible dullard. Show me a
     corporation that has no trade secrets or confidential
     records, and I'll show you a business that is not very
     successful.
 
     Robert Ellis Smith, Publisher of the PRIVACY JOURNAL,
     quips, "An employee with nothing to hide may well be an
     employee with nothing to offer."
 
     Privacy, discretion, confidentiality, and prudence are
     hallmarks of civilization.
 
OK, maybe I could use e-mail privacy. What can I do?
 
     There are two big, practical steps that you can take.
     First, use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software to encrypt
     your e-mail (and computer files) so that snoops cannot
     read them. PGP is the de facto world standard software
     for e-mail security. Second, use anonymous remailers to
     send e-mail to network news groups or to persons so that
     the recipient (and snoops) cannot tell your real name or
     e-mail address.
 
Where can I learn more about these privacy tools?
 
     Two excellent places to start are the Usenet news groups
     alt.security.pgp and alt.privacy.anon-server.
 
     Also, I've written two FAQs, one about Pretty Good
     Privacy and the other about Anonymous Remailers. To
     receive them, write:
 
     To: abacard@well.com
     Subject: Send PGP & Remailer FAQs
     Message: [ignored]
 
     [Almost everyone who writes me wants both FAQs. Thus, I
     send them together. If I'm out of town, I'll e-mail you
     when I return.]
 
Anything else I should know?
 
     YOUR privacy and safety are in danger! The black market
     price for your IRS records is $500. YOUR medical records
     are even cheaper. Prolific bank, credit and medical
     databases, the Clipper Chip Initiative, computer matching
     programs, cordless & cellular phone scanners, Digital
     Telephony legislation, and (hidden) video surveillance
     are just a few factors that threaten every law abiding
     citizen. Our anti-privacy society gives criminals and
     snoops computer data about YOU on a silver platter.
 
     If you want to protect your privacy, I urge you to join
     organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation
     <membership@eff.org>.
