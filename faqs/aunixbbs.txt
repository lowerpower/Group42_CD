Subject: 1. What is a BBS?
Date: Mon May  8 00:29:41 EDT 1995

BBS is an acronym for Bulletin Board System.  This is software that allows
a computer to be used as a message posting and reading system that has
some similarities to a bulletin board you might find in an office
or in a grocery store.  Users of the system can post messages and read
messages posted by others.  Many computer BBSes also allow the users to
send private messages to other users, andor to "download" files that are
stored on the computer.  Some BBSes also allow users to run other
programs (such as games) in addition to the BBS program.

Some BBS programs allow the individual BBS systems to share messages by
using a communications medium to exchange the messages via a standard
protocol which the BBSes understand.  Such systems are "networked"
BBSes.  There are several BBS Networks around the world. Among them are
FIDOnet, WWIVnet, RIMEnet, VNET and Usenet.

Some of the commercial computer service providers (e.g. CompuServe,
Prodigy, America OnLine, etc.) provide BBS systems as part of their
regular services.

Care should be taken to distinguish between the "public" messages of a
BBS system and "private" Electronic Mail message services that may be
provided by a computer service.

Subject: 2. What is UNIX?
Date: Mon May  8 00:30:14 EDT 1995

UNIX is a trademark of ??? Inc. (*) for its brand of
multi-user, multi-tasking operating system software.  UNIX was developed
at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the late 1960's and has become the most
portable operating system ever developed.  This portability means that
UNIX (or Unix-like) operating systems can run on nearly any computer
that has been developed since 1975.  Unix-like operating systems run on
computers from the Intel 8086 through the gamut to computers like the
Cray X-MP and the Connection Machine 5.  Programs written for one 
Unix-like system can be moved (fairly easily, if written with portability 
in mind) from one Unix system to another with some minor editing and 
re-compiling of the source code on the new machine.

The history of Unix-like operating systems is quite complicated, and
there are several versions of Unix-like operating systems in existence.
The two major divisions of these are AT&T UNIX systems, and BSD Unix
systems.  There are lots of others, but these two versions cover most of
the territory in terms of portability issues.  Truly portable Unix
software packages can examine the software environment and automatically
configure themselves when the user compiles the package.

Unix operating systems are flexible and portable for many reasons, and a
detailed examination of that issue is not relevant here.  For more
information see the Unix-FAQ posted regularly to comp.unix.questions.

(*) At last sighting, the holder was Open Systems Foundation or someone
like that.  Be sure that it is still held by someone!

Just who *is* the actual holder of the TradeMark on UNIX is
something that can change with bewildering rapidity.  At various times
it has been the "offical" property of: AT&T, Bell Laboratories, Western
Electric and other groups.  These names, of course, are also registered 
TradeMarks of their respective owners. :-)

Subject: 3. What is Usenet?

Usenet is a network message sharing system that exchanges messages in a
standard format.  Messages are arranged into topical categories called
newsgroups.  Newsgroups can be thought of as analogous to the channels
in broadcast television.  The messages contain plain text information 
(which may include encoded binary information) and a series of headers 
that define who the message came from, when the message was posted, 
where it was posted, where it has passed, and other administrative 
information.

Usenet/Netnews is a dual entity.  On one level is it merely the messages
being passed from machine to machine using known protocols. On another
level is it the people (the readers and posters of the messages) who
interact with the computers.  Care should be taken to not get too
confused when people talk about "Usenet is...." because of this duality.
Usenet should not be mistaken for any underlying transport mechanisms that 
provide other services in addition to the transfer of the messages.  
That is, Usenet is not UUCP, Usenet is not a particular network or set 
of networks (e.g. the Internet).

One should also be careful to not confuse Usenet with any particular
group of users.  That is, Usenet is *not* an american network, Usenet is
not a network of computer scientists, and Usenet is not a network of
system administrators.  It is a complete cross-section of all the sorts
of folks who use computers either for work or play.  English *is* the
common language of Usenet, but there is no guarantee that the users
*know* english particularly well. :-)

By one popular definition, Usenet is the newsgroups in the major
categories of comp, misc, news, rec, sci, soc, and talk.  There are a
number of other major "hierarchies" which may be worldwide (alt, bionet,
vmsnet),  regional (usa, can, triangle), or even organizational
(duke, ut, sun).  These message hierarchies use the NetNews protocols,
and are colloquially called "Usenet", but purists can (and do) argue for 
days about the distinctions.  I tend to use the term "NetNews" to refer 
to the whole suite of programs and all the newsgroups in conglomeration.

There is not enough room here to fully discuss the ins and outs of
NetNews.  There are several NetNews groups that are dedicated to
discussion of NetNews itself.  (news.* and alt.culture.usenet are
examples, the `*' refers to any newsgroup that begins its name with a
string of "news.")

There are additional regular FAQ (frequently asked questions) postings
in the newsgroup "news.announce.newusers" and the newsgroup "news.answers" 
that provide much more information about this topic.

    contact:    Bob Kirkpatrick
                root@dogear.spk.wa.us

    demo:       none known

bbs_bk is a shell system that provides the primitive functionality for a
BBS on Unix. Unix commands available determine how much real
functionality is available.  Usenet is available via calls to the
newsreader of choice on the system.  Editors depend on sysop choice.
Download protocols depend on what is available on the underlying system

bbs_bk  is a skeleton bbs that should allow an experienced unix user to
provide basic BBS functions in short order when a need arises.  A
special "bbs" user login is needed to start up the bbs capability.

Brand-X is a C language skeletal BBS similar in flavor to bbs_bk (no
suprize).  The sysop needs to know C and Unix fairly well to turn this
package into something more than a toy.  Like bbs_bk, a bbs user id is
required and the program takes care of its own user names.

Caucus is a large and robust commercial package.  It is supported on
several hardware platforms and provides a complete networed BBS
solution.  User customization is supported.  I actually got two
responses to requests for Caucus, from Aule-Tek, the owners, and another
company that sent me information via paper mail.  Despite being asked
for pricing, no pricing information was sent.

I do know that the City of Santa Monica (California) selected Caucus as
its platform for its Public Information System.

        Citadel is a whole world unto itself.  Citadel code is/was
widely available, and it has been ported to may different platforms and
environments.  From PC-clones, to the Amiga, to Unix, they all tend to
work the same way.

        Citadel uses a slightly different organizing metaphor.  There
are rooms which may contain messages, files and bulletins (in any
combination.)  You move from room to room and read the messages or
browse the file lists.  You can "forget" rooms to unsubscribe, and there
can be multiple operators on a Citadel system (sub-ops.)

        Finding Citadel is problematical, I've been singularly
unsuccessful in several attempts (even using archie.)
Quartz.rutgers.edu may be the best bet.

        Michael is developing yet another DOS look-alike UNIX BBS for
the Linux platform.  This implies source availability, but since it
looks like he wants to make it a commercial product, it is more likely
to be a binary (object code) distribution rather than source.  The
project sounds ambitious, with replacements for the mailer, and
additional modules for connecting to FIDO Technology Networks, in
addition to all the usual BBS features.
        Pricing and availability are not known.  MQ comments that it
will be a "low cost" system, with per-module pricing.

This is an Extension of the Mars Pirate BBS code to enhance
functionality and provide some network access.  It now features an IRC
(Internet Relay Chat) client mode so that users can participate in IRC
if allowed.  Usenet may be supported via shell access, but I haven't
tried the demo system or read the code that closely.  It is in current
use, so it has some support and merit.

Notes are given to me that EBBS runs in a "chroot" environment.  It has
hooks for "doors" and chat.  Known systems in use: SunOS4.1.x,
ESIX/SysV, AIX 3.2, Ultrix, Alpha OSF/1.

This seems to be a fairly complete BBS system that is well-integrated
into Unix (except for Usenet News).   The system looks easy to configure
and provides linkages to standard E-mail (via smail or deliver).

Usenet can be provided via external functions (doors).

                magpie.nycenet.edu?

        Magpie has a good reputation, but its limited availability
(binaries only for SCO COFF compatible systems) is a drawback. It
supports lots of nice features that are easy to provide via Unix, and
seems aimed at K-12 school systems that want a "real product" for use
with some standard platform.
        Installation is via special login account, and BBS users do not
have standard "/etc/passwd" accounts.  No pricing was posted for Source
code availability.

        I got a posting from Steve Manes, and he points out that the COFF
binaries are a "Shareware" version.  NetNews support (using NOV
database) is planned for version 2.4 (no ETA), but version 2.3 has
UUCP/internet mail available for BBS users.

        Recently announced was a version for AIX on the IBM RT
        platform.

    contact:    Volker Schuermann
                Volker.Schuermann@unnet.wupper.de

MBox is an excellent product, marred only by the lack of decent
documentation in a language other than german.  Its basic services are
those provided by Unix, and Unix services are required to run the BBS.
The current version is limited to System V r3.2 Intel platforms, but
should not be too hard to transfer to other System V platforms.

C-News (or B-News) and a mail package are needed.

Volker announced a new version recently, and there is an MBox mailing
list.

MBS is a new Unix based BBS.  Reminiscent of Citadel (there are rooms)
the implementation is totally new and interesting.  All the basic
functionality for a networked BBS is there, but it's still in
development.  Usenet will be via message importing/exporting programs
now being developed.  (Development has slowed down for a while.)

Pink BBS is a bare bones shell (bourne) BBS that relies heavily on
external programs for its functionality.  The notable missing piece in
the alt.sources posting was the "mkacct" program which apparently
collected the information and installed a new unix uid account
interactively.  This is NOT a secure system.

The "Hotel Mars" bbs at Mississippi State was a legend in its own time,
mostly for the furor it created on the internet.  Part of this was due
to the unfortunate choice of name for the software, and the activities
of a similar nature that occurred at one time.  I thought I had a copy
of this one, but it isn't on-line here, so I apologize for the short
schrift it is getting.   It does provide a complete BBS solution in
messages, files and upload/download.

        Once again, the Mars BBS is down, and supposedly for good this
time. (Boo)   The code lives on in EBBS and several others.

QueBBS was written for the North Dakota State University by members of
the Studen ACM chapter there.  It is a complete BBS service, with
messages, files and private mail.  Usenet support is via special
programs that import and export articles to/from the BBS and the news
system on the computer.  Upload/download protocols depend on what is
available, and are configurable.  Online help is available, menus are
hard coded.

There is a little confusion about whether the NoDak bbs is the same as
the "quebbs" that is listed as available for Coherent.  Here is the
results of an Archie search for quebbs.

MMB is agressively pushing TEAMate as the "premier" Unix based BBS
system in the country.  My inquiries netted me two copies of PR
materials and several phone calls about the product.  The package looks 
complete, with a full-fledged conferencing system, file support, and 
full configuration management.  There is a (MSDOS) client program for 
it called TEAMterm, that they say is freely distributable, but I 
don't know where there is a copy on the net.  I had some problems with 
the manual, which was obviously written by/for someone with absolutely 
no knowledge of the Unix underpinnings.  The system is full screen, 
form oriented, and uses the Unix termcap/terminfo libraries.

Prices are steep(*), a single cpu intel license starts at $2000, and the
full package starts at $5500.  More users bring the cost up rapidly,
with an "unlimited users" full package totalling $63,000.  (Price list,
july 1, 1992)  Systems supported include: Intel, Sun, HP-UX, DEC (RISC),
IBM RS/6000, ATT 3b2, Sequent, DG, Silicon Graphics, and Tandem (UNIX).
[Sequent 4+ cpu starts at 15,000, full: 40,200.  Most systems are going
to be 4000-7500/12,800-21,900.] 

* - recent mail from TEAMate folk say that a new lower cost (8-line)
entry-level version is available starting around $2000.00.
Additionally, they report new educational pricing and discounts.

A GUI client/server version is planned for showing in August 1993.

User support is friendly and knowledgable, I called to clarify the
ability to include Usenet messages.  It would take a programmer a bit of
time to do it, but it seems easy enough.

        TERM is a commercial terminal emulation package for UNIX and DOS
that supports file transfers and script driven interfaces.  According to
a brief conversation with one of their folks after hours (good service!)
the system *could* be used to create a BBS system.   FTP support is
available in the package, and more literature is being sent to me for
review.

UniBoard is a decent Unix BBS according to most reports.
Price is reasonable, an 8-user license costing about $70 (US).   
Full functions include Usenet news, email, files and online 
chat/conferences.  Usenet and mail require the use of the underlying 
Unix systems (C-news recommended.)  Security seems good,
customization seems good.  Support for other networks (e.g. FIDO) is
promised in the future.  ANSI character graphics support, color support.
Support for multiple editors, etc.

Latest information is available from Riccardo's mail server.  Mail to
uniboard@nervous.com with "SEND LIST" in the message body.

Linux is supported as of version 1.12.

Note:
        Downloading the files listed in the FTP site lines are not
sufficient to run UniBoard.  You must still contact the folks listed in
the documentation to obtain a "key" to make the BBS run.

If I keep saying I'll wait until I get this cleaner before I post it,
it may never get posted.  And prompted by yet another thread of "Where
can I get a UNIX BBS with UseNet news?" I figured more fuel for the
fires can't hurt :-).  What we have is this:

     * UseNet news reader
     * UseNet/UNIX/Internet mail reader (w/multiple mail areas)
     * Looks like a Citadel room-based BBS system
     * Secure shell (controlled access to external programs, uses rsh)
     * External editors, file-transfer, chat/talk, CB
     * Newsgroup and file permissions (r, r/w, hidden and invite-only)
     * Freely-redistributable
     * Has compiled once or twice each on SVR2 (Microport), SVR3,
       SunOS 4.1 and UHC SVR4
     * Can be used with CNews, BNews, SMail, Deliver, talk, rz/sz,
       kermit, vi, emacs and more
     * still contains a few, uh, unnecessary, uh, features  yea that's it.


  You can play with it and download the source from Bitsko's Bar &
Grill BBS, +1 801 566 6283 (Telebit), login 'guest', type RETURN for
password.  Source and discussion is in the Unidel room.

        XBBS is a decent BBS system for System V'ish systems.  The code
is rather monolithic, and the menus are embedded in the code.  The
system has similarities to the WWIV BBS in style.   Configuration is via
static files that are position dependent.  Limited access groups are
available, multilevel security is supported.  Access to NetNews is via
shell escape(!) and might be insecure.  I've got XBBS running here at
the Wolves Den (actually it is now the ISIS BBS :-)  with a fair number
of modifications in place.   XBBS's user base is handled seperately from
the Unixen /etc/passwd file, and runs as a "startup shell" from a "bbs"
login.
        The provided configurations allow for 99 message areas, 99 file
areas, 99 "special interest groups", and individual messages are limited
to 99 lines each.  There is no message import or export function.  The
builtin text editor is all that is available.  Some of the support
programs will require heavy modification if you change the directory
structure of your layout from the "standard."   The "sysop" shell
support command needs some work too.

        Download/upload protocols are limited to Xmodem, Y modem, Z
modem and kermit, and requires the installation of the RZ/SZ package
from the net, and Unix Kermit.  XBBS can be brought up quickly and
fairly easily if you can match the "standard layout" that Sandy
recommends.

Z/Max has a very full featured Unix BBS here.  The package seems cleaner
and more "professional" than TEAMate, and the price is also a bit more
reasonable, even if the hardware supported is less extensive.
Features: BBS, News (Usenet import supported), Files (upload/download -
standard protocols plus external protocols), "doors", menu interface,
graphical (character graphics) interface, on-line conferences, Email
(internet access), multi-level (per-function) access security, custom
editor (? vi or emacs access?), and full logging.
Terminal support is flexible, and the system uses "curses" for its
character graphics interface.
Hardware: 80[34]86 Unix boxes (SCO, Interactive, AT&T, SVr4), 88000 BCS, 
NCR, SEQUENT, Sun, IBM RS6000, HPUX, Dec Ultrix (4.2), AT&T 3B2.

I have recently put up a new version of the Yabbs (yet another bbs)
software package on my machine (phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu).  This is a small,
highly portable bbs package for unix that supports:
  * up to 26 public message bases (plus one private area)
  * multiuser talk
  * g-files support (to put text files online, good for mirroring ftp
    servers)
  * up to 3 external editors and one external pager (I include keybinding
    files for less and joe, and have source for a version of elvis with
    some commands removed).
  * has a menued structure (as opposed to command line structure of waffle)

So far it has been proven to be very portable across unix variants. 
Comes with full source (all pretty well commented) so changing it around
isn't too hard.

Current platform is 386bsd, portability may be affected by this.

If you want to see a copy in action telnet to phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu 8888. 
You can ftp the source from the same machine in /pub/yabbs.

(uglymouse.css.itd.umich.edu also has sources.)
