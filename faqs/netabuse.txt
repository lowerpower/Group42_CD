POLITICS
========

1.1) What is news.admin.net-abuse.misc, and why was it created?

news.admin.net-abuse.misc was created to replace
alt.current-events.net-abuse and news.admin.policy. The former was one
of the most widely read and respectable alt.* groups, while the latter
had become largely a mess of messages cross-posted from a.c-e.n-a and
news.admin.misc.

news.admin.net-abuse.misc is, not surprisingly, for discussions of
net-abuse (see "What is net-abuse", below): definitions, occurences,
objections, complaints, battle plans, peace plans... Check out their 
charter in the appendix.

1.2) What is news.admin.net-abuse.announce, and why was it created?

At the time of the newsgroup reorganization (early 1995), a.c-e.n-a
traffic amounted to dozens and dozens of messages every day. Many of
these were pure speculation or kvetching, while many others were of
the dreaded, hated, one-line "I saw this spam in rec.bedding.sheets,
too!" breed. The messages of real importance to news admins, such as
genuine spam announcements and spam-cancel announcements, were
buried. Lots of people grumbled about this, and wanted a moderated
group that was a digest of a.c-e.n-a.

So in this writer's opinion, news.admin.net-abuse.announce's only
purpose is to serve as that digest. During the voting, a couple of
people were worried that the moderators of n.a.n-a.a would become some
sort of legislative or judicial body. But they don't want to, and we
don't want them to.

Remember the Usenet way: "If they get carried away, we'll laugh at
them and make fun of them and not let them play with our jacks."

Check out their charter and guidelines in the appendix.

1.3) What was alt.current-events.net-abuse, and why was it created?

Here's the 'charter,' or at least the text from Thomas Koenig's
newgroup message of April 25, 1994:
  
  alt.current-events.net-abuse is a forum to discuss the current
  net abuses, such as "spamming" of Usenet by the law firm Canter &
  Siegel, and related issues.  This disussion, at the moment, takes
  up most of the bandwidth in news.admin.misc and news.admin
  policy, and clearly merits a separate forum.
  
  It was proposed on alt.config in
  <2p8q9s$idl@nz12.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>, and met no opposition
  there at all.
  
  For your newsgroups file: 
  alt.current-events.net-abuse   Usenet spamming, Green Card and the like

1.4) What is net-abuse?

Since the newsgroup's inception, many curious forms of Usenet behavior
have been discussed on it. Of these, spam is the one most universally
accepted as 'net-abuse', which is why it gets its own section
below. Other Frequently Aired Complaints are discussed throughout the
FAQ.

However, as Neil Pawson says, "it's for abuse *of* the net, NOT abuse
*on* the net." Just because somebody does something vile, we don't
necessarily want to hear about it on n.a.n-a. To qualify as true
panic-inspiring net-abuse, an act must interfere with the net-use of a
large number of people. Examples of this: newsgroup flooding,
widespread or organized forgery campaigns, widespread or organized
account hackery, widespread or organized censorship attempts...

1.5) What is the purpose of this FAQ?

This FAQ is *not* intended as a comprehensive guide to
netiquette. Many things that this FAQ appears to treat lightly are, in
fact, extreme breaches of netiquette. The FAQ primarily attempts to
answer: are these situations "net-abuse", in the sense that the whole
world should hear about them?

1.6) What questions does the FAQ leave unanswered?

An infinite number, featuring:

   * What is the Breidbart Index? (forthcoming)
   * Should Velveeta with a BI of 20 be cancelled? (I don't know)
   * What is jello? (I don't care)
   * Are all ads bad? (beyond the scope of this FAQ)

1.7) Who's responsible for this FAQ?

It's maintained by Scott Southwick (scotty@indiana.edu). The
information has been gleaned from various Usenet sources --primarily
posts to the n-a groups made by a wide variety of authors-- and so the
maintainer must actively disclaim all responsibilty for the veracity,
advisabilty and/or legality of anything contained in the FAQ. Thanks
to the following people who have contributed to it, or at least
discussed its contents in a non-threatening manner:

Arthur Byrne, Pekka Pirinen, Keith "Justified and Ancient" Cochran,
Lamont Granquist, Victoria Fike, J.D. Falk, Steve Patlan, Wilf
Leblanc, Seth Cohn, Neil Pawson, Bram Cohen, Mitchell Golden, Rahul
Dhesi, Stephen Boursy, Mary Branscombe, David Cortesi, Alexander
Lehmann, Greg Lindahl, Jack Hamilton, Morten Welinder, Axel Boldt,
Richard Lee, an48985, Phil Pfeiffer, John van Essen, Pierre Beyssac,
Michael Shields, Travis Corcoran, and several others I have
undoubtedly missed.

Contributions are always warmly welcomed, as are suggestions,
corrections and criticism. Unfortunately, the update lag-time has been
pretty fierce recently.

1.8) Where can I get it?

The finished version will be posted either bi-weekly or semi-monthly
(whichever you prefer) to n.a.n-a.*, alt.answers, and news.answers. It
will also be available by anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu and its
mirror sites. A frequently out-of-date hypertext version is available
at

1.9) I don't understand a single word of this.

The best starting place for learning about Usenet is Indiana
University's Usenet Resources page, at

    http://scwww.ucs.indiana.edu/NetRsc/usenet.html

[I put that together at my day-job. This entry is a shameless plug for
my employers.]  It's got links to most Usenet primers, netiquette
documents and news FAQs, Son-of-RFC-1036, some charters, newsreader
man pages, &c.


SPAM, SPAMMERS, and MOOSES
==========================

2.1) What is Spam?

It's a luncheon meat, kinda pink, comes in a can, made by Hormel. Most
Americans intuitively, viscerally associate "Spam" with "no nutritive
or aesthetic value." The luncheon meat has its own newsgroup,
alt.spam.

The term "spam," as used on this newsgroup, means "the same article
(or essentially the same article) posted an unacceptably high number
of times to one or more newsgroups." CONTENT IS IRRELEVANT. 'Spam'
doesn't mean "ads." It doesn't mean "abuse." It doesn't mean "posts
whose content I object to." Spam is a funky name for a phenomenon that
can be measured pretty objectively: did that post appear X times?
(See: "Yeah, but how many is X?')

There have recently been examples of "customized" spams--where each
post made some effort to apply to each individual newsgroup, but the
general thrust of each article was the same. A huge straw poll on
news.admin.policy, news.admin.misc, and a.c-e.n-a (December 1994)
showed that as many of 90% of the readers felt that cancellations for
these posts were justified. So, simply put: if you plan to post the
same or similar messages to dozens of newsgroups, the posts are
probably going to get cancelled.

If you feel that a massive multi-post you are planning constitutes an
exception, you are more than welcome to run the idea past the readers
of news.admin.net-abuse.misc for feedback first.

It should be noted that cross-posting a single message to many
newsgroups (which many call "velveeta") is definitely *not* considered
cancellable spam by those who cancel spam. That doesn't mean it's
always a swell idea, though, and a large cross-post will probably
evoke many flames. If you *must* cross-post, set the followups to a
single appropriate group by adding a header line like

  Followup-to: group.name.here

This prevents the readers of all the groups from having to deal with
the thread for weeks afterwards if the readers of only one or two of
the groups take an interest in it.

2.2) Where did the term 'Spam' come from?

From the Monty Python song that goes, roughly, "Spam spam spam spam,
spam spam spam spam, spam spam spam spam..." See?

The term wasn't first used to describe mass news posting, however. See
the Hacker's Jargon File for previous uses of the word.

2.3) Tell me about the Great Spammers.

So as not to duplicate effort, here's an excellent archive devoted to
the various bug- and honey-bears of the Net:

  * The Net.Legends archive (particularly the Net.Legends FAQ)
      gopher://dixie.aiss.uiuc.edu:6969/11/urban.legends/net.legends

  * The Net.Legends FAQ (html version)
      http://www.shadow.net/~proub/net.legends/

(The alt.usenet.kooks Web Page has just plain old disappeared...?)

Not all of the kooks and legends discussed there are spammers, or even
villains. Spam fans should pay particular attention to the entries on
Serdar Argic, the spiritual ancestor of today's spammers.

2.4) Who were Canter and Siegel?

Unfortunately, it's "Who *are* Canter and Siegel?" They're lawyers,
authors, and Usenet newbies _par excellence_. Super-newbies. Honorary
Permanent Newbies. When they sit around the net, they sit *around the
net*...

C+S weren't the first spammers, but they were so gothically clumsy
about it, and so intent on making a buck, that people were terrified
and infuriated into starting this newsgroup.

2.5) Where can I get more information about them?

The best archive of Canter and Siegel-related postings is maintained
by C&S themselves; last time somebody checked with "ls -r", the
fun-loving net.lawyers seemed to be storing every post that mentioned
them (can you say "grepping for libel cases"?)

If you're not C or S yourself, though, the next best info source is
Thomas Leavitt's "The Canter & Siegel Report," available via anonymous
ftp from

   ftp://ftp.armory.com/pub/user/leavitt/

Those files are zipped. Users with access to 1990s technology should
check out the WWW versions at

   ftp://ftp.armory.com/pub/user/leavitt/html/cands.report.html
   ftp://ftp.armory.com/pub/user/leavitt/html/candsrpt.two.html
   ftp://ftp.armory.com/pub/user/leavitt/html/candsrpt.three.html

There's also a wonderful article on the pair available at

   http://www.interlog.com/eye/News/Eyenet/CS2.html

Many, many more docs are available, but I'll stop there.

2.6) What should we do about the book?

2.9) Who is Cancelmoose[tm]?

Cancelmoose[tm] is, to misquote some wise poster, "the greatest public
servant the net has seen in quite some time." He or she sends out
spam-cancels and then posts notice anonymously to news.admin.policy,
news.admin.misc, and a.c-e.n-a. The Moose stepped to the fore on its
own initiative, at a time (mid 1994) when spam-cancels were irregular
and disorganized, and has behaved altogether admirably-- fair,
even-handed, and quick to respond to comments and criticism, all
without self-aggrandizement or martyrdom.  Cancelmoose[tm] appears to
have near-unanimous support from the readership of all three
above-mentioned groups.

Nobody knows who Cancelmoose[tm] really is, and there aren't really
even any good rumors.

By early 1995, several others had stepped into the spam-cancel
business, and appeared to be comporting themselves well, after the
Moose's manner. Far fewer cancels are coming from the Moose's
anonymous address now.

NITTY-GRITTY
============

3.1) Yeah, but how many times is 'X'?

How many posts does it take to push the spam envelope? To use up all
your spam charity points? For a bare-bones spam? To trigger the
raging-spam-cancellers-from-Hell? 

Among those who agree that spam should be defined solely by quantity,

             -----------------> 20 <--------------------

appears to be the magic number, or at least a number so
middle-of-the-road that it provokes very little passionate dissent in
either direction. Notably, Cancelmoose[tm] refuses to set a firm
number, in the belief that people would simply post [X-1]
messages. It's safe to say that a couple incidents of 19-post spams
would cause the magic number to plummet. Thus, 20 should be considered
a vague approximation only.

Passionately dissenting note: Rahul Dhesi [dhesi@rahul.net], one of
the fathers of the cancel-bot movement, sticks by the following
definition:

     More than five physically distinct postings with substantially
     identical content posted within a period of ten days.

3.2) How can I tell if a post is forged?

Sometimes it's easy to spot a forgery, sometimes it takes years of
experience, and unfortunately, sometimes it's just impossible. (Note:
most newsreaders don't show the entire header. Yours may have a
command (e.g. 'h' in nn, 'v' in rn and trn, CTRL/h in tin, 't' in
gnus, stop me) that allows you to see them in their entirety. If it
doesn't, save the post to a file -- if given the choice, use 'mailbox'
format.  Then bring that file up in an editor.)

For starters, these four sites in the header should agree:

--The From: line, listing the site where the poster is.

--The 'path:' line shows all the sites the message passed thru, on its
way *to* you (most recent, to oldest).  So the poster's site should be
at (approximately) the end of that path.

--The last part of the 'message ID,' which is the originating site
name.

--On many posts there is an "NNTP host" field, as well.

The last item in the "Path" header line is the poster; working
backwards, it lists the hosts the message passed through until it got
to the server the reader uses.  First check on a supposed forgery is
whether the host that supposedly posted the message is on this list in
the correct location.  However, even if it were that doesn't mean it
isn't a forgery since wily forgers forge part of the path line before
slipping the message into the usenet.

The Message-ID: is a unique id number created by the posting
software. In all cases that we know of, the posting machine's ID is
appended at the end of it. Sometimes, but not always, this matches the
poster's account. Sometimes a slightly different machine in the domain
is used for posting, and may vary slightly. But if the sites in the
message-ID and the poster's account vary wildly--e.g., netcom.com and
army.mil--you may be dealing with a forgery.

Some other ideas:

* Check the time stamps; if the site and the time zone don't agree,
something might be up.

* With experience, you can look at the intermediates on the 'path' and
spot things that look 'funny'.  If a message that purports to have
come from someone in Detroit, MI, goes bouncing thru half-a-dozen
sites in EUROPE, before arriving in Chicago, IL -- it's likely its a
phoney origin.  If you have the advantage of knowing about what sites
are connected to where -- even for a few sites-- you can spot a fake
if it shows routing between two machines that you *know* don't talk to
each other.

However, as Steve Patlan cautions: "I posted a message from Austin, TX
that went through Austria.eu.net (something like that) before reaching
(a newsfeed received from Rice U in) Houston, TX."

* The "Organization" line, which is usually set by the site's news
administrator (but can be easily changed by the poster for purposes
legitimate or devious) may also contain clues. If somebody's trying to
cause trouble for a particular organization, for instance, they may
include it, but not get the name or address right.

Of course, if the forger simply forgets to alter the Organization
line, you may get clues that way also.

For more information on headers, see RFC-1036, "Standard for
Interchange of Usenet Messages," at

    http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1036.html

(Thanks to Robert Bonomi, Arthur Byrne, Emma Pease, and Alan Bostick
for most of this information.)

(This entry comes from Indiana University's UCS Knowledge Base.)

3.3) How can I tell how many newsgroups an article was posted to?

For people who can't use the classic "grepping the newsspool" method,
nn or nngrab may be able to help. (The following is adapted from a
posting by Lee Rudolph--thanks.)

You can force the Unix newsreader nn to ignore your .newsrc and create
a "merged newsgroup" consisting only of articles containing a certain
word in their subject line. For instance, to gather all articles at
your site containing the word "spam" in their subject line, use this
command:

  % nngrab spam

That's basically a faster version of

  % nn -i -s"spam" -mXx

Caution: this latter method can be a long, tedious process. See the nn
man page for more details.

3.4) OK, I'm certain it's spam. Who should I mail-bomb?

Don't mail-bomb anybody. Harrassment is illegal everywhere. If
somebody's done something truly evil, they'll get enough single
responses from individuals to acheive the same effect.

3.5) OK, I'm certain it's spam. What should I do?

* Check n.a.n-a.announce. If somebody's already made a definitive
spotting, there's no sense in an "I've seen it, too" post.

* Include a *complete* header from one copy of the spam in your post
to n.a.n-a.announce. Set followups to n.a.n-a.misc.

* Say how many newsgroups at your site it was posted to; list 20 or
more of them. (See "How do I know how many newsgroups an article was
posted to?")

* Complain politely to the spammer and the Usenet administrator at the
spammer's site (whose address should be "usenet@site.name"; if that
fails, try "postmaster@site.name".) Request that the Usenet
administrator post a response to n.a.n-a.anounce, detailing what
actions have been taken.

3.6) What about e-mail spam?

You can always complain about unsolicited e-mail to both the bozo that
sent it to you and the bozo's postmaster. To write to a postmaster,
just substitute the perp's username in their address (e.g.,
bozo@otherwise.lovely.com) with "postmaster" (i.e.,
postmaster@otherwise.lovely.com.) Please be brief and polite with the
postmasters, include a copy of the e-mail you received, and leave the
subject-line intact (in case the postmaster wants to set up an
auto-responder.)

3.7) I e-mailed a complaint to so-and-so about their {post, mail}, and
now they're threatening to complain to my system administrator. What
should I do?

Let your sys-admin know right away what's happening. Tell them the
story, briefly. [Include the post(s) in question?] Then keep them
updated on any further threats.

If you're brief, polite, and on the right side, you can usually find
an ally in your sys-admin.

3.8) What is a cancel-bot?

First off, "cancel-bot" is an unfortunate misnomer, and one that the
conventional media have understandably misunderstood. "bot" implies
that something is out there, running unattended, cancelling whatever
meets its nefarious qualifications... But this author knows of *no*
automated cancel programs in use against any type of Usenet postings,
and has never heard of such a program. All spam-cancels are sent out
manually and deliberately by actual human beings. (They happen to use
a program that is commonly referred to as a "cancel-bot".)

A cancel-bot is a program that sends out cancel messages; you feed it
the message-IDs of posts, and it sends out a cancel message for each
one (see RFC 1036.) Cancel messages are normally sent out by a
newsreader in response to a user's request to cancel a message, using
a newsreader command, *if* the user was also the original poster of
the message. Sites will ignore cancel messages that don't appear to
come from the original poster.  Cancel-bots work around this
restriction by using header lines that make it look like the original
poster sent out the cancel; they'll usually add something like a
"Cancelled-By" header line as well, to keep things nominally
above-board.

Use of a cancel-bot against anything besides 'consensus spam' outrages
people, as it should. See alt.religion.scientology for sample
discussions.

3.9) Where can I get me a cancel-bot?

If you have to ask, you should probably wait a while. ;}

3.10) How do the spam-cancellers cancel spam?

   * They make bloody sure they know how to use their cancel-bot;
   * They confirm the spam themselves;
   * They announce their action to n.a.n-a.announce. This prevents
     everyone from waiting around and wondering whether anyone's done
     anything.

Here's a standard section from a cancel-notification post by the
beloved Cancelmoose(TM):

  The $alz cancel. and Path: cyberspam conventions were followed.  [The
  $alz convention is to create your cancel message-ID by prepending
  'cancel.' to the original one.  The cyberspam convention is to use-
  'Path: cyberspam!usenet' so that sites that do not want your cancels
  can easily opt out.  Please use these when cancelling spam.]

3.11) Can I sick The Man on these MAKE.MONEY.FAST losers?

Americans can complain about e-mail or Usenet pyramid schemes to the
FTC:

  STAFF CONTACT:      Bureau of Consumer Protection
                      David Medine, 202-326-3224
                      david.medine@wpo.ftc.gov

                      Jeffrey S. Markowitz, 202-327-2460
                      jeffery.markowitz@wpo.ftc.gov

Before doing so, consider seriously whether you actually want to
encourage government intervention. The number of 'net cases the FTC
has been involved in is very low at this point; in an ideal world, it
would probably remain that way.

4.1) I hate net-cops like you people.

Who will watch the watchmen? net-cop.cops like this,
apparently. ;} Anyways, anyone who wanted to police the net would be a
pig-headed, unrealistic fool. Thankfully, we just want to shoot spam
out of the sky, because

  * We hate it, 
  * It feels good, and
  * We can.

Anyways, if you don't like spam being cancelled at your site, you can
have your upstream feeds alias your site to "cyberspam".

4.2) Hey, I think my group's being invaded by alt.syntax.tactical!

We're sorry. Please don't bring that subject up again here. Good
luck... Keith "Justified and Ancient" Cochran, who has been wrongfully
accused of a.s.t involvement himself, adds: "I would suggest the first
thing you do is take a chill pill." (Note that there is no second
thing to do. However, you may want to pass the time reading the
alt.bigfoot FAQ:

  http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/bigfoot/top.html

--particularly the part about cats.)

4.3) Hey, somebody posted an ad in {newsgroup}!

So? 

Alright, alright: first, check to see if the post was obviously forged
(see "How can I spot a forgery?")

Then check to see if it's spam (see "What is Spam" and "How do I know
when I've got spam on my hands?") It's probably not. We only want to
hear about it if it's spam.

If the ad is off-topic, and you really can't let it go, check out the
advice in "Hey, so-and-so's not being nice in {newsgroup}!"

4.4) Hey, so-and-so's not being nice in {newsgroup}!

Happens all the time. We don't want to hear about it. However, here
are some things you can do (written by Keith "Justified and Ancient"
Cochran):

"The first thing to do is take it up with user@some.site.  If you
can't achieve a mutual understanding, then you _MIGHT_ (note, not
WILL, _MIGHT_) want to mail postmaster@some.site with your complaint.
If you are going to write to postmaster@some.site, be sure to include
the full, unedited post you have a problem with, a short but
descriptive summary of why you have a problem with it, and a short,
but descriptive explanation of what you would like to have happen.

"Note that this does not apply to MAKE.MONEY.FAST.  If you see a copy
of M.M.F, just e-mail postmaster@some.site, including the article ID,
and the first paragraph of the post."

4.5) Hey, one of those net.cops posted an ad for <something>! Haw! Haw!

     ad != spam

APPENDIX
========

news.admin.misc charter:

   news.admin.net-abuse.misc is for the discussion of possible abuses
   of netnews and e-mail. It is for the discussion of standards of net
   abuse, to suggest appropriate courses of action (if any) to net
   abuse and to post reports of alleged occurrences of net
   abuse. Relevant topics include events associated with net abuse
   such as: spamming (posting many individual copies of any article),
   excessive crossposting of non-germane articles, injection of
   malformed articles into the news system (broken gateways, for
   example), or other forms of "roboposting" involving large numbers
   of postings to one or more groups, forging identity of postings,
   forged approval to moderated groups, forged cancellation of
   articles including cancellation of net abuse articles, use of
   rmgroup/newgroup in an abusive manner, large-scale mailings to
   mailing lists or other mail-bombing, deciding what isn't net abuse,
   general issues of netiquette, methods for resolving conflicts,
   proposed blacklists and boycotts, "renegade" sites, etc.  Postings
   include news reports, reviews, and conferences, and net-abuse FAQs.
   Although commercial posts are not inherently net-abuse, proper
   methods of posting commercial material are within the scope of this
   group.

news.admin.net-abuse.announce charter and guidelines:


   news.admin.net-abuse.announce Charter and Guidelines
   
   1. What topics are relevant to this group? Events associated with net
      abuse, such as:
      - posting many individual copies of any article.
      Or, excessive crossposting of non-germane articles.
      - injection of malformed articles into the news system (broken
      gateways, for example), or other forms of "roboposting" involving
      large numbers of postings to one or more groups.
      - Forging identity of postings
      - Forged approval to moderated groups
      - Forged cancellation of articles not included above.  Note that
        cancellation of net abuse articles is also relevant to the
        topic of net abuse.
      - Use of rmgroup/newgroup in an abusive manner
      - large-scale mailings to mailing lists or other mail-bombing
   
      Postings to this group may also include announcements relevant
      to the topic of net abuse, such as news reports, reviews, and
      conferences, and possible net-abuse FAQs.
   
      The purpose of this group is not to decide the guilt or
      innocence of any parties, but rather to simply report on the
      activity (much like the crime section found in many local
      newspapers).  It must be kept clear that the net is a new legal
      area, but it is also one with a lot of unwritten rules.  The
      moderators are in no way are attempting to act as judges,
      lawyers, or mediators.
   
   2. Posting of reports of this kind of activity in no way implies
      that net-wide cancellation of such articles are to be
      encouraged.  How local news admins deal with such incidents is
      strictly up to them.  The moderators of this group should not be
      held responsible for actions taken by others in response to
      articles posted to news.admin.net-abuse.announce.
   
   3. No moderator will engage in the following activities:

      - cancellation of any posts other than ones posted by them,
        excepting articles with forged approval to newsgroups they
        moderate or, if they are a news admin, posts originating from
        their site (following the local site's procedures).
      - Sending of "mailbombs", threats, abusive e-mail, or other
        attacks in response to alleged net abuse.
   
   4. We are committed to providing accurate information regarding
      events related to net abuse (with emphasis on Usenet) in a
      timely manner.  However, as we the moderators must often rely on
      the reports of others, whenever we have not confirmed a report
      ourselves we will state so in the posting.
   
   5. Right of Reply. If posts have been made in this group concerning
      an individual's alleged net abuse and the individual and/or site
      from which it originated have suffered negative consequences in
      the form of articles cancelled, accounts cancelled, or
      substantial negative email; then the individual and site each
      have the right to one (but no more than one) reply for the
      purpose of justification, rebuttal, or reports of actions taken
      to correct or cancel the alleged abuse.
   
   6. Examples of inappropriate postings:
      - redundant reports of events
      - Trivial events, for example "Hey, this guy posted an ad to
        comp.sys.xyz!"
   
   7. Administravia
      - Approval of postings will be made by a team of moderators.
      - Change of moderators will be made by majority.  Forcible removal
        of a moderator will be by consensus of remaining moderators.
      - Any rule changes will be made by majority of the moderators.
   
   Initial moderators:
   David Barr <barr@math.psu.edu>
   Joel Furr <jfurr@acpub.duke.edu>
   Paul Phillips <paulp@CERF.NET>
   Abby Franquemont-Guillory <abbyfg@tezcat.com>
