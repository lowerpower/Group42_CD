--------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Where can I find currently published books?

The United States's most complete bookstore is the combination of BOOKS IN
PRINT and the U. S. Post Office.  BIP will tell you the price and the
publisher's address.  Send them a check for the price and they will be happy
to send you the book.  We do it all the time.  Some publishers grudgingly
send a note with the book saying "Next time please include N% for postage
and handling," but that is unusual.  Nobody has ever refused to send the
book and at least once they sent a check with the book because if ordered
direct, they gave a discount.  We rarely order through a bookstore because
it is so much easier to order the book and have it sent to us directly.
(This is probably not true for mass-market paperbacks where the handling
charges would be more than the book!)

What is BOOKS IN PRINT?

Just about every public library and every bookstore in the country has, for
public use, a multi-volume reference work called "Books in Print."  It is
just about what the title claims it is.  It is a listing by title, by
author, and by subject of every book currently listed by publishers as being
currently in print in the United States.  (There may be editions for other
countries as well.)  It tells you the list price and the publisher.  It also
has a volume of out-of-print books and a separate volume that lists the
mailing addresses of the publishers.  The local B. Dalton keeps it at the
information desk.  Almost any bookstore or public library will have a set that
they would be happy to have you look at.

There is a similar reference set called "Paperback Books in Print."  I am
not sure what it would list that would not be listed in its bigger cousin,
but that reference might also be of interest.  In Britain, there is "British
Books in Print."

2) Where can I find out-of-print books?

If you just want to borrow it, ask your library about inter-library
loans--chances are good they can find it for you in a library they have
reciprocal agreements with even if they don't have it themselves.

For used books, there is BOOKMAN'S, the used book trade magazine.  Lots
of books are advertised there that haven't been in print for decades.
You may be able to find the annual bound copy of BOOKMAN'S PRICE INDEX
(the used book dealer's pricing bible) in your local library.  There's
no guarantee that the book you want will still be for sale if you go
that way, but it is a good way to plan your budget.

Most used book stores participate in an informal network (not a computer
network) of clearinghouses on information about used books.  It is usually
possible within a few days to locate copies of used books with indications
of their condition. The service usually costs between nothing and two
dollars a book.

One way of getting out-of-print titles is to get in touch with
University Microfilms, Inc. (or other such companies).  They'll
print a copy of a book from microfilm, generally within 3 weeks
of your order.  They take care of the copyright issues &#38; royalty
payments, and you get the book (although the printing quality is
what you'd expect for a photoreprint from microfilm). They're a
standard resource for librarians.  A 106-page book was recently
quoted as US$30.00, with a US$6.00 surcharge for cloth binding
(default is paperbound) - another example of the pricing is a
1970 book, currently out of print, about 350 pages, quoted at
$150 -  so be sure to check with the company.  And of course, not
all books are available for reprinting--they've obviously
specialized in academic books.

As a last resort, out of print US Government literature may be 
requested from microfiche copy from the NTIS. Considering the 
source media is microfiche, these can be fairly good quality 
reproductions. This method can be expensive (NTIS does not publish 
a rate table, but a fair starting guess is US$0.10/page). The NTIS 
will offer discounts for orders of multiple copies (i.e. 25% for 5 
or more).

3) How can I access On-line university catalogs and the Library of Congress
   catalog through internet?

The lists of online library catalogs are available for anonymous 
ftp on ftp.unt.edu, in the directory library. Read the aaareadme.txt file 
for an index. The file you probably need is libraries.txt or libraries.ps
From this list, you can get the directions for accessing the on-line
catalog of the university nearest you.

One extensive university catalog accessible by telnet:  

The University of California
MELVYL Catalog
melvyl.ucop.edu or
31.1.0.1, 31.0.0.11, 31.0.0.13, 31.1.0.11 
for journals and books.

The Library of Congress catalog is dra.com or  192.65.218.43
I have heard it is not comprehensive, and not as big as MELVYL.

6) What is the ISSN?

The format of an ISSN is nnnn-nnnc, where c is a check digit.

The ISSN is a sequentially computer generated number, which has no
publisher link as with ISBNs.  A serial is assigned the next number to
come up in the sequence regardless of publisher.

In the U.S. they are allocated by the Library of Congress, the same
department that registers copyrights.

In the UK, the people responsible are The British Library at Boston Spa -

The British Library, ISSN UK CENTRE, Boston Spa, Wetherby, 
    West Yorkshire, LS23 7BQ, UK.
