<h2>Hacking Renegade BBS Systems</h2>
by Redwoods of Group 42
<p>

Renegade is one of the more common BBS systems being used.  Renegade
is a hack of Telegaurd, and in the conversion the authors left a
bug that can allow you access to the renegade data files, user data
files, and the chat logs.  All you need is a Renegade Mock Setup and
to follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Dial your target Renegade BSS.
<li>Logon.  It is advised that you use a fake account and deleting the
        logs when you're done.
<li>After you logon, make sure the sysop is not around.  Check the
        messages, play some door games to make it look normal.  Page
        the sysop to see if he's around.  The best time to do this is
        very late a night when the sysop is asleep.
<li>When ready, goto the file menu.
<li>In the file menu there is an option called <b>/A</b>.  This is
        the archive menu.  This is where you will do your work on
        compressed files and where you will do your hacking.
<li>From the archive menu select <b>W</b> to work on a file.
<li>Enter the name of the archive you wish to work on.  This can be
        any name followed by the extension of the file.  <b>.zip</b>
        is the best as most systems support it.  What you will be doing
        is adding the data files to a .zip file for later download.
<li>Now you have to add your files.  You hit <b>A</b> to do this.  When
        it prompts you for files type <b>../../u*.dat</b>.  Next
        type <b>../../r*.dat</b>. And finally type <b>../../*.log</b>.
<li>Now you have the data files and the chat logs in the archive.  You
        may now download the file which you have created.
<li>Once you have the files you need to set up a mock Renegade BBS to
        view the files.
<li>Copy the renegade.dat to your main renegade directory and copy the
        user files to x:\renegade\data, or whatever your renegade data
        directory is.
<li>Start renegade using <b>renegade /l</b> to startup renegade in its
        local mode.
<li>Goto the user setup and start writing down passwords.  System passwords
        are found in the system config section.  You can logon as the
        sysop, but to do so you will need his phone number, passowrd and
        the system password.  You can loook at the <b>renegade.dat</b>
        file and find pards of passwords as well.
