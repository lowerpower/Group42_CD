[The opener] uses a 555 timer as a pulse generator to transmit pulses to a
binary counter.  Each pulse will increment the binary counter by one.  You can
adjust the speed of the counting by turning R1.  Go ahead and experiment to
find just the right speed to use.  Switch one is for resetting the count back
to the beginning.
<p>
As you may notice, the <a href="garage.gif">schematics</a>
don't show how to connect directly to the
garage door opener. What I do is this: First you must desolder the DIP
switches from the door opener and solder an IC socket into where the DIP
switches were.  (This will allow you to put the DIPswitches back, when
operating in normal mode.) Second, you should connect the output to a wirewrap
IC socket.  If you mount the IC socket on your pc or perfboard you can use the
socket to plug right in to the door opener.  When connecting the output, be
sure that the connectionson the wirewrap socket correspond to the ON setting
of the DIP switches.
