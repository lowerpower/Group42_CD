Does your school have a bunch of a Apple IIs hooked up to a Corvis?
Well, if they do, this is for you.
<p>
If you want all the accounts and passwords all you have to do is follow
these simple instructions.  First when it prompts you for your ID,
simply hit ctrl-reset a few times.  You should now have an Applesoft
Basic prompt.  Now type in this one line program:<p>
<ul>
10 FOR I=6281 TO 7252:PRINT CHR$(PEEK(I));:NEXT I
</ul>
<br>
Now that you have that typed in, RUN it.  The program should dump all the
passwords onto the screen.  User names are usually to to four characters
long.  Passwords are two characters long.  Also, disregard any punctuation
followint a password.
<p>
Let's say you had some output that looked like this:
<b>... P1 P2 TYIPXX P3...</b>
The <b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b> would be user ID's that require no passwords.  The
<b>TYIPXX</b> would be the user id <b>TYIP</b> and the password <b>XX</b>.
<b>P3</b>
would be the same as <b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b>.
<p>
That's the basics of Hacking Corvis Constellation.  Until next time have
phun and hack on.<p>
