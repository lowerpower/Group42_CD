a new modem, hard drive or just get some CD's. These days, as most
of you already know, carding is getting more and more dangerous every
day. Stores are getting even more strict with their "Over the phone 
credit card orders". So some people have stopped carding... and 
others... well they try their luck with those 1-900-909-SEXX lines.

    We all hear about thoes party lines and live girls that don't
charge to your phone bill, but to your credit card. And alot of
people actually call them using someone elses credit cards. Now,
most of us think, 'Oh don't worry, it just a cheap party line, who
cares?'.. well the credit agencies do. Over 70% of all those party
lines have tracers, and/or they are out-call services (they call you
back). When you call them, 2 things can happen...

1. If you have all the real info on the credit card:
  a. Address
  b. Real name
  c. Full phone number
  d. City, State
  e. Zip code
  f. Social Sec. # (Sometimes)
  g. Birthdate
  h. Expir. date

Once the real card holder gets the bill he will call his credit
card company and complain. They will call the party line and
find the records of the call back number and call you, and then
you are in deep shit.

or 2. If you only have the card number and exp date, and you
make up the rest, they (the party line) will find out you are
full of crap and call a credit card fraud department and they 
will start a semi/full investigation.

  Either way you are fucked if the party line keeps a record
of the out calls... so, you will end up getting a call from
a laywer, or investigator for a Fraud Department about that
incident. The best thing to do is denie the whole thing, just
say you don't know shit about it. Cause if you admit it, you
will have to pay the bill and a fine, and if you are a minor,
you will possibly have to go to juvinal hall or if you are
an adult, you will have to face jail. Don't forget boys and
girls, Credit card fraud it a major offense.

   So, just act cool and things should go well, and make sure
you throw away or burn anything that has any proof that you 
had any card numbers at all, and make sure you make them think
you know absolutly NOTHING about carding...

   Remeber, I am not saying not to call them, just make sure
they aren't "Out-Call sevices" and there is no warning of
tracing on their messages to the caller. Have phun, latr!
