
 Well, here I am again for another Legions of Lucifer Anarchy file.
This one has to do with SCHOOL! Argh... Most of us go to that terrible
place so adults can throw useless information at us in great quantities
that they expect us to memorize. And they do this for a full 9 months!!
Now most of us just sit there and take it all... I say FUCK THAT! Get up
off of your butts and do somthing.. have a little phun. Adults put kids in
school to keep us off the streets and out of trouble.. But no one ever said
we can't have fun and cause trouble in school! That's where this text file
comes in handy. This will give you some ideas on how to have more phun in
school. Part 1, being this file, deals with non-destructive and mildly mean
things to do. BUT part 2 will have the mean and destructive ideas... So until
you get & read part 2, this will just have to do....


 Things to do with an eraser...
1. Hide it in the 'Class Idiot's desk.
2. Super Glue it to the teachers desk.
3. Put tape on the side that erases... the teacher will try SO
   fucking hard to erase the board, he/she will go nuts!
4. Tape a Snap-Pop to the erasing side. When the teacher trys to
   erase the board... *POW!* Scares the shit out of them!
5. Put animal guts all over it!
6. Put rubber cemment on the side you hold it on... when the teacher
   grabs the eraser.. Haha

 Things to do with Super Glue... (If you get strong glue this stuff

   to take off w/o Alcohol.
9. If you have the type of teacher that buys coffee at 7-11 or
   AM-PM, then the cup will be made from Styro-Foam... Glue the
   base of the cup to the desk. When tries to pick up the cup, it
   will rip the cup in half, and he will get Coffee EVERYWHERE!
