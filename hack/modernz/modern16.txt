   The normal no responsibility message has been in all

the previous files, so if you haven't noticed it before, 

go back and read it...it correspinds to this and all future

files from me.

***********************************************************

    Generally state, screen codes are what both the telephone

switching office and the phone itself send and and verify one

another on each phone line.  That is that should you attempt

to use a pay phone on a regular phone line (your's, though

preferably someone else's) it will still ask for money. Also

should you attempt to use your phone on a pay phone line it

will register as a pay phone (or at least some similar screen

code...usually appearing on the line as possible screened line

and in that case it tells the operator not to bill to the line.)

     However these codes can be modified on the phone so as to

appear as something else.  The belief is that the phone company

has a flag on the line to see if it recieves some screen code. 

But the screen codes as following including hotels and businesses, 

some of which can direct dial with no problem (well on a hotel 

an operator will come on the line asking which room to bill to...

pick any number.)  There are also hospitals which will allow

you to bill to a third party without voice verification (a rule

that in parts of New York and all of New Jersey, the AT&T operator

must voice verify all third party calls except from hospitals,

other Long Distance services have done this for a long time.)

    Note that the description of the code is related to the LD

service it belongs to (This list is from AT&T), however the codes

will still be there, just corresponding to something else.  Note

that some screen codes when transfered from one service to another

will vanish and appear as a non-coin/private phone.  This is the

reason for the transferring operator phrase of :


"This is the [fill in the blank] operator with a trasnfer call. 
 Note that the call call can not be billed to the originating
 station...." 
  
However do to the violent competition between the companies the

younger operators can be convinced to "forget" to announce

themselves as a transfer.

   And now with that background, away we go.........
