	Well as you may have noticed in the previous phile

I put the advertisement in for Hellfire BBS.  Well the 

reason for that will now become apparant.

	Modernz has officially become an ally with SANctuary, and you can see both packaged other SANPHILES currently.  It is not a merger because we do solely different fields within the topic so are a seperate entity working along side of them.

	We will continue with this title in the interest of bringing you the best, the most interesting, and

the most downright acid influenced bits of telecommunication

data.
	Welp, what more can I say?!?  greets to all I know,

and all I hope to trash before I meet.

	Be prepared to see us a lot more frequently in the 

future as topics are now coming in faster than I can compile 

them.  If you have any topics you wish to see explored please contact us with such, we will be glad to help.


	This goes out to all the FEDS out there...
