Title : modernz vs tanj

This message is to announce that henceforth and forevermore, Digital-demon is
the sole caretaker & owner of the "modern??.???" textfiles. Phoenix Modernz is 
no longer using this title,and since Digital-demon has written the bulk of
these files,it is in recognition of his contributions that I give the filename 
to him.

Modernz publications will,in the future,use a title of "tanj.???", which means 
"There Ain't No Justice". The first of these files will be in the directories
of this & hopefully many other bbs's by morning's light.

			     -How to host a bust-

	Hiya... now, alot of you have probably never heard of me, or the

organization I founded back in 1989. Panther Modernz started out as a small H/P

group, mostly commodore users in the central Jersey area. As time went by, we

either dropped out, or eventually went IBM. None of this has anything to do with

the main thrust of this file, except to say that we were there.

	In any case,back on May 30, 1991, I was busted. Now, I guess everyone in

their own mind has visions of how it will come to pass, but I must admit, I was

disappointed. I was just sitting at home, and had FINALLY gotten some offline

mail utility configured for my BBS, when there is this knock on the door....

I go answer it, thinking nothing out of the ordinary. Three suits and a half

dozen uniforms are outside the door. (Still no alarms going off inside, proving

my own hypothesis that only the stupid get caught). They push their way in,

handing me a warrant and explaining that they are here to search my apartment

for computers & telephone equipment. Now, at this point, my brain is in a

whirl... "Oh god," I am thinking, "now what the fuck am I gonna do?".

	The suits identify themselves as Mr. (unintelligible) from US Sprint and

a pair of local detectives, which causes me to sigh a bit... local cops means

no major investigation. Anyway, the uniforms split up, searching such highly

obvious places as my bathroom and my jacket pockets for computers. The same

geniuses search my room tooth and nail, failing to find any of the 4 disks

scattered in plain view, nor the old radio shack tone dialer that was in a

drawer that they dumped out on my bed. They DID find a small bag of catnip,

which they advised me to dispose of before I got into more trouble than I

already was. I told them that it was catnip, and that they were welcome to

take it and have it analyzed. One of the detectives took it and threw it

away for me. How nice.

	Next came the best part... the part where the cops disassemble and label

all the parts of your computer system. They were doing okay until they hit my

commodore 128D setup, and I literally had to stand over them to insure that

they A) Didn't break anything or B) got the names of everything right. The

total ignorance of the police when it comes to computers is astonishing

enough, but their "expert" from US Sprint was even worse. He tried labelling

my TurboCPU as a modem, and thought my external HardDrive was a floppy.

They even took the VCR I had hooked up to the Commodore's monitor simply

because it was connected to something the computer was connected to. I guess

they're busy watching porn tapes on it now...

	Now, as far as hosting a bust goes, here are some basic tips. If anyone

of the officers who come to visit smoke, ask them NICELY to extinguish their

cigarettes or step outside with them. (If you have police in your house, you

are in enough shit without obviously trying to antagonize them!). When they

were disassembling my IBM setup, they also unplugged the air conditioner. I

saw no need to plug it back in. Let the fuckers sweat. I also got myself

something to drink, and made it obvious that they were welcome to go back to

the donut shop if they got thirsty. Cops are a nervous lot, so if you can,

try to stand over them, supervising their every move, and make absolutely

sure they mark everything down right. And don't answer questions about

ANYTHING! And don't lead them to anything, either. The idiots who searched

my place left so much shit behind that I almost did start believeing there

was a god, after all...

	The police also tend to underestimate the time it will take them to

figure out what it is that you might have done. The detectives who visited me

told me they'd be back to me the next day to process me. When it finally came

to pass, it was five months later that they finally did book me. Its now three

months later and I still don't have a court date.

	Some things to think of: the US Sprint guy who visited me considered

my printout of Internet sites to be a piece of classified material. He seemed

genuinely happy to find such an incriminating document. He also read every

piece of online mail I had on my system. Online mail has been afforded the

same rights as US Postal mail in many states... so he might well have

committed a felony right before my eyes. The 4th amendment guarentees the

rights of citizens against UNREASONABLE search and seizure. I don't dispute

their right to search, but for what they were lookimg for, copies of my

software would have been sufficient. Taking it may well be decided in court

to be a violation of my rights. The 1st amendment guarentees the rights of

all citizens to assemble. By taking the two computers I was running BBS's on,

the cops may well be found to have placed a prior restriction to free speech

on my users. This too may be a useful argument in court.

	Another thing of note is that the terms you and I take for granted are

all the same to the gendarmes. I was asked what program I used to "hack" with.

Now, I don't know about you, but I don't "hack" via any program more complicated

than procomm. I deduced that he meant wardialling, and tried to educate him

on the difference, but it was useless. When dealing with the authorities, you

are often going to find yourself wondering if they can really be this stupid.

	This is my first file in ages. TANJ is a new direction for me, and I am

hoping to go beyond "just" telecom oriented textfiles. Look for future releases later

in 1992.
