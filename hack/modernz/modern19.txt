	This is our first issue as a SANphile so of course

I'd like to go into a little background and greetings.  The

Panther Modernz started as a small group devoted to 

information gathering in the known networks  (also known as

hacking to most people.)  We were actually just a loosely 

held together group of friends who decided to learn from

one another...  Well as you can see as a group we never

wen't very far...as we were still mainly freelancing.  Our

group grew with leaps and bounds, through no knowledge of

the main group.  Just people from all over started claiming

to be memebers of ours, and mainly giving us a bad image.

so it was decided that it would be best for all of us to go

our seperate ways.  

	Okay, and as for the san history.. well, umm... good

question...guess I gotta ask someone some time.
