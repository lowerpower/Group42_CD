    ==============================

    A nondisplayable key used by the operator on an IBM 3270 terminal to   
    gain the attention of the 3270 application program. The AID key serves 
    two read functions: short read, which requests immediate action from   
    the application program (host), and long read, which enables the       
    operator to send data to the application.
