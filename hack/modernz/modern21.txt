    background process                                                         
    ==================

    A scheduled job used for tasks requiring a large amount of processing  
    time in an ISIS node. The background process is the level at which the 
    bulk of the processing is done and is given long periods of time at    
    irregular intervals. Background processes are executed when no         
    foreground (real time) processes are due to run and can be interrupted 
    by a foreground task. Also called background job.                      
    Contrast with foreground.

    =========

    A printed circuit board with pin connectors on the back to accommodate 
    buses, jumpers, and/or terminator boards; the front of the board allows
    system control boards to be plugged into it. The backplane provides the
    means for interboard communication. There are a variety of backplane   
    architectures; BT North America uses two: BT North America propriety   
    backplane design (for the Engine family) and the VMEbus (for the       
    Turbo Engine).

    ============

    The process by which data flow (in one direction, on an individual     
    virtual circuit) is temporarily stopped.                               


    backward channel

    An error condition on a link when a frame has been received with an    
    invalid ACK field.

    ========

    An error condition on a synchronous line in which the first few bits of
    a potential frame do not match any valid BORI. See Beginning-of-Record 
    Indicator (BORI).

    an invalid frame (record) number.                                      


    ball logic                                                                 
    ==========

    The use of BT North America-specific, end-to-end messages signaling    
    specific virtual circuit conditions. This convention of individual     
    signals can be used if both ends agree on the alternate protocol. The  
    TYMNET network uses the following ball messages: Black Ball, Glass     
    Ball, Gray Ball, Green Ball, Orange Ball, Red Ball; each is defined    
    in this glossary.

    Basic Bisync Extension-cord Service (BBXS)                                 
    ==========================================

    Now called RJE/HASP Service, this service allows 2780/3780/HASP        
    devices to remotely access hosts over packet-switching networks.       
    Can be configured as a TIF or a HIF. Also called Remote Job Entry      
    (RJE) interface. Although the name of this service has changed, the    
    product ID remains BBXS.                                               


    Basic Rate Interface (BRI)                                                 
    ==========================

    An interface to Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), used for   
    individual subscriber terminal equipment. The BRI uses a medium-speed  
    digital connection of 144 kbps to provide 2 B-channels and 1 D-channel.
    The B-channels (bearer channels) operate at 64 kbps and carry voice,   
    circuit-switched data, and packetized data. The D-channel (signaling   
    channel) operates at 16 kbps and carries signaling for all B- and      
    D-channels, and packetized data. See Primary Rate Interface.           


    Basic Telecommunications

    =========

    The rate of speed (number of times) per second a signal is altered.    
    The number of bits represented by a baud depends on the encoding       
    technique. If each baud represents one bit condition, the baud rate    
    equals bits per second (bps).

    ============

    A protocol that can convey control information based on the value and  
    position of a single bit. This bit pattern represents a flag           
    character, which separates distinct groups of data bits.  Sometimes    
    referred to as bit-and-position-oriented. Examples of this protocol    
    are HDLC and SDLC link-level protocols.

    Binary Image Transport System. A program that provides down-line       
    loading and dumping. Used to transfer files between a UNIX host and    
    computer and a target Engine or Turbo Engine. BITS replaces the Engine 
    LOAD-II, Engine Load Facility (ELF), and Merge and Link ISIS Nodes     
    (MERLIN) facilities.

    =====================

    The basic unit of rate measurement in data communications. The rate at 
    which bits are represented over an analog or digital communications    
    path. Bits per second is an information transfer rate, as opposed to   
    baud, which is a signaling rate.

    Basic Rate Interface. An interface to Integrated Services Digital      
    Network (ISDN), used for individual subscriber terminal equipment.     
    The BRI uses a medium-speed digital connection of 144 kbps to provide  
    2 B-channels and 1 D-channel. The B-channels (bearer channels) operate 
    at 64 kbps and carry voice, circuit-switched data, and packetized data.
    The D-channel (signaling channel) operates at 16 kbps and carries      
    signaling for all B- and D-channels, and packetized data.

    ======

    A connected device that permits communications between Local Area      
    Networks (LANs) supporting similar protocols, which are logically or   
    physically separated from each other.  For example, using ring

    ======

    The process by which a TYM2 link acquires additional channels to       
    accommodate new circuits. This is accomplished by assigning additional 
    addresses for routing individual circuits across the link. A bubble    
    expands a link in increments of 128 channels. This method of link-level
    traffic management is similar to Statistical Time Division             
    Multiplexing. Contrast with shrink.

    ==========

    A traffic condition that forces Node Code to reallocate the memory     
    buffers of the largest user, due to traffic requirements. This results 
    in the user losing data and the initiation of a Black Ball message in  
    the direction of the data loss.

    A 16-byte area of memory in Node Code where buffered data is stored    
    (short term). The 16-byte area of memory contains 14 bytes of data     
    and a 2-byte pointer to the next bufferlet.

    ====

    A group of consecutive binary digits recognized as one unit by a
