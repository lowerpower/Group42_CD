    A high-level programming language for writing systems software. The    
    UNIX operating system was written using the C language. C language     
    reduces source code length, which could possibly reduce object code    
    size.

    =======

    An analog signal (at a fixed amplitude and frequency) combined with    
    an information signal in a modulation process producing a signal for   
    transmission. A carrier provides sufficient power so that a signal     
    can be reliably detected at some other point or points. Modulation     
    makes a more powerful signal. The term carrier may refer to this       
    powerful signal either before or (more commonly) after modulation.     
    Also called carrier wave or carrier frequency.

    ============================================================

    A method for handling network access of several stations on a Local    
    Area Network (LAN). Collision Detection (CD) is a refinement of this   
    method whereby a station on a LAN detects and compensates for the      
    undesirable collisions that could mix data when several stations try   
    to transmit simultaneously.
