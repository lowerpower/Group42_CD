			       -Words to Live By-

Over the years,I have collected a series of quotes about various things that I
thought I might share with the world...some of them are sensible,some are not.
Pick what you like...its your life, eh?

Courage is the complement of fear.A man who is fearless cannot be courageous.
He is also a fool.

The truth of a proposition has nothing to do with its credibility,and vice
versa.

Beware of altruism.It is based on self deception,the root of all evil.

Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.

Does history record ANY case in which the majority was right?

Never frighten a little man.He'll kill you.

The greatest productive force is human selfishness.

Sin is best defined as hurting other people.Hurting oneself isn't sin,its just
stupid.

Thou shalt not alter thy brothers consciousness without his consent.

I must not fear.Fear is the mind killer.It is the little death that brings
total obliteration.I will face my fear,permit it to pass over and through
me.And when it has gone past,I will turn my inner eye to see its path.Where
the fear has gone will be nothing.Only I will remain.

Mankind is without a doubt the most conceited species in the universe.What
other race believes god has nothing better to do than to sit around all day
and help him out of tight spots?

Get a shot off FAST...this'll upset him long enough to let you make shot #2
perfect.

It may be better to be a dead lion than a live jackal,but it is better still
to be a live lion.And usually easier.

A motion to adjourn is always in order.

Your enemy is never a villan in his own eye.Keeping this in mind can help to
make a friend of him.If not,you can kill him without hate,and quickly.

You can have peace.Or you can have freedom.Don't count on having both at the
same time.

Democracy is based on the assumption that a million men are wiser than one man.
How's that again? I missed something.

Autocracy is based on the assumption that one man is wiser than a million men.
Lets play that over again,too.Who decides?

If you can't convince them,confuse them.

In case of doubt,make it sound convincing.

When in doubt,mumble.When in trouble,delegate.

Friends come and go.Enemies accumulate.

if you're feeling pretty good,don't worrry.You'll get over it.

If everything seems to be going well,you obviously don't know what the hell is
going on.

Do unto others...then split.

The human mind is a fantasy land operating to delude itself by assuming
whatever point of view is easiest to live with.

Thou shalt not disfigure the soul.

He's dead,and I'm alive,and thats the way I wanted it to be.

When in charge,ponder.

"Shon'ai Sa'jiran" : The cast is made,we must now live with the consequences.

You'll find anything in the last place you look.

A man who WON'T be blackmailed,CAN'T be blackmailed.

There is a theory that states that if anyone ever discovers exactly what the
Universe is for and why it is here,it will instantaneously disappear and be
replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.

There is another theory which states that the above has already happened.TWICE.

In the beginning,the universe was created.This has made alot of people very
angry and has been generally regarded as a bad idea.

War is the greatest of teachers,and not all of its lessons are bad.Their cost
is just so terribly high.

The three best ways to lie are to: Tell the truth,but not all of it.To tell the
truth in such a way as to convince your audience that you are in fact lying,or
to simply say nothing at all,and let them make their own conclusions.

The Agnostics Prayer:
Insofar as I may be heard by anything,which may or may not care what I say,I
ask,if it matters,that I be forgiven for anything I may have done or failed to
do which requires forgivness.Conversely,if not forgivness but something else
may be required to insure any possible benefit for which I may be eligible
after the destruction of my body,I ask that this,whatever it may be,be granted
or withheld,as the case may be,in such a way as to insure my recieving said
benefit.I ask this in my capacity as my elected intermediary between myself
and that which might not be myself,but which may have an interest in the matter
of my recieving as much of said benefit as it is possible for me to recieve of
of this thing,and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony.

It requires a very unusual mind to undertake the analysis of the obvious.

Governments aren't important in and of themselves.What they do for individuals
and for the future of the race as a whole is.

Insanity is the state of mind in which an individuals perception of the world
around himself differs signifigantly from that of the majority.But what of the
one eyed man in the land of the blind?

Shon'jir: From dark beginning
	  to dark at ending.
	  Between them a sun,
	  but after comes dark,
	  one ending.
	  From dark to dark
	  is one voyage.
	  From dark to dark
	  is our voyage.
	  And after the dark,
	  O brothers, O sisters,
	  Come we home.

Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.

The hardest thing to hide is something that is not there.

In the mirrors of the many judgements,my hands are the colr of blood.I am a
part of the evil which exists to oppose other evils.On that great day of which
the prophets speak,but in which they do not truly believe,on that day, when the
world is completely cleansed of evil,then I,too,will go down into darkness,
swallowing curses.Until that time,I shall not wash my hands,nor shall I allow
them to hang useless.

When the million applaud,ask what harm you have done.When the censure you,
what good.

Nothing has to BE true,but everything has to SOUND true.

Never allow a sense of morals to keep you from doing what is right.

When outnumbereed,attack.This drives the enemies strength towards itself.It
also scares the hell out of them.

When you are attacked,fall.Allow your enemy's strength to buffet you as a
strong wind does grass.He will soon expend himself,and you will remain,
upright.

Often,the most overpowering strategy is to do nothing at all.

Patience is a virtue best left to the dead,who can afford it.

To be idle requires a strong sense of personal identity.

When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour,it seems like a minute.
But let him sit on a hot stove for a minute,and it seems longer than any hour.
Thats relativity.

Any problem can be solved with the correct application of force.This does not
mean "Might makes Right", the operative word is CORRECT.

Nothing is so good that somebody,somewhere,won't hate it,and nothing is so bad
that someone won't love it.

The power to act confers the responsibility to do so.A true and ethical person
understands this,and will not hesitate to say "This is my responsibility and
I will accept it." Anything less is passing the buck.

They little knew of brotherhood,the faith of fighting men,
who once to prove their lie was good hanged Colonel Jaques Cretien.
One fourth of Rochmonts fighting strength,one battalion of Dorsai,
was sent by Rochmont forth alone to bleed Hulmuth and die.
But look,look down from Rochmont's height,
upon the Helmuth plain.
At all of Helmuth's armored force,
by Dorsai checked,or slain,
look down,look down on Rochmont's shame .
To hide the wrong she'd done,
made claim Helmuth had bribed Dorsais,
no battle had been won.
To prove that lie,the Rochmont lords
arrested Jaques Cretien,
on charge he'd dealt with Helmuth's chiefs,
for payment of his men.
Commandant Arp Van Din sent word:
"You may not judge Dorsai.
Return our Colonel by the dawn,
or Rochmont town will die."
Strongheld behind her walls,Rochmont
scorned to answer them,
condemned and at the daybreak,hanged,
young Colonel Jaques Cretien.
Bright,bright,the sun that morning rose,
upon each weaponed wall.
But when the sun set in the west,
those walls were leveled all.
Then soft and white the moon arose,
on streets and roofs untainted,
but when the moon was down once more,
no street or roof remained.
No more is there a Rochmont town.
No more are Rochmonts men.
But stands a Dorsai monument,
to Colonel Jaques Cretien.
So pass the word from world to world,
alone still stands Dorsai.
But while she lives,no one of hers,
by foreign wrong shall die.
Little they knew of brotherhood,the faith of fighting men.
Who once to porve their lie was good,
hanged Colonel Jaques Cretien.

Show me a completely smooth operation and I'll show you someone who's covering
mistakes.Real boats rock.

The transient and the eternal are the same.

The kzinti had learned the hard way that the reason humanity had decided to
study war no more was that humans were so very,very good at it.

Life is like a box...much in the same way that a box is like a box.You can only
get out of it exactly what you put into it.

Thats about it for this one...I will wander along again eventually with
something to babble about,or perhaps someone else will take a turn.Greets
go out to those in PM & TLS,and others who know who they are.
