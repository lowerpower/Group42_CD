 	Well I went in a little different direction for this text file but it should be very informative. BIX has a great many conferences and many include discussions on the packet networks themselves.  BIX is currently working on connecting themselves through Internet...but as of the time of this article, the connection is very shaky.
                                       _-Demon

LOG ON INSTRUCTIONS



Step 1: Set your computer's telecommunications program for full duplex
using 7-bit words, even parity, and 1 stop bit, or 8-bit words, no parity,
and 1 stop bit. You may call at either 300, 1200, or 2400 baud.


Step 2: To reach BIX via Tymnet

BIX is accessible from within the U.S., some of its territories and
possessions, and major Canadian cities through local Tymnet numbers. If you
don't know the Tymnet phone number(s) for your area, contact the BIX
Customer Service Line (see below). At other times, numbers can be obtained
by calling Tymnet at 800-336-0149.

  Some Tymnet callers outside the continental U.S. may be charged higher
telecommunications rates. See the `bix.business' conference for details.
Call your local Tymnet number.

  Depending on your baud rate, Tymnet will respond with "garble" or request
a terminal identifier. Enter the letter A.

  Tymnet will ask you to log in. Enter BIX and a carriage return (CR). You
will then be at the door to the BIX computer.

  If after you enter the letter A, your terminal is still unreadable, you
must change your settings from 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity to 7 bits, 1
stop bit, even parity, or vice versa.


Step 3:

    You should see the BIX welcome screen and a prompt asking you to
enter your name. Respond with the BIX user name that you selected during
registration. When prompted, enter your password.
  If you are registering, respond to the name prompt with the word new.



Accessing BIX from Outside the U.S.
To reach BIX from outside the U.S., you need a packet network account with
your local Postal Telephone & Telegraph (PTT) company. From your PTT, enter
310690157800. Then follow instructions starting at Step 3. A list of PTT
addresses and contacts for most countries is available by calling or
writing BIX. (See "Problems," on page 206 for the address and telephone
number of BIX.)



Direct Dialing
BIX has a direct-dial number in suburban Boston. The number is 617
861-9767. Enter the word BIX at the prompt. Then follow the instructions
starting at Step 3.



Problems
If you follow these instructions but still are unable to log on to BIX,
callers from the U.S. and Canada can telephone the BIX Customer Service
Line for assistance at 1800-227-2983 between 8:30 a.m. until 11 p.m.
eastern standard time (New York City time) weekdays. In New Hampshire and
outside the U.S. or Canada, call 603-924-7681.
  The mail address is BIX, One Phoenix Mill Lane, Peterborough, NH 03458.



X.25 Parameters and Overseas Users
BIX supports the X.25 communications protocol according to the latest CCITT
specification. Overseas users should be aware of the parameters BIX has set
and adjust their PAD accordingly. To see your PAD settings as BIX
understands them, from the main system prompt ( : ) enter:

  opt pad q

This will produce a numbered list. For example:

  1.1
  2.1
  3.126

and so on.  The number on the left is the parameter; the number on the
right is its value.
  Here are the parameters that BIX sets, their values, and an explanation:

Parameter    Value     Explanation

      1        16      DLE escape to PAD

                          1   134.5  baud
                          2   300    baud
                          3  1200    baud
                          4   600    baud
                          5    75    baud
                          6   150    baud
                         12  2400    baud
                         13  4800    baud
                         14  9600    baud
     12         1       XON XOFF of PAD
     13         4       PAD transmits LF to user port after echoing a CR
     14         0       No PAD after LF
     15         1       Line editing available
     16         8       Character Delete (127 decimal=del)
     17        21       Line Delete      (21 decimal = ^U)
     18         0       Line Display     (0 decimal = nul)


When you order BIX to transfer a file to you, the following adjustments are
made:

Parameter    Value     Explanation

      1         0      No DLE escape to Pad
      3         0      No data forwarding characters
      4         1      Forward on timeout (1/20 of a second)
      5         0      No flow control between PAD and user's device
      7         0      No BREAK operation
      9         0      No PAD after CR
     10         0      No line folding
     12         0      No XON XOFF of PAD
     13         0      No LF insertion
     14         0      No PAD after LF
     15         0      No line editing


When the file transfer is completed, the parameters are returned to their
original settings.

Glossary
of BIX Commands


                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
A
ADD
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Add/action:     add
When you have written a conference message, typing "add" at the add/action:
prompt will post the message. If you wish to edit your message instead,
type "edit" instead of "add." To discard your message, type "clear." You
may leave the message in the scratchpad, without discarding or posting it,
with the "quit" command.
  "List" is another option at the add/action: prompt. Before you add or
edit your message, you can read it over using "list."
  You can get help at the add/action: prompt by typing "?" or "help."
  This command's abbreviation is ADD.


AGAIN
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           again
 Read/action:    again
In a conference, the command "again" at the Read: prompt will redisplay the
message you have just read.  In mail, if you have just read a message and
want to review it, type "again" at the read/action: prompt to redisplay
that message.
  This command's abbreviation is AGA.



ALL
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           all
Typing "all" at the Read: prompt displays all unread messages in the topic
in chronological order. When you finish reading all messages in the topic,
you will be "joined" to the next topic automatically.
 If you decide to abort the "all" listing, use <CONTROL-C> or your
software's Break key.
 A good alternative to the "all" command is to specify a block of messages
(e.g., Read: 5 to 20).
 This command's abbreviation is ALL.


ATTACH
 PROMPT           COMMAND
 Send/action:     attach
The "attach" command lets you append a binary file, such as a Quattro
spreadsheet, to a mail message. To do so, write your message and exit the
writing mode. At the send/action: prompt, enter "attach" followed by the
name of the file that you want to send. For example: attach filename.com
  BIX then prepares to receive your file using the upload protocol
specified in your profile (see Chapter 8). The default protocol setting is
XMODEM. When the upload is completed, the send/action: prompt is
redisplayed. Enter "send" to mail your message with the file attched to
your correspondent.
  You can not attach more than one file to a message. To send more than one
binary file to the same recipient, upload and mail each file separately. If
you "list" your message before sending the file, you will not see your
binary attachment. Make sure that your correspondent's equipment can accom-
modate a file as large as you are sending.
  This command's abbreviation is ATT.


B
BACKWARD
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           backward # to #
BIX offers three ways to read messages in a conference: forward, backward,
and by reference. The "forward" mode displays messages in chronological
order, that is as they were entered. The "backward" mode displays messages
in reverse chronological order. "Reference" mode links original messages
with comments to those messages.
 To read only the last few messages in a conference, you can type "skip to
last, backward" at the Read: prompt. You will begin reading at the last
message. Each time you hit<RETURN> you will move back one message. When you
have read enough, you can turn "backward" mode off by typing "forward" at
the Read: prompt. All messages in the topic will be marked as read, since
you skipped to last (which marks everything as read).
  When you are reading backwards, your prompt changes to Read Bckwd:.
 This command's abbreviation is BAC.



BLINK
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Opt:            blink y
 Opt:            blink n

The "blink" option optimizes packets for overseas BIXen logging in via an
X.25 packet network. When "blink" is set to yes, it tells the "show
scratchpad" command (see below) to send full packets whenever possible.
 To turn it on, type: blink y
 To turn it off, type: blink n
 To make these features permanent, edit your profile to include the "blink"
option. See Chapter 8, "Personal BIX," for details on editing your profile.
  This command's abbreviation is BLI.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
BYE
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Main (:)        bye
 Read:           bye
 Mail:           bye

When you finish your session with BIX, log off using the command "bye."
This ensures that BIX remembers which messages you have read and which you
have not. "Bye" logs you off immediately, without asking for confirmation.
 To prevent accidents, "b" by itself generates a query: "bye? (y/n)."
 If you type "by" BIX accepts it as "bye."
 BIX displays your total connect time as you log off.
 This command's abbreviation is BYE.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

C

C
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Command->     c
Within the verbose editor, you may clear your scratchpad (that is, erase
the message) by typing "c" at the Command-> prompt.

 PROMPT        COMMAND
 E:            $,C
Within the Quiet editor, you can change a line using C. It must be preceded
by a line number or a range of line numbers. For example, 1c, 1,5c, 8,$c


CLEAR
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Add/action:     clear
 Send/action:    clear
 Main ( : )      clear
 Read:           clear
 Mail:           clear
If you have typed a message to add to a conference, but change your mind
and wish to discard it, type "clear" at the add/action: prompt. The message
will be purged from your scratchpad and will not be posted in the confer-
ence.
  "Clear" will discard any mail message you have written when it is entered
from the send/action: prompt.
  From the main ( : ), Read:, or Mail: prompts, "clear" will empty the con-
tents of your scratchpad.
 This command's abbreviation is CLE.



COMMENT
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Read:         comment
The "comment" command allows you to enter a message in a conference in
response to another message. Your comment will be "chained" to the message
you have read most recently and will have a header that says "This is a
comment to message #."
 If you want to make a comment to a message other than the one you have
just read, and if you know its number, the fastest way to do that is to
type "com" followed by the message number.  See also "say" and "reference."
 This command's abbreviation is COM.



COOKIE
The "cookie" command will display an epigram, homily, or pithy saying. It
can be added to your profile. See Chapter 8.



CURRENT
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           current to #
"Current" eliminates the need for you to remember where you last were in a
topic. Typing "current" at the Read: prompt allows you to read the first
unread message in the topic. For example, header current to last
will display the headers for all the unread messages in the topic beginning
where you left off until the end. See also "header."
 This command's abbreviation is CUR.



D

D
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Command->       d line #, line #
 E:              line #, line # d
Within the Verbose editor, you may delete a line by typing "d" followed by
the line number at the Command-> prompt. For example, to delete line 10,
enter d10.
  To delete several lines, type "d" followed by the line numbers separated
by a comma.  For example, if you wish to delete lines 5 through 8 in your
text, type d5,8.
 In the Quiet editor, the syntax is reversed. For example, you could delete
line 5 by typing "5d" from the E: prompt. To delete a range of lines, type
a range of numbers separated by a comma with "d" attached. For example, to
delete lines 7 through 10 from your text, type 7,10d.



DATE
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           date 24jun88 [to date 27jun88]
 Read:           skip to date 24jun88
The "date" command allows you to jump directly to messages in a conference
that were entered on a particular day. Valid formats include:

  date 23jun88
  date 1988feb27
  date 88Dec2

Note that the word "date" must always be included in the command.
  When you use the "skip to date" command, all messages before the first
message found are marked as unread. This is consistent with the "skip"
command.
 This command's abbreviation is DAT.



DELETE
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read/action:    delete
 Mail:           delete message #

In Mail, when you have read a message and wish to discard it, use the
"delete" command at the read/action: prompt. The message will disappear
from your inbasket and from the sender's outbasket.
  If you have read a message and left it in your inbasket, you may delete
it at a later time by typing "delete" followed by the message number at the
Mail: prompt. You will see an identification line to assure that this is
the message you want to delete. If you confirm that it is, the message will
disappear from your inbasket.
  You can delete a range of messages from your inbasket. For example,

  del 1-4,5,8,11-15

This will delete messages 1 through 4, messages 5 and 8, and messages 11
through 15. Note that there are no spaces between items to delete.
 You may delete messages from your outbasket using "delete" followed by the
message number. You will not be asked to confirm this action.
  Note: Deleting messages from your outbasket does not delete the message
from the recipient's inbasket.
 This command's abbreviation is DEL.



DOWNLOAD
 PROMPT         COMMAND
 Main (:),      download
 Read:          download
 Mail:          download
After you have selected a communications protocol, use this command to
receive messages that you have filed into your scratchpad. The default
setting is XMODEM with checksum.
 See Chapter 10, "Advanced BIX Techniques," for details.
 This command's abbreviation is DOW.



E
ECHO
Use the "echo" command to customize your log-on screens. "Echo [text]" -
inserted in your profile will cause BIX to display the [text] at log on.
For example, you might add echo ---Conference Messages--- to your Profile
just above the "show new" command. The next time you log on, ---Conference
Messages--- will appear as a header to your new message summary.


EDIT
If you have just typed a message and wish to edit it, type "edit" at the
add/action: or send/action: prompt and hit your Return key. Then type "h"
for a list of your options.
  From the Read:, Mail:, or main (:) prompts, the "edit" command allows you
to edit several sorts of files and to set your default editor. The "Edit"
commands available from these prompts are:


<RETURN>      If no option is listed, "scratchpad" is assumed.
 profile      Edit your log-on profile.
 resume       Edit your resume file.
 set          Set default editor, prompts for V or Q.
 set quiet    Set default editor to Quiet editor.
 set verbose  Set default editor to Verbose editor.

See also "profile," "resume," "set." See also Chapter 5, "Editing
Messages."



EXIT
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Command->       x
 E:              w<RETURN>q
Within the Verbose editor, when you have finished editing your message and
wish to return to the add/action: or send/action: prompt, type "x," which
stands for "exit." This saves your message and exits the editor.
 In the Quiet editor, save your work and exit the editor by typing "w"
followed by a carriage return and "q" (quit).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                          
F
FILE
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Main (:)        file any BIX command, such as
 Read:           show part, message #, all
 Mail:           mail message #, all
The "file" command allows you to copy messages, lists, or the result of any
command to your scratchpad, where you can edit and incorporate it into mail
or conference messages. For example, to insert the list of conference
participants into your scratchpad, you would enter from a Read: prompt in
that conference, "file show participants."
Note that there is no indication on the screen that something has been
filed. You will not see your filed text until you enter your scratchpad.
You can see it immediately by typing "show scratchpad" or "edit" then "l"
(if you use the Verbose editor). See Chapter 10, "Advanced BIX Techniques,"
for details.
 This command's abbreviation is FIL.



FILTER
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Opt:            filter no
 Opt:            filter yes
In the Option subsystem, you can specify that BIX should pass control
characters through without change ("filter no") or make control characters
printable ("filter yes").
 To make these features permanent, edit your profile  to include the
"filter" option. See Chapter 8, "Personal BIX" for details on editing your
profile.



FIRST
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           first to #
 Read:           skip to first
Typing "first" at the Read: prompt allows you to read the first message in
the topic (that is message number 1). "Skip to first" will mark all the
messages in the topic as unread, so that BIX will treat them as if you had
not seen them and will present them as new messages.
 See also "current" and "last."
 This command's abbreviation is FIR.



FORWARD

PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read ref:      forward
 Read bkwd:     forward
 Read/action:   forward
If you have been reading messages in a conference by "reference" or "back-
ward," you can return to reading messages in chronological order (the order
in which they were submitted) by typing "forward." "Forward" is the default
setting.

PROMPT          COMMAND
 Mail:          forward

In the Mail subsystem, "forward" is the command that allows you to take a
message you have received from someone else and forward it to a third party
(or parties).
 To do this, type "forward" at the read/action: prompt. You will be
prompted for names. After you have entered the names of the people to whom
you are forwarding the message, you will see the fwd/action: prompt. You
may "send" or "quit" here. (Type "?" at the fwd/action: prompt for a
complete list of commands.) You will see a "Message forwarded..." note,
then the read/action: prompt. BIX is asking what you want to do with the
original message (delete or leave) now that it has been passed on to
others.
 This command's abbreviation is FOR.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

H
HEADER
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           header # to #
A conference message's header lists the conference and topic names, message
number, author, character count, date submitted, whether the message is a
comment and whether there are any comments on the message.
 You can scan quickly through a range of messages using the "header"
command. For example, typing "header 5 to 15" at the Read: prompt will list
headers and first lines for messages 5 through 15.
  Each message whose header has been scanned is marked as having been read.
  "Header" works well with the BIX specifiers "current," "first," and
"last."
 This command's abbreviation is HEA.



HELP
There are several ways to get help:
1) Type "help command" for general help on that command.
2) At most prompts,"help," "h," or "?" produces a list of your options at
     that spot.
3) If you type any BIX command followed by a question mark, you get a list
     of valid arguments or subcommands to that command.
4) For a list of the commands for which help is available, type "help
     hfiles."
5) Call the BIX help line at (800) 227-2983 or (603) 924-7681, Monday
   through Friday from 8.30 a.m. until 11 p.m. (eastern standard time).

 Read            skip to last
 Read Bckwd:     last to #

If you type "last" at the Read: prompt, BIX jumps to the last message in
the topic. Press your Return key to go back to the first unread message.
 To scroll through a range of messages, you can type "message # to last."
 "Skip to last" takes you directly to the last message in the topic and
marks all earlier messages as read. This means that BIX assumes that you
have read these messages and will not show them to you automatically.
 See also "skip," "header," "current," and "first."
 At the Read Bckwd: prompt, "last to #" will show you new messages in
reversed order, beginning with the last message in the conference and
continuing backwards to the message number specified.
 This command's abbreviation is LAS.



LEAVE
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read/action:    leave
In Mail, after you have read a message, you can leave it there for later
action. To leave it, enter the command "leave." The message will be marked
as "read" (indicated with an R after the message number).
 To see the message at a later time, type its number at the Mail: prompt.
 To delete the message that you have read and left in your inbasket, type
"delete" followed by the message number from the Mail: prompt. You will see
a confirmation line to make sure that it is the message you want to delete.
When you confirm that it is, the message is removed from your inbasket.
 This command's abbreviation is LEA.



LIST
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Add/action:     list
 Send/action:    list
If you are adding a message to a conference, the "list" command at the
add/action: prompt prints a copy of your message on the screen so that you
can check it before you post it.
  In Mail, the command performs a similar function when entered from the
send/action: prompt.
  See also "L."
  This command's abbreviation is LIS.

"Mailcall" notifies you when a mail message arrives in your inbasket while
you are on line. It does this by transmitting a beep and a message that
says "*New mail from: ...*"
  The default setting is "Yes."  To turn off this feature, enter from the
Opt: prompt: mailcall no.
  "Mailcall verbose" produces the message "*New mail from: ...*" and

 Read:           [show] new
 Mail:           [show] new
When used in conjunction with the "show" command, "new" will list all your
conferences that have unread messages. This is the list you see when you
log on.



NEWLINE
 PROMPT           COMMAND
 Main (:)         newline
If your text is writing over your lines and you have been unable to adjust
your communications software, enter this command from the main system
prompt. It should take care of your problem.
  Add it to your profile to make it a permanent feature. See Chapter 8,
"Personal BIX," for details.



NEWS
The "news" command in your profile displays the bulletin message, if any,
when you log on.
 See also "profile."



NEXT
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           next
The command "next" moves you from one topic into the nearest topic on your
conference list that contains an unread message.
  See also "topic."



NONEWLINE
 PROMPT           COMMAND
 Main (:)         nonewline
If you receive double line spaces whenever you press Return and you have
been unable to adjust your communications software, enter this command from
the main system prompt. It should take care of your problem.
  Add it to your profile to make it a permanent feature. See Chapter 8,
"Personal BIX," for details.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                          
O
ORDER
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Main (:)        order conference1 conference2
 Read:           join order conference1 conference2
Each time you log on, BIX automatically shows your conferences in the order
in which you joined them. The "order" command allows you to rearrange this
list.
  Type "order conference1 conference2" to place conference1 before
conference2.
You may use "first" or "last" as an argument. For example, "order confer-
ence1 first" will place conference1 first on your list.
 Placing a conference last on your list, however, is a little more complex.
"Order last conference" will simply put whatever is last above
"conference." "Order conference last" will put "conference" just above the
last entry on the list. So, to put a conference last on your list, you must
use the two in conjunction: "order conference last; order last conference."
 This command's abbreviation is ORD.



ORIGINAL
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Read:         original
 Read/action: original
While reading messages in a conference, you will often see the statement
"Comment to #" in a message header. To see the message commented on, type
"original."
 In Mail, if the message you're reading is a reply, "original" will show
you the message that inspired the reply.
 This command's abbreviation is ORI.



OUTBASKET
 PROMPT           COMMAND
 Mail:            outbasket
This command displays all the mail messages you have sent, both read and
unread. If a recipient has read and deleted your message, it disappears
from your outbasket.
  This command's abbreviation is OUTB.
                                                                                                                                               



P
PARTICIPANTS
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Main (:)      show participants
 Main (:)      show participants conference name
 Read:         show participants
 Read:         show participant [conference] [user name]
For a list of the members of a conference, type "show participants" fol-
lowed by the name of the conference. Note that you must be a member of the
conference to see this list.
  To see the participants from within a conference (that is, at the Read:
prompt), type "show participants."
  For a list of all BIX users type "show participants" at the main system
prompt (:), but be prepared for a long list. You can type "quit" at the
.More.. prompt to abort the list.
  To see if someone is a member of a particular conference, from a Read:
prompt type "show participant" followed by the conference name and the
person's BIXname.
 This command's abbreviation is PAR.



PASSWORD
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Main (:)      password
 Read:         password
The "password" command allows you to change your password. BIX will ask for
your old password. BIX will then prompt you for the new password, and you
will be asked to enter it a second time for verification purposes.
 When you are prompted for a password, you must type something, or BIX will
simply discard your password. If you decide against changing your password,
simply type your old one again.
 It is a good idea to change passwords regularly, to prevent any
unauthorized use of your BIX account. A password must have at minimum four
characters and no more than eight characters.
  BIX passwords must be used exactly as you entered them, observing case
and special characters. See Chapter 10 for more details.



PROFILE
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Main (:)        edit profile
 Main (:)        show profile
Your profile tells BIX what options you wish to use. To change your op-
tions, enter "edit profile" from the main system prompt. See Chapter 8,
"Personal BIX," for more details.
  To see your current profile settings, enter "show profile" from the main
system prompt.


PROMPTS
Each area of BIX has its own prompt so that you can identify where you are.
These are the prompts you will see:

 Prompt         Explanation

 :              Main level prompt
 Read:          Conferencing subsystem prompt
 Read Bkwd:     Read messages backward
 Read Ref:      Read messages by reference
 Add/action:    Add, clear, or edit a conference message
 Mail:          Mail subsystem prompt
 Send/action:   Send, clear, or edit a mail message
 Read/action:   Delete or leave mail message received
 Opt:           Option subsystem prompt
 Command ->     Verbose editor prompt
 E:             Quiet editor prompt

If you have the "terse" mode set, you will see shorter versions of some
prompts. Read: becomes R:; Read Ref: becomes Rf:; add/action: is simply A:
and Mail: is M:.
  The Listing area has a distinctive command line. You can identify the
area you are in by referring to the upper left-hand corner of the command
line.




Q
QUIT
The "quit" command usually gets you out of whatever you are doing. For
example, if you are reading a long message, "q" at the .More.. prompt will
let you bypass the rest of the message.
  "Q" does not work when you use the "all" command. Use Control-C in this
situation.
  Type "q" to leave the Mail and Option subsystems and return to the main
( : ) prompt.
  In a conference, "q" at the Read: prompt will get you out of a topic and
return you to the main system prompt ( : ).
  If you are adding a message to a conference, "q" at the add/action:
prompt will return you to the Read: prompt without posting the message. The
message remains in your scratchpad. This works the same way at the
send/action: prompt in Mail.
  In Verbose and Quiet editors, "q" will "undo" your latest editing
session.
  The editors work on a copy of what is in your scratchpad. When you "quit"
the copy is discarded and you leave the editor.  Any previously filed and
saved data is left unaltered. To save your editing session and leave the
editor, use "x" in the Verbose editor, and "w <RETURN> q" in the Quiet
editor.
 To LOG OFF FROM BIX, the command is "bye." "Bye" works from the main (:),
Read: and Mail: prompts. BIX will log you off immediately, without request-
ing a confirmation.
 This command's abbreviation is Q.




R

READ
"Read" is one of BIX's most important functions. You will rarely have to
type "read" because it is automatically invoked with a carriage return
whenever there is a conference message to read.
 BIX offers you many ways to "read" through a conference. These include
reading by "reference," "backward" or "forward," and reading a particular
message (by number) or a range of numbers. You may also "skip" messages.
 From the Read: prompt you can add your comments to a conference. For a
complete list of Read: options, type "read ?" at the main prompt (:) or
"help" at the Read: prompt.



RECENT
 PROMPT      COMMAND
 Opt:        recent maximum
 Opt:        recent minimum
 Opt:        recent days
The "recent" command sets the default number of unread messages that BIX
shows you when you join a conference for the first time. There are three
separate parameters: "maximum," "minimum," and "days."  The default
settings are: maximum, 50; minimum, 25; and days, 30.
  When you first join a topic, BIX uses "recent" to set your pointers to
show you only those messages that are newer than the current date minus the
"days" setting. If that results in more than "maximum" setting, your
pointers are set so that there are only the "maximum" number of unread
messages.
 To start a conference with fewer messages or nearer to the present date,
adjust the "maximum" parameter to a smaller number. For example, "recent
maximum 25" or "recent days 10."
 To start a new conference with more messages, set "maximum" to a larger
number. For example, "recent maximum 150" or "recent days 40."
  If there are fewer messages than the "minimum," your pointers are set so
that there are the "minimum" number of unread messages regardless of the
"days" setting.
NOTE: The "recent" option limits the number of messages displayed only when
you initially join a conference. This option does not limit the number of
messages displayed when you enter a conference you are already joined to.
All messages that do not fall within the "recent" range are still available
to you. See the commands "backward" and "skip" to see how you can access
older messages.



REFERENCE
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           reference
The "reference" command helps you follow the thread of a discussion in a
conference. Instead of seeing messages in the order in which they were
entered, you see a message and the comments it has generated.
 Once invoked, reference mode will stay in force until you enter the
command "forward" or "backward" or until you log off BIX.
 This command's abbreviation is REF.



REPLY
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read/action:    reply
If you read a mail message and wish to respond immediately, type "reply" at
the read/action: prompt. You will enter your scratchpad, where you can type
your reply.
 When you end your note, you will encounter these three prompts one after
another:

  1) Attach original message?     Default is No;
  2) Send/action:                 Edit or send this reply;
  3) Read/action:                 BIX is asking what you want to do with
                                    the message you just read.

  If you want to respond to a message that you have previously read, and if
you know its number, the fastest way to do this is to type "rep message #."
This command's abbreviation is REP.



RESIGN CONFERENCE
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Main (:)        resign conference name
 Read:           resign conference name
You can resign from a conference at any time. To resign from the Macintosh
conference, you would enter "resign macintosh" from the main prompt ( : )
or from a Read: prompt. BIX will ask for a confirmation. Answer "y" for
yes; "n" for no.
 Once resigned from a conference, BIX will no longer notify you of any new
messages in that conference.
  If you rejoin the conference later, BIX assumes you have read none of the
messages in the conference.
  This command's abbreviation is RES.


RESIGN TOPIC
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Main (:)        resign conference topic name
 Read:           resign conference topic name
To resign from a topic without resigning from the whole conference, use the
"resign" command followed by both the conference name and the topic name.
For example to resign from the topic `babbage' in the conference `history,'
type: resign history babbage.
  This command's abbreviation is RES TOP.



RESUME
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Main (:)        edit resume or show resume [BIXname]
 Read:           edit resume or show resume [BIXname]
 Mail:           edit resume or show resume [BIXname]
The command "resume" must be used in conjunction with another BIX command.
The name and address that you typed into BIX when you first signed on are
listed in your resume. Your phone number is not listed. To edit your
resume, enter "edit resume" from the main ( : ) system prompt.
  To see a resume, type "show resume" followed by a BIXname at the main
( : ), Mail:, Read:, read/action: or send/action: prompt.
  This command's abbreviation is RES.



ROOT
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           root
The command "root" will display the message that instigated a thread of
messages. Where "original" will display the message that has been commented
on, "root" will display the message that began a thread. Enter "reference"
at the Read: prompt immediately after reading the root message to follow a
thread from its beginning.
 See also "original."
 The command's abbreviation is ROO.


S
SAY
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           say
To add a message to a conference, type "say" at the Read: prompt. You will
enter your scratchpad, where you can compose your note.
  Messages added to a conference using "say" are not identified as com-
ments. If you want your message to be associated with one already posted,
use the command "comment" instead of "say."
 This command's abbreviation is SAY.



SCRATCHPAD
Your scratchpad is like a pad of paper upon which you can write notes for
any purpose. You can reach your scratchpad from the Read: prompt by using
the command "comment" or "say." From Mail, you enter into your scratchpad
using the commands  "to" or "reply." From the main ( : ) prompt, you can
enter "edit scratchpad."
  When you use the "file" command, the text that was specified goes to your
scratchpad. To reach it, enter the scratchpad as described above or by
entering "show scratchpad" from the main ( : ), Read:, or Mail: prompt.
  The abbreviation for "scratchpad" is SCR.



SEARCH

PROMPT          COMMAND
 Read:           search `string'
The "search" command allows you to search for any occurrence of a series of
letters within a conference topic. "Search" `string' will display a list
including the message number and the line of text in which the string
occurs for each instance.
 The syntax for the search command is search [low] to [high] string. The
item sought must be defined through single quote marks. For example,

  search 15 to 100 `modem'

will search for the word "modem" in messages 15 through 100.
  A search can use any of the normal BIX message specifiers, like "date" or
"first" or simply a message number. For example,

  search date 30apr88 to date 4july88 `modem'

will search every message entered between April 30, 1988, and July 4, 1988,
for the word modem.
  NOTE: Case is not distinguished.
  This command's abbreviation is SEA.



SET
 PROMPT            COMMAND
 Main: (:)        edit set
 Read:            edit set
 Mail:            edit set
You may choose the editor you prefer using the "edit set" command. The de-
fault editor is the Verbose editor. The alternative is the Quiet editor, an
adaptation of the Unix editor "ed."



SHOW
The "show" command gives you access to many kinds of information. You can
call up lists of groups, conferences, or participants; you can see the
contents of your scratchpad, your resume, or someone else's resume; and you
can find someone's BIXname using "show." Show options are:

<no option>       List the conferences you have joined.
 ALL              List all BIX conferences.
 ALL `string'     List all conference titles with  `string'.
 Conference name  List conference details.
 GROups           Display list of conference groups.
 GROup group name List conferences in a group.
 NEW              List conferences with new messages.
 PARticipants     List members of the conference you are reading
                    when entered from a Read: prompt.
 PARticipants     List all BIX participants if entered from the main
                    prompt ( : ).
 PARticipants
 conference       List participants in specified conference. You must
                    be a member of the conference to get this list.
 PARticipant
[conference] [user name]  See if user name is a conference member.
 OPT Q            Display Options settings.
 RESume BIXname   Show resume of a BIX participant.
 SCRatchpad       Display contents of scratchpad.
 STAtus           List of conference members; last log-on for each.
                    Entered from a  Read: prompt.
STAtus conference  List of members of specified conference and latest
                     log-on for  each.
 WELcome           Display welcome message for current  conference.
 WHO name          Find BIXname for name. Use any part of the person's
                     name, BIXname, or geographic location that you happen
                     to know.

 This command's abbreviation is SHO.



SKIP
 PROMPT      COMMAND
 Read:       skip #
 Read:       skip to #, first, or last
 Read:       skip back #
The "skip" command allows you to bypass messages in a topic. BIX will
assume that you have read any messages you skip, and will not show them to
you again, unless you ask for them explicitly or skip back to them.
  For example, if you type "skip 10" at the Read: prompt you will skip over
10 messages. "Skip to last" puts you at the end of the topic. "Skip to
first" puts you back at the beginning of the topic and "unmarks" all
messages in the topic. (That is, BIX will now show them to you as if you
had never seen them.)
 If you want to reread messages you have already seen or skipped, you can
"skip back" any number of messages. If you want to reread the message you
have just read, use "skip back 0" or "again." "Skip back 0" has the effect
of resetting your message pointer back one message.
  Skip can also be used with the "date" command. For example, "skip to date
23aug88" will mark all messages written before August 23, 1988 as read.
 This command's abbreviation is SKI.



STATUS
 PROMPT            COMMAND
 Main (:)          status
 Mail:             status
 Read:             show status
At the main (:) prompt, "status" displays the number of messages in your
inbasket, the number of conferences of which you are a member, your total
connect time for the present session, and the number of bytes in your
scratchpad.
 In the Mail subsystem, the "status" command will show you your
correspondence lists (From and To).
 Within a conference, typing "show status" at the Read: prompt will display
a list of all conference participants, showing when each person last logged
onto BIX.
 This command's abbreviation is STA.



SUBSTITUTE
 PROMPT            COMMAND
 Command->         s line #
 E:                line # s/old text/new text/
Within the Verbose editor, you may substitute one string for another using
the command "s" followed by the line number. The editor will prompt for the
old and new text, in the format: "/oldtext/newtext/." The backslashes are
delimiters.
 In the Quiet editor, the format is line number followed by "s" and then
the old and new strings delimited by slashes. If you do not specify a line
number, the current line is the default.




T
TERM ANSI
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Opt:          term ansi
"Term ansi" sets your terminal type to ANSI emulation. This is used for the
McGraw-Hill News Service and to determine how to clear your screen in the
Listings menu mode. It serves no other function at this time.
  CBix supports ANSI terminal emulation. The /terminal command in CBix is
used to set this. See Chapter 9 for details.



TERM TTY
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Opt:          term TTY
"Term tty" sets your terminal type to TTY emulation (that is, no emula-
tion). This is used for the McGraw-Hill News Service and to determine how
to clear your screen in the Listings menu mode. It serves no other function

TERM VT52
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Opt:          term VT52
"Term vt52" sets your terminal type to VT52 emulation. This is used for the
McGraw-Hill News Service and to determine how to clear your screen in the
Listings menu mode. It serves no other function at this time.

TERMINAL
 PROMPT            COMMAND
 Opt:              terminal page length
 Opt:              terminal width #
You can let BIX know how long and how wide your screen is using the
"terminal" commands in the Option subsystem. To set page length, type
"terminal pagelength" followed by a number and then "q." BIX will send the
specified number of lines per screen, then a .More.. prompt.
  To suppress the .More.. prompt, set the page length to zero (0).
 Set the number of characters BIX sends per line with "terminal width"
followed by a number and "q" (for quit). BIX will send the specified number
before breaking the line.
 To make the terminal specifications a permanent part of your BIX
environment, change the commands in your profile. See Chapter 8, for
complete instructions.



TERSE
 PROMPT            COMMAND
 Main (:)          terse
 Opt:              terse
In "terse" mode you see a shortened version of all prompts and message
headers. There are two ways to set "terse" mode. If you type "terse" at the
main system prompt, you will have shortened prompts and headers until you
log off. The next time you sign in you will have the full, or "verbose,"
prompts and headers.
 You can set "terse" as your permanent default mode by changing the line in
your profile that reads "opt verbose" to "opt terse." See Chapter 8, "Per-
sonal BIX," for instructions on editing your profile.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  


TIME
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Main ( : )      time


"Time" displays the time of day based on eastern standard time (U.S.). It
can be appended to your profile so that it appears whenever you sign in.
See Chapter 8, "Personal BIX," for details.

TOPIC
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Main ( : )      conference topic
 Read:           topic
Conference messages are divided into topics; each topic has its own set of
message numbers. When you have read the last message in a topic, you will
see the message "No more unread." BIX will then automatically join you to
the next topic on your conference list that has unread messages.
  You can jump from one topic to another using the command "topic" entered
from a Read: prompt. To do this, enter "topic" followed by the topic name.
If you do not know the topic name, BIX will display a list of applicable
topics for that conference. Respond to the prompt with the name of the
topic you want.
  At the Topic? prompt, entering a "q" or "quit" will let you exit from the
prompt without selecting a topic.
  To resign a topic while maintaining your membership within a conference,
type in the command "resign" followed by the conference name and topic
name. For example, "resign music vivaldi" will resign you from the topic
`vivaldi' in the `music' conference while retaining your membership in all
other topics.



U
UPLOAD
 PROMPT         COMMAND
 Main (:)       upload
 Read:          upload
 Mail:          upload
Use "upload" to send files up to BIX. Uploaded files are deposited into
your scratchpad from where you can mail or post them. The default upload
protocol is XMODEM with checksum.
  See Chapter 10, "Advanced BIX Techniques," for details.
 This command's abbreviation is UPL.



UNREAD
 PROMPT         COMMAND
 Mail:          unread

This command displays the unread messages in your Mail inbasket.
  This command's abbreviation is UNR.


V
VERBOSE
 PROMPT         COMMAND
 Main ( : )     verbose
 Opt:           verbose
 Opt:           verbose
Verbose is used two ways in BIX: with prompts and with editors.
 You can see prompts and message headers in two forms: in "Verbose" mode
you see the long form; in "Terse" mode you see the short form. Verbose is
the default.
  To change temporarily from "Verbose" to "Terse" mode, type "terse" at the
main (:) prompt. To change modes permanently, edit your profile. See Chap-
ter 8, "Personal BIX," for instructions on editing your profile.
 BIX offers a choice of text editors: the Verbose editor and the Quiet
editor. The default editor is the Verbose. You can change editors from the
Option subsystem. See Chapter 5, "Editing Messages," for more on the
editors.




W
W
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Command->     w
 E:            w
Within the Verbose and Quiet editors you can save your work without leaving
the editor using the "w" command.
   "W" stands for write.



WELCOME
Most BIX conferences have a welcome message that you will see when you
first join a conference. If you would like to see the message again later,
type "show welcome" from a Read: prompt.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
WHO
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Main (:),
 Read:, Mail:  who
 Main (:),
 Read:, Mail:  show who name
 Main ( :),
 Read:, Mail:   who conference
 Main ( :),
 Read:, Mail:   who all
 Main ( : ),
 Read:, Mail:   who list
The command "who" will show you the names of people logged onto BIX at the
same time as you.
 From the main (:), Read: or Mail: prompts "show who" followed by a name
will list the real name and BIX nickname for anyone with that name or
BIXname. This is useful when you need to find someone's BIX nickname in
order to send mail. Type "show who" and whatever part of the person's BIX
name or real name you happen to know.
 The "show who" command string will also pick up references to city, state
and country. So, for example, if you would like to know who is on BIX from
San Francisco, type "show who francisco."
  The command string "who conference" will tell you if anyone is in that
conference's CBix area.
  The command string "who all" will tell you if anyone is in a CBix area
anywhere on BIX.
  The command string "who list" will display any CBix users in only those
conferences in your conference list.



WITHDRAW
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Read:         withdraw
Use the "withdraw" command to retract a message you have posted. Position
yourself in the conference topic where you posted the message to be with-
drawn. Enter "withdraw" followed by the message number.
 If entered immediately after you have posted a message, it will withdraw
the current message.
  This command is abbreviated WIT.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                            
WITHDRAW
 PROMPT        COMMAND
 Mail:         withdraw
 You can withdraw a mail message you sent to someone else only if that
person has not yet read the message. To do this, enter "withdraw" followed
by the message number.  You can use either the relative or absolute
outbasket number.
  BIX tells you when a message has been successfully withdrawn and removes
the message line from your outbasket and from the recipient's inbasket.
  If the message has already been read, BIX informs you that it cannot
remove the message and leaves the message line in your outbasket.
  Messages sent to multiple recipients are handled on a case-by-case basis.
If one person has read the message and two have not, the message is removed
from the inbaskets of the two who have not read it, but not from the one
who has. In this case, the message line will be left in your outbasket.
  This command's abbreviation is WIT.




X
X
 PROMPT          COMMAND
 Command->       x
Within the Verbose editor, when you have finished editing your message and
wish to return to the add/action: or send/action: prompt, type "x," which
stands for "exit." This saves your message and exits the editor.
