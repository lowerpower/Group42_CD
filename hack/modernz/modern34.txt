    Internally Switched Interface System (ISIS) Recovery Module. The       
    software component of the Automatic Port Switching System (APSS)       
    residing in an ISIS slot, that automatically switches user access to   
    the backup Engine when a fault is detected in the Engine. Provides the 
    user interface and control of the Port Switch Module (PSM). See        
    heartbeat.

    ============

    Transmission that combines certain characteristics of synchronous and  
    asynchronous transmission. It uses start and stop bits as does         
    asynchronous communication, but it also uses a common time base or     
    clock, as does synchronous communication.

    ===

    Intermediate Text Block. In Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC),   
    a control character used to terminate an intermediate block of         
    characters. The block-check character is sent immediately following    
    ITB, and line-turnaround does not occur. The response following End of 
    Transmission Block (ETB) or End of Text (ETX) also applies to all of   
    the ITB checks immediately preceding the clock terminated by ETB       
    or ETX.
