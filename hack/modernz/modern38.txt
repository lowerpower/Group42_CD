    Multiple Extended Processor (MP)                                           
    ================================

    A system that moves the Dispatcher capabilities from the Engine ISIS   
    Kernel to the Extended Processor Interface (XPI) board, a Direct Memory
    Access (DMA) device.

    =========

    To subdivide a transmission channel into two or more separate channels 
    of slower speeds. A means of interleaving or concurrently transmitting 
    more than one message on a single channel.                             




    multiplexed packet switching                                               
    ============================

    A network in which each node assembles/disassembles a packet containing
    data from different users. Data within the packet can have a different 
    source and destination than other data in the packet. The one          
    commonality is that the virtual circuits (logical pathways from source 
    to destination) all include the same internode link. TYMNET is a       
    multiplexed packet-switching network.                                  




    Multiplexed Permanent Virtual Circuit (MPVC)                               
    ============================================

    A virtual circuit that permits a group of users and multiple sessions  
    access to a circuit.

    ==========

    A configuration in which one front-end processor (FEP) communicates to 
    several cluster controllers over a connection to one of the cluster    
    controllers. The cluster controller configuration is similiar to a     
    daisy chain. Also called multidrop.

    ==============

    A list of destination targets (requested by users simultaneously) from 
    which the Supervisor selects one to complete the circuit request.      




    Mutual Conversion Program (MCP)                                            
    ===============================

    A program that translates one character set to another.  Specifically, 
    a BT North America product that translates the standard set of Katakana
    characters.

    ===

    Circuit Multiplexer. An ISIS slot program that allows users to build   
    and maintain multiple circuits to other tools and applications on their
    hosts. A MUX also allows its users to communicate with other users with
    a Talk mode facility. The MUX is accessed over a Boss circuit as a host
    in an ISIS slot.
