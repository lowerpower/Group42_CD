	How's bout this boys. The CIA controlls every computer. Every one.
Just think, the first vacuum tube, first transistor, first information
transmitted over a wire, first microchip was invented in this country.
It could have been a plan from the very beginning. Get the world hooked
on computers, make them so incredibly useful that they cant do without.
But all the time knowing that we have total control over all information
flowing through a wire in the world. 
	Thats probably why the government gave AT&T a monopoly on long
distance for so long. The first big computer networks were set up by
AT&T, which was, all the while, very friendly with government agencies.
I dont want to hear about the economies of scale shit. Long distance can
be provided more economically by competing companies. The CIA is
listening to _every_ conversation traveling more than 20 miles.^*
	The CIA probably has a backdoor written into every operating
system, bbs program, piece of security software around. It makes so much
sense. The WWII parent orginization of the CIA was the first to use
computers. They knew the deal. They are smarter than you think, or will
ever know. Its the easiest way. Getting into something is hard, unless
you put something on the inside to let you in. The backdoors are written
into the very complex, transistor microcode in such an insidious way,
even the brightest hackers can't find or protect themselves against such
a subtle threat. 
	Everything has been invented already. They just havent released
it into the market yet. They know how to move individual atoms, and know
about even smaller things. They can make anything. It just isn't
economically feasible to release it for sale. They're too busy making
money off the stuff that is here already. If they put a man on the moon,
I'm sure they can make machines that can tell exactly how fast your car
is going. (But even the scientists aren't stupid enough to release that
kind of information. They speed too.)   
	You don't realise it, but they control everything about you,
what you eat (or tell you what isn't disgusting, you'll eat everything
else), what you wear (or tell you what is out of fashion), and what you
think (the cosby show will be funny this season, but next year they
won't because too many blacks are starting to listen to Al Sharpton).
Sorry to drop this shit on you, but there is no such thing as free will.
You have the free will to decide on tuna with provolone or turkey with 
tomato for lunch, but not what you feel, desire and believe. 
	They know what color your underwear is, not because they have x
ray specs, but because they told you to wear the blue and white striped
boxers today. Maybe tomorrow you'll show them and wear the bikini briefs
you haven't worn since grammar school, but they know that. They're just
punishing you for trying to trick them. That pair of underwear would make
a big man weep. The CIA knows how restricting those undies can be after
going through puberty. Your just falling into their trap. They are
laughing at you. Go ahead, wear no underwear tomorrow, you'll probably
have a chance to get laid and have it ruined because the girl thinks its
disgusting you wear no underwear, or get it stuck in your zipper because
John Thomas is free to roam all over the place. Just go with it, and
wear the plaid ones tomorrow. Selling out isn't so bad, if you have
something to look forward to...death.
	But even that's overrated. Sorry, man but there aint no heaven,
no hell, no really groovy jazz bar you go to when you die. You just
kinda feed the worms. Any maybe the worm you feed is used on a hook to
catch a fish, which feeds a king. Sorry for the Hamlet allusion, but
good old Billy Shakespeare knew what's up. God, (to be taken as an
exsparated interjection, not as a reference to an actual supreme
being) he had enough death in his plays, especially the grusome
hopeless variety. You're just part of the chain, the whole scheme of
things. But maybe there is a supreme being that started the entire chain
of events, the "Almighty Cause". If he's so almighty, why don't I have a
decent pair of speakers? Go figure. Or maybe He is the wrathful God of
the Jews and wont give me my speakers, because I don't deserve them. I
have to work for them. If he is the God of the Jews, why can't he at
least get it for me from his nephew in the stereo business for cost? Go
figure. Doesn't make any sense to me. If they are the "Chosen People"
what are they chosen for? To die horrible greusome deaths at the hands
of some foreign power? The only people I can think of as chosen, are the
people in tribes in uncharted regions of africa, spaced as far away as
possible from every TV, McDonalds, plastic bag, crack vial, and girl from
Jersey City with big hair.







* A study was done and it was found that most conversations between two
points less than 20 miles of each other, consists of 80% grocery lists,
10% complaing, 5% of what one is going to do tonight, and 5% prank
calls, which may be illegal, but most are CIA originated, or at least
approved.
