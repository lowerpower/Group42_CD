    (external) circuit path information (origination/destination node,     
    host, and port numbers, and codes indicating the circuit type and      
    speed). Each node builds its part of the circuit based on the          
    information in the Needle as it threads its way through the network    
    carrying the data.                                                     
    There are two types of Needles: TYM2 (originates at the Supervisor to  
    build the network circuit) and ISIS (builds intra-ISIS circuit from

    changes the configuration parameters for an X.25/X.75 slot, using the  
    X.25/X.75 Operations Manager (XOM). The user interface is commands in  
    the form of words rather than hexadecimal code. Also used in the event 
    an X.25/X.75 slot has to be reloaded.
