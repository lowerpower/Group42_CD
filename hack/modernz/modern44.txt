    remote asynchronous computers and terminals that are not subscribers to
    the TYMNET network, over publicly available ports. OutDial can be used 
    to send information from a central computer to remote asynchronous     
    devices, from a PC to another PC, or from a terminal or PC to an       
    asynchronous computer.
