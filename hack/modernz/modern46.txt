          How to Grow Pot in Your Dorm Closet for Pennies and Ounce!

	Prices suck nowadays. In the good old days, when we were all sucking on 
baby bottles instead of bongs, pot went for $50 an ounce! Nowadays, your
lucky if you can get a quarter for $50. This rise in prices could be 
attributed to one of many conspiracy theories, the mob is causing unnatural
inflation by hoarding the stuff, the C.I.A.'s Afghani connections have
dried up since the war, the Kennedys smoked it all during the '60's (when
not raping women), etc. The real reason is greed. People can make money,
and they want to make lots. Think about all the people that have touched your
bag before you bought it, selling it at a higher price each time it changes
hands.


	            Cut out the middleman! Here's How!

	Grow it yourself. It doesn't take much time, and the plant does most
of the work.  Its good for the environment!  You just have to give it water,
light and a little tender loving care. As you will also see, a dorm room is
the perfect place to grow. I'll show you how to turn your closet into a garden
of earthly delights, and where to steal the things you need.
Most are common household items!

Steps to a higher future:
1. Find seeds. Well, at the bottom of every bag of pot is seeds. So, there you
   go. If you have a problem finding them, drop a letter to the Livingston 
   Medium, include an envelope and your box number. I'll have the seeds sent
   to you in time for the Spring harvest.

2. Buy soil. I highly recommend buying soil instead of digging up some of
   the red mud around here. Your plant will be much happier if you go down
   to the Foodtown on Easton Ave. and buy a bag for five bucks. While your
   there, pick up a planter, about the size of a gallon jug. Make sure there's
   holes in the bottom. Marajuana plants need lots of drainage.

3. How to plant seeds. Plant lots. Put them in the soil about an inch deep, 
   about an inch away from the sides and each other. Keep the soil moist,
   water it every day, until the sprouts come up. There are other ways
   to get the plants to sprout, like putting the seeds in moist paper
   towels, like the way you get beans to grow. I haven't had much success
   with that, or any other way except just sticking them in dirt.

4. Light, water, and food. Light is a special subject and will be explored
   fully by itsself. As for water, pot plants need a lot of water when they
   are growing, because they grow like, excuse the pun, weeds. Don't 
   overwater, thats just as bad. Try watering just when the plant seems to
   need it. You can tell because the ends of the leaves will start drooping
   a little. Feed a plant rarely, and sparsely. Many a crop has been killed
   by an overzealous farmer. I understand the tendency to give the plant
   lots to eat, but, for one, if you went out and bought soil, there should
   be enough nutrients in there for it to grow well enough, and, for two,
   miracle grow is cocaine for plants. It'll kill itself if you give it too
   much. Feed it like half the dose it says on the miracle grow box, like
   a month into its life. It should be at least a foot tall when it gets its
   first feeding.


		    Light for an Indoor Plant, for Free!

	You will notice that the desk in your dorm room has a fluorescent
tube in it. Perfect! The Marajuana Grower's Guide says that fluorescent
lights are good, but they don't deliver much light from the red end of the
spectrum. This can be remedied by supplementing with a couple of incandescent
lights. To take the lights from the desk, you will need a phillips
head screwdriver and some sort of wedge. First unplug the light. You dont
want to die before you get a chance to enjoy the fruits of your labor.
Then take out the bulb by twisting. It should just fall out. Next, the cover
behind the light just snaps out (use the wedge, or anything like a flat head
screwdriver). You will see two big phillips head wood screws fastenting the
ballast to the desk. Take out the screws, (but don't loose them, you'll need
them later) and voila! you have your light. Do this to both desks, if your
roommate protests, kill him. Now, you need to place the hardware where it 
is cool, very dark at night, and inconspicious to fire inspectors. Can you
guess where? Your closet. Screw the lights to the underside if the shelf in
the closet. The wood screws should go right in to the cheap wood Rutgers uses.
Put your dresser in your closet so you can keep the plants very close to the
lights, and since your roommate is now dead, burn his clothes, and put all your
stuff in his closet. You should also think about getting some grow lights
for the ballasts, since the fluorescent tubes in the desks now are made for
reading, not for plant growing. I was in New York the other day, and there was
this light bulb store on Broadway, about 2 blocks south of Tower Records. I saw
3ft grow lights for $9.95. Pretty reasonable. I thought they would be going
for about a hundred. 
	Since electricity is basically free in a dorm, for the first few
months, keep the lights on constantly. You can use aluminum foil to reflect
the light back. The light escaping through the cracks in the door should be
enough to keep you awake at night, so use something to keep it in the closet.
When the growth slows down, the plant is becoming a sexually mature adult.
Give it 12 hours on, 12 hours off. When it stops growing completely, start 
decreasing its light. What you are doing is simulating the shortening of
the day as winter approaches. After two weeks, of say, 6 hours/day of light,
you plants should be budding. Dry out the buds and smoke up, man.

		      Don't dilly-dally, start now!

	Now to tally up the total cost. Aluminum foil stolen from home, or
from some girl down the hall, Soil $5, Grow lights $20, electricity $0,
planter $1, Miracle Grow (optional) $5. So the total maximum cost is
$31! The capital outlay is peanuts compared to the return. You know where it
comes from, so it won't be laced with Black Flag or Drano. I would say sell
it, but that isn't the point of growing. If anything, give it away. You are,
by growing, trying to eliminate greed and return to values that are 
intrinisically part of pot smoking: brotherhood, sharing, and good times.
So pass it around, It'll just come back to you.
