                  UK EDI SERVICE PLANNED FOR NEXT YEAR

LONDON, England, November 19, 1990 -- Plans for British-based Electronic Data
Interchange (EDI), the direct computerPtoPcomputer transfer of orders, invoices
and statements, were announced by British Telecom, foreshadowing its
introduction next year.
     EDI can significantly cut the cost of business transactions by eliminating
two expensive and time consuming processes:
      -manual transfer of paper documents from one location to another, and
      -rekeying of data generated by computer at the sending location into a 
	 second computer at the destination.  
     With EDI, transaction details can be transferred electronically between
companies, greatly improving business efficiency. And when, in the future, EDI
in the UK is implemented in full, with payment as well as documents being sent
electronically, cash management is significantly improved.
     The service being planned for next year will use the EDI*Net system,
developed and operated by BT Tymnet in the USA, where it is one of the market
leaders. Access will be available throughout Europe over the recently launched
Global Network Service (GNS), British Telecom's worldwide value-added data
network.
     British Telecom will use UN/EDIFACT as its preferred message standard for
EDI for corporate applications.  However, the commercial EDI*Net will support
all the major EDI message standards. Ultimately, British Telecom plans to
migrate to the internationally agreed X.400 standard for messaging, run over the
X.25 communications protocol.
     Recognizing that the adoption of EDI is a major step, British Telecom will,
as part of its service, assist its customers with overall implementation.  It is
already doing this with EDIstart, a PC-based EDI software package developed in
conjunction with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and designed
specifically for the motor industry.
     Mr. David Dey, Managing Director of British Telecom's Business
Communications Division, commented:  "When we launch EDI*Net next year, we shall
offer our customers an electronic VAN (value added network) to replace their use
of the mail van. The planned service is a direct result of British Telecom's
acquisition of the Tymnet business a year ago.
     "In ten short months we integrated Tymnet's value-added data networks in
the USA and elsewhere with our own UK and international data networks to enable
us to offer our customers GNS round the world.  GNS will provide the access for
EDI customers in the UK and Europe.
     "British Telecom is no stranger to EDI. We already operate bespoke systems
tailored to users' needs in ACP 90, which serves the air cargo community, and in
CHIEF, the system which enables HM Customs  and Excise to keep track of the
country's import  and export trade. We have also secured contracts with Swissair
and Tandem Computers to develop a major new interactive EDI project for
airlines. There is a substantial and growing use of our electronic mail service,
Telecom Gold, for low-level EDI transaction", added Dey.
     British Telecom has already started to implement EDI using EDI*Net
technology in dealings with its suppliers as part of its #8.5 million a day
procurement program.  Trials which started in March with in-house traders have
now been extended to involve third-party suppliers.
     Further details of the new EDI service and plans for its implementation
will be announced during the next six months. British Telecom will also be
directly briefing its major customers and suppliers.

                 BT TYMNET REVEALS EDI*Net DEVELOPMENTS

       EDI*Net Experiences Over 45% Growth in Customers and Revenues


WASHINGTON, D.C., December 3, 1990 --  BT Tymnet, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
British Telecommunications plc, revealed today recent developments regarding
their EDI*Net (R) service from the EDIA Conference and Exhibit in Washington,
D.C..
     BT Tymnet's EDI*Net, available since 1981, pioneered the concept of third
party EDI network service with the Uniform Communication Standard (UCS) pilot
program for the grocery industry. EDI*Net growth is evidenced by its customer
base which has increased by 47% from 1989 to 1990. Accordingly, EDI*Net revenues
have increased by 45% during the same period.
     EDI*Net allows application-to-application transmission of business data in
a public standard format. EDI*Net enables customers to transmit and receive
purchase orders, shipping notices, and many other standard business documents
across industries. This capability, in turn, reduces the flow of paper between
partners, resulting in smaller inventories, shorter sales cycles and fewer
administrative costs.


HARDWARE VENDOR ALLIANCES

     As part of its hardware vendor alliance strategy, BT Tymnet has certified
DECEDI, the EDI hardware platform of Digital Equipment Corporation. The hardware
alliance means that third party companies developing applications (eg.-
accounting systems, manufacturing systems, translation software) using Digital's
hardware platform interface will be certified on EDI*Net.
      In addition to Digital's DECEDI, BT Tymnet is also certifying the Unisys
EaDI and the Tandem Non-Stop EDI hardware platforms.
     From a translation software perspective, BT Tymnet is the only EDI
value-added network that is unalligned. This allows companies to choose the
translation options that best fits their industry and hardware requirements,
unlike all other EDI VANs offer their own translation software. Currently, the
EDI*Net Certified Translation Software program includes over 25 translation
software packages.


NEXT GENERATION HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY

     British Telecom is committed to EDI and has made a multi-million dollar
investment in the redevelopment of their message-switching host software to run
on fault-tolerant Tandem hardware. The move to migrate the EDI*Net customer base
from IBM to Tandem has already begun.
     Benefits of migrating EDI*Net to the Tandem hardware are:
	*Improved production quality due to Tandem's Non-Stop technology.
	*Additional security with each mailbox having a separate password.
	*Improved operations interface (windows vs. line-by-line)
	*Improved customer service due to the availability of more tools.
	*Increased functionality- foundation for applications such as SNA
	 access, EDIFACT exchange, X.400 communications and priority interval 
	 delivery.


NETWORK EXPANSION

     EDI*Net receives and delivers messages through the world's largest global
network, TYMNET (R).  BT Tymnet recently announced the availability of British
Telecom's Global Network Services (GNS) which resulted from the merger of the
TYMNET Network and British Telecom's UK network (MNS). The GNS announcement
included the addition of nine new countries, bringing the total to 20 countries
with direct access to the network. GNS will eventually allow BT Tymnet to
implement EDI*Net in those countries.
     Another major announcement in 1990 was the upgrade of over 200 access sites
in the U.S. to 2400 bps. The upgrade brought the total number of domestic 2400
bps access sites to over 450. In addition to more convenient access to the
TYMNET Network, there is also a significant reduction in the time it takes for
an EDI*Net user to send data.


BT TYMNET INC.

     BT Tymnet Inc., an international value-added network supplier, is one of
the world's largest providers of public, private, and hybrid network solutions.
The company owns and operates the TYMNET Network which offers protocol
conversion, error-protection, enhanced security features, electronic data
interchange (EDI), electronic transaction services (point-of-sale), and
electronic messaging. The TYMNET Network is accessible from most countries
throughout the world.
