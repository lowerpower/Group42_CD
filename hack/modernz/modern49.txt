	        	A Rant to the Modern Man

  	The '60s were a generation of rallying, rebellion, and social

strife. People were at each others throats. The young against the old,

Timothy Leary against G. Gordon Liddy, Hanoi Jane against Nixon and Manson

against everybody. Things were in turmoil. The sixties will be remembered

as the puberty of America. The straight, sexless hips of the '50s finially

got a few kinks in them. Kerouac was its first kiss. Vietnam was

its first zit, which grew into a full, ugly case of acne. The youth of

that generation wanted out. They didn't like all the testosterone that

was flowing around, created during World  War II, and it just didn't go

away. Instead, it was just redirected into Korea and Vietnam.

	You can just ask a whole country of people to go home and stop fighting.

The youth of the '60s were born after 1945 and didn't know the war, and

weren't to interested to know, either. They knew what they were fighting

against, it was obvious to all sides. They hated the war, they hated the

man, and they hated hate. They wanted a change to a more realistic world

from the sugar coated '50s. To accomplish something on such a grand

scale seemed reasonable. People were motovated to do something, to

instill change.

	The '70s were another story altogether. It has been called the

"Me Generation". I guess that's true. The people of the '60s, while

getting some things done, lost the dream. They got fed up. Out of this

frustration groups like the Black Panthers and the Weathermen were

created. The Weatherman were a radical group that wanted to get the

government out of the war by blowing it up. Their Greenwich Village flat

blew up due to amateur bombmaking in 1971. At one of their meetings, the

question put to the floor was "Should all white male children be killed

at birth because, in later life they would just continue the tradition

of opression of minorities?" The pure peace and love of the '60s were

turned into the hatred and bloodshed of the '70s. The seventies were

truly warped.

	As people started to realize what was going on by the mid '70s,

they found out what really mattered, themselves. The hippies had nothing

to worry about in the '60s. It was a time of general prosperity for the

country. People's pockets weren't hurting. When the arabs found out there

as power in some black gook they pumped from beneath their sands, they

used it. People really started to worry when those 'Damn Towelheads'

took America by its neck. People were inconvenienced. This generation

never knew about that. They grew up with TV, automatic washing machines, 8

cylinder engines, every convenience anyone could ever want. They

thought, "What's going on here? We are saving all this time by having

machines do our laundry and our dishes and I'm going to spend my time

waiting on a damn gas line? Thats not progress! I'm gonna go out and get

me some progress." So people started to not care. The country became

more cynical. They were more out for themselves. They felt threatened and ill

at ease with the fact that something was affecting them directly that

was beyond their control. The isolationism that was no longer possible

on a macroscopic scale was being transferred to the individual. The man in

the '70s was truly an island.

	The '80s were even worse. We were so hung up on TV we gave an

actor the job of running the country. In the '70s we could splurge a

little bit. In the '60s we put a few bucks in our pockets, but in the '70s we

spent it all on BeeGees albums, Buicks and shirts with really, really,

big collars. But we still had our credit cards. Reagan said "Give me, oh

I think 5 new aircraft carriers, you know, the kind with lots of pretty

lights, to get those Ruskies really, really scared. I could use a few

hundred of those MX missles too. You say I really don't need them? What

do you mean? Are you a commie-pinko-liberal too? Nationalism is

fashionable now! So buck up private, the Gipper knows what he's doing

between his naps! And don't worry, I'm gonna put it all on our Visa

anyway, the First Bank of Tokyo just gave me an unlimited line of credit!"   

The good times of the '80s are going to be paid for in the '90s, and well

into the next century. In 1991, we, the people are paying off all the

bank failures from the '80s, because the people in charge were too busy

having a good time.

	People were lied to in the '80s. Remember Ollie North? Remember

the not so false rumor that Reagan said he would give arms to the

Iranians if they kept the hostages until after the election? The C.I.A.?

(enough said). Just read the Village Voice once, you'll see what I mean.

We were swindeled out of our right to know, our money, and hope for the

future in the '80s.

	Aaaah, the present. Not much has been said about the '90s yet. It

being only 1991. As a youth of the '90s, the same age as a hippie in the

sixties, I feel I am in the best position to sum up what the world has

to offer a disillusioned, broke, overstimulated generation.

	For one, the best goddammed entertainment technology has to

offer will be coming to your neighborhood. The stuff coming out now will

curl your hair. Digital, perfect stereo sound is now the rule. Imagine, 

a song, recorded after say, 1989, could not be heard without a computer

digesting it first. Televisions will now be 'High Definition' and in

stereo. You can put a color TV in your pocket.  You can carry around

computers and video games that would give someone with Pac Man Fever

double pnemonia. 4 year olds are better at video games than you, sorry if that

hurts your pride, but they moved out the Space Invaders machine a long,

long time ago. With computers, the entertainment industry has gotten its

most valuable tool.

	You won't realize it though, but all this entertainmant is

generating apathy and the inability for you to feel. You might have the

hand-eye coordination to fly an F-15, but you never will. The couch is

too comfortable, this bag of cheese puffs tastes too good, and Star Wars 6

is rolling in the VCR. I know I'm not going anywhere. You might read

about doing things, but you never will. You have that couch, that

parental safety to fall into, and a complete lack of motovation. Don't

worry about it, things will work out. Dad isn't retiring for another 10

years. There aren't any jobs out there, anyway (as if you looked).

	With all this TV, people will forget how to speak, how to relate

ideas, how to communicate. I don't mean the everyday stuff, anyone can

order a tuna sub with provolone (a staple of a '90s person, who doesn't like

to cook. It tastes ever better if you can get it delivered.) I mean

feelings, real things, and how people feel, really feel. I don't want to

ever hear again the words "Nuthin'" or "Same old shit" or "Allright".

Its all a cop out. Its just another symptom of not being motovated to do

anything. The person asking "Whats up?" really doesn't want to know,

doesn't want to take the energy to know, because that precludes doing

something about what could be wrong, which takes up their energy, which

is low to start with, and their time, which is to be saved at all costs

(see above). And the person answering with one of the above cliches

doesn't want to take the time to explain it all, anyway, beacuse if they

have a problem, it is probably due to their lack of time, or energy.

Telling the problem to someone will just compound it, and it will then

just be a bigger broblem and take longer to explain, ad infinitum. 

	So, all we have to look forward to is bad conversation, cold

cuts and better television than ever seen before in history. Maybe not.

There are some good things. The world is a kinder place. People are still

killing each other about things as silly as the color of their skins,

religion or which is the best economic system, but not as many. America

will still have delusions of grandeur, but there is nothing to get all

worked up about anymore. The Russian hordes aren't about to race into Western

Europe to loot the place, if anything, they'll race there to find jobs.  

Now that the cold war is over, we, as a world, can make this place

better for everyone. It is a small world after all, even smaller with

sattelite links, fiber optic communication, and a telephone system that

allows one to speak with a healthy fraction of the world's population at

any time. 

	Sons and daughters of the '90s, just kick back. Take it easy.

There aren't the riches to be had, the golden ring to grab for. It's a

myth handed to you by the last few generations. Procrastinate. Enjoy the

cheaper things in life. See the world on 5 dollars a day. Watch some TV,

play Nintendo, maybe go out and get a slice and a coke. Get a

girlfriend. After all, sex is free. But don't get AIDS, or else no more

loafing for you.

	The 4 year olds I spoke of before will be the motovated ones. I

am hearing stories about prepubescent fanatic environmentalists. These

children are being taught now that recycling is next to Godliness. This

blind belief that one person can make a difference, is a very refreshing

thing to see. I don't think anyone should get too worked up about

anything, but that is just a symptom of my generation. These kids, with

all the energy, and early indoctrination, will make a difference. For

their children, the world will be a better place. Just in time for us to

retire and collect social security.
