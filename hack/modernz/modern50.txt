		    Getting started on the internet.

The Internet: Too legal to be any fun.



Not true! Not when you have White Sands Missle Range, Picatinny Arsenal,

Fermilab, Livermore Labs, NASA, etc...And thats just the illegal stuff.

The legal stuff consists of endless software, endless information, and

a bulletin board with such newsgroups as "alt.drugs", and 

"rec.weseley.must.die.die.die". There is so much on the internet, you

will never be disinterested. Any question you might have you can ask, 

and you will get answers from people with doctorates in whatever you are

asking. You not only have an encyclopedia online somewhere, you have the

people who wrote the encyclopedia somewhere. Every person with a math,

physics, computer science, chemistry, well, include any person with a 

bachelor dealing with things technical is on the net. 

I am kinda fond of looking at the Ren 'n' Stimpy Gifs at

the remus.rutgers.edu archive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The net is very, very open. you can probably look at 90% of all the

files on the net, that includes personal files. (by ftp).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start, I will deal with dialup access, getting around locally, then

how to talk to people out of their accounts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dialups:

All major universities are linked to the net, and they give out their

dialups freely. So, that is your best bet to get a local number. I have

never seen a 1-800 dialup, I think this is because people who use the

computers work or go to the school in question.

There are also businesses hooked up to the net (sun corporation, some

software companies,etc.) you might want to try some social engineerng or

scanning of exchanges if you cant find a local university dialup.

Universities usually have more open systems, they only add security as

they have to. It is against their mission to restrict the flow of

information, while it is profitable for a corporation to restrict data.


Now that you have you number, and call it, you could be connected to 

one of two things:a network server box or a computer.

Network server box-from here on out called a "Cisco box" from the name of a 

manufacturer of these boxes. These boxes usually let you connect to the 

computers on the local net (like all the computers on whatever campus

you are calling). These boxes are not computers, they might take up some

CPU time of a computer dedicated to the task of running the network

(def- network server). This is a springboard to other computers, there

is no use trying to hack it, it wont crash, and you cant get a shell.
 

I will introduce another concept here. These boxes have names-often

stupid, like huey, duey, and louie. But this denotes 3 cisco boxes on

the same network. Names are what you use to connect to other computers.


They are in the form [computername].[site].[type of site].

"computername" examples are eagle, grape, and babyoil. Examples of sites

are mit, clarkson, and ftp. Types are either edu or com. These are legal

names: eagle.mit.edu, grape.ecs.clarkson.edu, and prefect.cc.bellcore.com. 

They are of that general form. These are labels. you may see a number

like "128.6.6.4". This is equivalent to the label, either one will do,

but it is easier to remember a label, so they are in general use.

Labels are also called nodenames.


The number is a computer's internet address. The numbers get more and

more specific, for example 128 means the northeast, 6 means Rutgers

University, 6 denotes net 6 at rutgers, and 4 is the actual computer

number. It might be useful to play with these numbers.


Here's why:

Say a cisco box is called more.money.com. and its internet address is

122.3.1.4. This cisco wont let you connect with anything outside of the

local net. What you might be able to do is connect to another local

cisco by trying something like "122.3.1.5" or anything else close to the

number. 

Low numbers are almost always cisco boxes. If you can find a cisco that

allows you to call off of the local net, your in business.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's a mud?

Muds: friendly people who **want** to give you their accounts!

A mud, is actually, an adventure game set up on a Unix machine. Its kind of

like an infocom game, except that you and other people walk around the same

alternate universe and can talk and interact with each other. There are other

neat things, like you can make rooms and little universes, but that is

incedental and has nothing do do with getting accounts. 

First read the help files so you can show other people that you know

what you are doing, ask them about their dog, play up to their

intelligence, then ask them for their account, or to trade accounts. You

dont have to give them a real account, just bullshit. Think of the

people who play these games-they are either lonely computer science

students or operators that have nothing better to do. Tell them what they

want to hear, and they will tell you the same. Muds are cool because the

people want to talk to you, they predisposed to be friendly.


How to find muds:

	You don't need an account to login to a mud, but you must find

one first. Your best bet is to call the operator. They are most often

students or people that think computers are "neat", and want to be able

to show other people how much they know.

Now, in addition to the node name, you must give it a port number.

i.e. "quartz.rutgers.edu 6025"

This might be a legal name. The form is correct, but I don't know if

that is actually a mud. The port number is used for connecting to

functions that don't require a shell, like mail. You can connect to the

mail port and send mail to anyone that has an account there, but I'm not

sure how to do it. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Unless you talk someone out of an account, I really don't think you will

be able to hack one out. Most of the computers on the net run unix, so

become familiar with it before you start. Since this is a net file and

not an operating system file, it will not be dealt with here. 

You might try root, sysadm, uucp and see where that gets you, but you

have to realise the people in charge have probably gotten their degrees

at the school they work at, and 1) are not stupid, 2) it has been done

to them before. Believe me, everyone before you have ruined it. It is a

fact that should be assumed before you start. Large and old computer

networks are very entrenched and are tough to crack.


On a cisco you can send messages to other lines on the same cisco. While

this is communication with other people that could lead to an account,

this is also bothering people. If the other party is running something like

an editor, it will fuck with their screen and make them completely

irate. It is not a good idea to flash things on other people's screens

if they don't want you to. But fuck it, if you have no other way. 

To do this can be easily learned from the cisco's help files.

You might also want to try to enable a cisco. At a prompt, type "ena".

You should then get a password: prompt. If you have the password, you

can enable the box, and you will be able to connect to names off of the

local net, and you can send messages to other lines. If you want to hack out

passwords, the best way is to call a local cisco, then give it a

nodename far away, and hack that. That way you will only be traced back

to the cisco, which doesn't have any information on you.   


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


There used to be a guest account at mit, but it was taken down because

of hackers...There might still be guest accounts floating around

somewhere, but I can't find any, and I have a account on the net. You

might be able to get a legal account somehwere, but that requires

information about you, if not money. The best way to start is to call

the computer center, and the systems operator and get a jist of how the

system works at that site. You might want to make a visit to the

computer center and write down some important names to drop later to the

op. There is a human buracracy involved, which is often full of holes. 


Moral: People and their egos are the weakest link in any security.
