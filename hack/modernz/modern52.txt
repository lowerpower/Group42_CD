The Internet...part two:

Contents: Unix and VMS network commands
	  vnews

	Note: this is not an operating systems lesson. It is assumed you
have had a smattering of both unix and vms from reading some othe file.
You are assumed to know how to change directories, specify filenames,
and know a few simple commands. (ls, pwd, who, env, set default [],
cd...)

Network commands:
	Congratulations! You're in! Now what?
Do your best to get another account. This can be accomplished by hacking
other sites. Your account is very tenacious. Your activities are being
recorded, but you can't help that. Try to get a few backup accounts, so
you don't have to waste time if your current one goes down. Its alot
easier to get more accounts while on the inside.
Helpful command number 1:

finger <username>@nodename   Examples: finger joe@remus.rutgers.edu,
				       finger @ai.mit.edu. 
Operating systems implemented on:VMS, unix, prime
If you specify a username, the computer will give you information about
that user, which includes home directory, last time on, maybe even a
nickname, home phone number, and something called a .plan file. This
plan file is written by a user and is printed each time "you finger
him". You can find out information about that person in hopes of hacking
out his password. 
	Without the username, the computer will list all of the people
on line at the time, at the node you specify. You can the finger that
person, and get their info. This way you can get usernames and some
personal information about that person. 

telnet nodename		Examples: telnet pica.army.mil
Implemented on: VMS, unix, prime
	With this command, you try to log into another computer on the
net. You are trying this from an account, so you will be able to "telnet
to" New Jersey from California. This command has nothing to do with
Telenet. You can also telnet locally, but local logins should be
attempted with rlogin first.

rlogin nodename		Example: rlogin babyoil
On unix only.
Rlogin allows you to login to another computer automatically, without
giving a password or a username. It is useful to find out what other
computers this username has an account on, and which computers share
password files. (/etc/passwd)

ftp nodename		Example: ftp grape.ecs.clarkson.edu
Unix, VMS, prime.
FTP stands for file transfer protocol. Its a little like telnet, except
you don't get a normal shell. You use unix commands to move around
directories, but that is where the similarities end.
When you ftp, you get a prompt asking for a username. If you have an
account on the system you are calling, use that information, since it
will give you more access than an anonymous login. If you dont have an
account, try "anonymous" as the username. If this site allows it (most do)
you will have limited, but liberal access to all of the files on the
system.
	Ftp commands:put [filename] and get [filename]
These commands allow you to transfer files to and from accounts. This is
what ftp is used for. Nefariously, you can use it to look at the files
of another person whose account you are trying to hack. 
Scenario: You finger a site, and get a username, you then finger that
site, using that username, to see if the person you are hacking is worth
the time. If so, ftp to the site, and cd to the username's directory. 
Now, you can look at the files he lets the world read, like a resume, or
some stupid bit of prose he thinks is important. By the filenames, you
can tell what kind of account it has. If it has many old files, it is
probably an administrator. If it has fortran, C or pascal source code,
and all of the files are no older than a semester, it is defintely a
student. If the files are somewhere in between, it might be a faculty
member. Faculty members have no privs, but they often keep grades,
exams, or other stuff that might be very valuable to a student in his
class. You can also download cool programs from an archive ftp site to
your local account, and use xmodem or kermit to d/l to your home
computer.      

traceroute nodename		Example: traceroute ucla.edu
unix only
This command lists the hops a packet must go through to reach another
site. With this command, geographical information about a site can be
gained by tracing the route the information goes through, local network
to local network. It is useful to find out where a site is, if the site
name itself does not give out the information. ucla.edu obviously does,
while babyoil.ftp.com does not. 
  
xmodem, kermit 
Unix, vms, prime.
Read the help files on these. It can be used to d/l files to your home
but using the protocol. Different systems have different
implementations of these programs. You might be able to just type
"xmodem" or "kermit", get a transfer prompt, and hit a ? to get quick
help. Obviously, if you have a friend in California, and an account in
New Jersey, you friend in CA could upload to his local site, then you
could ftp the files to your account in a matter of seconds, like 3 megs
a second when the net isn't busy. Then just d/l with xmodem, (dont use
kermit for binary, it doesn't check errors as well). This way you can
avoid paying Ma bell, the coast to coast transfer is error free, and
can be done at your leisure. The programs can be transfered anytime
after they are uploaded to the net. Also, the archive sites are good for
getting the lastest versions of pkunzip, qmodem, or any other staple
piece of shareware you use all of the time (like this text editor I'm
using). 

********************************* VNEWS **************************************

vnews					Example: vnews
Unix, vax, or any system it is implemented on
	Vnews is the largest bulletin board EVER. On this board can be
found Ph. D.'s talking about everything from computers to politics to
how to make a really cool bong. Its the best place to ask any question,
any you will get someone with at least 8 years of college education
answering it. It has a worldwide classified ads board, in addition to
the ones just for the local system, and the local state. 
	Vnews is good to get information where there are good archive
sites, guest accounts, anything you heart can dream of. Its kind of like
heaven... all questions are answered there. All you have to do is ask.
	In my account, I have a file that lists all of the newsgroups.
It's 23K!
	You can get people's usernames and the node they are calling
from, which they conveniently give you at the end of their posts.
The legal and illegal potentials are endless. Use your imagination.
	After you type vnews, hit the ? key...that will give you the
help screen. Note: you must be emulating the same terminal the dialup
is. Otherwise, it will look all fucked up. Get a terminal that emulates
vt100 or vt52 really well, then you'll be set.
