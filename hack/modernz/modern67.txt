===========================================================================
		       Altered System Binaries Incident

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information regarding a series of significant intrusion incidents on 
the Internet.  Systems administrators should be aware that many 
systems on the Internet have been compromised due to this activity.  
To identify whether your systems have been affected by the
activity we recommend that all system administrators check for the
signs of intrusion detailed in this advisory.

This advisory describes the activities that have been identified as
part of this particular incident.  This does not address the
possibility that systems may have been compromised due to other,
unrelated intrusion activity.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     The intruders gain initial access to a host by discovering a
     password for a user account on the system, exploiting a "+" in 
     the "/etc/hosts.equiv" file, or any ".rhosts" files on the
     system.  The intruder then connects to the system using rsh and
     attempts to become root on the compromised system.  An alias of
     "decode" may used to gain root privileges.

II.  Impact
	
     Having gained root access on a system, the intruders may make
     unauthorized changes to system binaries that can capture account
     information for both local and remote systems.  In addition, the
     intruder adds "+ +" to any ".rhosts" files to which the intruder
     has access.

III. Solution 

     A. Check your systems for signs of intrusion due to this incident.

        1. Check the login, telnet, and uucpd binaries (for example,
	   "/bin/login", "/usr/ucb/telnet", and "/usr/etc/in.uucpd" on
	   Sun systems) against copies from distribution media.  Note that
	   a check for creation or modification times and sizes is
	   not sufficient to assure that the files have not been modified.
	   The CERT/CC suggests that you compare the output of the
           "sum(1)" or "cmp(1)" command on both the distribution and
           installed versions of the binaries.

        2. If the check from (A.1) indicates that your binaries have been
	   modified, check for the presence of a password
	   log file.  Since the name of the logfile is often changed,
	   the name of the file should be obtained using the
	   "strings(1)" command on the Trojan login, uucpd, or telnet
	   binary.  Examples of filenames used on other systems are:

                               "/usr/spool/. " (dot space)
                               "/var/spool/secretmail/.l"
                               "/var/spool/secretmail/.log"
                               "/var/spool/secretmail/.tty"
                               "/var/spool/secretmail/.lock"
                               "/usr/tmp/.log"
                               "/usr/spool/uucp/.sys"
                               "/usr/spool/uucppublic/.hushlogin"
			       "/usr/uucp/.sys"
                               "/mnt2/lost+found/.tmp/.log"
                               "/usr/spool/mqueue/.AFG001"

	   Verify that the contents of files found using the "strings(1)"
	   command do not contain valid username/password combinations.  

        3. Check for the presence of "+" in the "/etc/hosts.equiv"
	   file.  

	   NOTE that Sun Microsystems installs the SunOS
	   operating system with a default "+" in the /etc/hosts.equiv
	   file for easy network access.  This should be removed
	   unless required in your operating environment and protected
	   by a firewall network configuration.  Leaving the "+"
	   intact will allow any non-root user on the Internet to
	   login to the system without a password.

        4. Check the home directory for each entry in the "/etc/passwd"
           file for the presence of a ".rhosts" file containing
           "+ +" (plus space plus).

        5. Assure that your "/etc/fstab", "/etc/inetd.conf", and
	   "/etc/exports" files have not been modified.

     B. Take the following steps to secure your systems.

        1. Save copies of the identified files to removable media and 
	   remove any password log files as found in (A.2) above.

        2. Replace any modified binaries with copies from
           distribution media.

        3. Remove the "+" entry from the "/etc/hosts.equiv"
	   file and the "+ +" (plus space plus) entry from any
	   ".rhosts" files.  

        4. Change ownership of the "/etc" directory to userid "root"
	   if it is owned by "bin" (as distributed by Sun).
           
        5. Change every password on the system and assure that the new 
	   passwords are robust using a package such as Crack or Cops
	   (available via anonymous ftp from cert.org).

	6. Inspect and restore any changes made to your "/etc/fstab", 
	   "/etc/exports", or "/etc/inetd.conf" files.  If any
	   modifications are found in these files, you will need to
	   unmount file systems and restart daemons once the files
	   have been restored.  Alternatively the system could be
	   rebooted.
	
	7. Remove the "decode" alias from your global mail aliases
	   file ("/etc/aliases" on Sun systems, "/usr/lib/aliases" on
	   other UNIX systems).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM/IMPACT:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Unauthorized privileges may be expanded to authorized users of a system
     under certain conditions, via the Monitor utility.   Should a system be
     compromised through unauthorized access, there is a risk of potential
     damage to a system environment.  This problem will not permit unauthorized
     access entry, as individuals attempting to gain unauthorized access will
     continue to be denied through the standard VMS security mechanisms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOLUTION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This potential vulnerability does not exist in VMS V5.4-3
     (released in October 1991) and later versions of VMS through V5.5-1.

     Digital strongly recommends that you upgrade to a minimum of VMS V5.4-3,
     and further, to the latest release of VMS V5.5-1. (released in July, 1992)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INFORMATION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     If you cannot upgrade at this time Digital recommends that you
     implement a workaround (examples attached below) to avoid any potential
     vulnerability.

     As always, Digital recommends that you periodically review your system
     management and security procedures.  Digital will continue to review and
     enhance the security features of its products and work with customers to
     maintain and improve the security and integrity of their systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKAROUND
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     A suggested workaround would be to remove the installed image
     SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE via VMS INSTALL and/or restrict the use of
     the MONITOR utility to "privileged" system administrators.
     Below are the examples of doing both;

[1]  To disable the MONITOR utility the image SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE should be
     deinstalled.

    From a privileged account;

    For cluster configurations;
    ---------------------------

    $ MC SYSMAN
    SYSMAN> SET ENVIRONMENT/CLUSTER
    SYSMAN> DO INSTALL REMOVE SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE
    SYSMAN> DO RENAME SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE   SPISHR.HOLD
    SYSMAN> EXIT

    For non-VAXcluster configurations;
    ---------------------------------

    $INSTALL
    INSTALL>REMOVE SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE
    INSTALL>EXIT
    $RENAME SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE SPISHR.HOLD


[2] If you wish to restrict access to the MONITOR command so that only a
    limited number of authorized (or privileged) persons are granted access
    to the utility, one method might be to issue the following
    example commands;

        From a privileged account;

    For cluster configurations;
    ---------------------------

    $ MC SYSMAN
    SYSMAN> SET ENVIRONMENT/CLUSTER
    SYSMAN> DO INSTALL REMOVE SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE
    SYSMAN> DO SET FILE/ACL=(ID=*,ACCESS=NONE) SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE
    SYSMAN> DO SET FILE/ACL=(ID=SYSTEM,ACCESS=READ+EXECUTE) SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE
    SYSMAN> DO INSTALL ADD SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE/OPEN/HEADER/SHARE/PROTECT
    SYSMAN> EXIT
    $
        THIS WILL IMPACT the MONITOR UTILITY FOR REMOTE MONITORING.
        LOCAL MONITORING WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR PERSONS HOLDING THE ID's
        GRANTED ACL ACCESS.

see additional note(s) below

    For non-VAXcluster configurations;
    ----------------------------------

    $ INSTALL
    INSTALL>REMOVE SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE
    INSTALL>EXIT
    $ SET FILE /ACL=(ID=*,ACCESS=NONE) SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE
    $ SET FILE /ACL=(ID=SYSTEM,ACCESS=READ+EXECUTE) SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE
    $ INSTALL
    INSTALL>ADD SYS$SHARE:SPISHR.EXE/OPEN/HEADER/SHARE/PROTECT
    INSTALL>EXIT
    $

    IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLES, THE "SET FILE /ACL" LINE SHOULD BE REPEATED FOR
    ALL ACCOUNTS THAT ARE REQUIRED/ALLOWED TO USE THE DCL MONITOR COMMAND.

    NOTE: The ID -SYSTEM- is an example, and should be
           substituted as necessary with valid user ID's that are
           associated with accounts you wish to grant access to.
