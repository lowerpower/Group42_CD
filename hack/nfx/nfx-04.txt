Gas Tank Blues


        Equipment:
        
Wooden bowl                     Paper towel
Wooden spoon                    Glass bottle
Blender                         Gel Capsule
Funnel                          Plastic container
Coffee filter                   Sublimed Sulfur
2 Cups of hot water             Methscopolamine Nitrate
Paper plate

        Procedure:
        
1.  Mix one part Methscopolamine Nitrate and two parts Sublimed Sulfur into
the wood bowl. (Total: 3/4 cup of powder)
2.  Mix the powders together with the wooden spoon until all the lumps are
ground into a very fine powder.
3.  Pour 3/4 a cup of the powder into the blender and add the two cups of hot
water.
4.  Blend the substance until the powder is completely saturated in the
water.
5.  While the substance is being mixed by the blender take a coffee filter
and lay it flat to form a circle.
6.  Fold the filter by fourths into a triangle and place it in the funnel.
7.  Place the funnel with the filter in the neck of the bottle.
8.  Turn off the blender and pour the yellowish liquid into the funnel (with
the filter present)
9.  If you folded the filter correctly a mushy yellow powder shall form in
the funnel.
10.  Remove the funnel from the neck of the bottle and throw the bottle with
the liquid away.
11.  Take the paper towel and place it on the paper plate.
12.  Remove the filter from the funnel and spread the mushy yellow powder
evenly on the plate that contains the paper towel.
13.  Let the powder sun dry for one full day or until the substance is dry.
14.  Make sure that the substance is fully dry.  Test this by letting the
powder fall from your hand, if the powder forms clumps then you should retry
step 13.
15.  Pack the powder tightly into the gel capsule without breaking the
capsule itself.
16.  Store the capsules in a dry place for further use.
17.  Store any extra powder in a plastic container.


        Use:
        
      When placed into a gas tank of any motor vehicle the gel capsule will be
dissolved, when the gas makes contact with the powder it will expand and form
a very hard substance.  When the car is started and the gas, along with
substance, is pumped through the system more damage will occur than if you
placed sugar or sand in the gas tank.  If the car is not started then the
substance will begin to eat away at the metal of the gas tank, thus causing
damage and having the victim not being able to replace gas into his tank
until he or she has it fixed.

Astrolite

     Astrolite is a liquid explosive known as the most explosive reaction
known to man short of a nuclear explosion.  Astrolite is a clear, odor-less
compound formed by the mixing of Ammonium Nitrate and Anhydrous Hydrazine to
form Astrolite-G and the addition of fine mesh Aluminum to form Astrolite
A-1-5.  It is considered moderately to fairly stable and retains its
explosivity even when mixed with other substances.  If Astrolite is poured
into sand, its qualities are unchanged and a liquid land mine is formed. 
Astrolite is detonated by electric charge, but unpredictable results may
develop if exposed to flame or heat including sporadic burning and
explosions.
     Due to the nature of the chemicals involved and their relative toxicity,
MSDS sheets have been consulted and important information has been taken from
them.

Instructions for the Formation of Astrolite 

Astrolite G
     ** All measurements are by weight **
2:1 chemical ratio

2 Parts Ammonium Nitrate to 1 Part Anhydrous Hydrazine

1. Put the 2 parts Ammonium Nitrate in a large beaker with sufficient space
to accommodate the bubbling reaction with the addition of Anhydrous
Hydrazine.
2. Slowly and carefully add the Anhydrous Hydrazine.
3. The effervescent reaction liberates ammonia gas.
4. When the reaction slows, stir carefully and slowly for at least 5 minutes.
5. The Astrolite G is finished.

The compound formed is Hydrazonium Nitrate.

Astrolite A-1-5

     Add to the Ammonium Nitrate 20% by weight of the Ammonium Nitrate 100
mesh or finer Aluminum.
Astrolite A-1-5 has a higher power than Astrolite G due to electrons donated
by the Aluminum, but has a lesser velocity than Astrolite G.

AS/400 Product Line

      IBM's relatively new line of midrange 'computing solutions' are rapidly
gaining acceptance in medium- to large- sized businesses.  This article
provides a quick rundown on the AS/400 models currently in production and
some common software products.  However, most business-specific applications
seem to be either custom-written or vertical-market types provided by IBM. 
This article deals with the D models.  Note: Each successive model entry
builds on the last in the same processor line.  In other words, within the
9404 processor models, the D25 has all the features of the D20, and the D20
has all the features of the D10.  Also, DASD is a form of a hard drive
storage array.  The AS/400s are built at IBM's Rochester, Minnesota facility.

      AS/400 9402              Models D04 and D06

      These two models are a 'low-cost introduction' to the AS/400 line.  Both
come with 8 Mb of RAM standard, an 800-Mb DASD (Direct Access Storage
Device), a 120-Mb quarter-inch tape backup, a communications adapter and
either a twinax or an ASCII workstation controller.  (Twinax is a type of
cabling.)   The D04 is expandable to 16MB RAM, 1.6GB DASD, and up to 28
twinax or 12 ASCII workstations.  The D06 supports up to 20MB of RAM, 1.6GB
DASD, and up to 54 workstations.  They are both slightly smaller than a tower
AT system. 
      The base price for the D04 is $12,500, and the base D06 costs $16,500.

      AS/400 9404              Models D10, D20, D25

      These three models are the low- to mid-range of the AS/400 line.  The
D10 comes with 8 MB standard, and is expandable to 32MB.  It includes a 525Mb
quarter-inch tape backup and 800Mb of DASD.  The DASD is expandable to 4.8GB. 
Optionally, the D04 can handle 80 local twinax workstations, 72 ASCII
workstations, and two LAN connections.  The D20 is a D10 with RAM
expandability to 40MB, thereby increasing the machine's transaction
capability.  The D25 allows for memory expandability to 64MB, thanks to a
32MB main storage card.  The D20 and D25 have a sister tower about as large
as the main unit, the same size as the D04.  The D25 has a box-like
protrusion on the top of the sister tower.
      The base prices are $14,600 for the D10, $28,500 for the D12, and
$61,900 for the D25.

      AS/400 9406              Models D35, D45, D50, D60, D70 and D80

      These six models are the top of the AS/400 line, ranging in size from
the 'five-drawer file cabinet' size of the D35 to the 'large' D80, probably
about 6 feet high, 4 feet deep and 30 feet long.  All six are rack-mounted
and come with two communication lines standard, one used for 'Electronic
Customer Support,' another IBM 'innovation.'  They have standard battery
backup and 1.28GB of DASD storage.  They use fiber-optic buses, which allow
for higher speeds and the capability to place DASD storage units up to 100
meters away from the CPU.
      The D35's RAM can be expanded up to 72MB of RAM, 28.7GB of DASD, and
supports up to 240 local workstations, 16 communications lines, 4 LANS and up
to 8 optical dataservers (probably jukeboxes), each with a capacity of
19.5GB.  It also supports two direct bus connections.
      The D45 can be expanded to support up to 400 local twinax workstations,
8 optical dataservers and 32 communications lines.  According to IBM's
estimate, the D45 handles up to 45% more transactions than the D35.
      The D50 has a 128MB RAM capacity. along with DASD expandability of
49.3GB.  It supports up to 600 twinax workstations, 4 LANs, 32 communication
lines, 14 optical dataservers and 3 bus connections.  All models starting
with the D50 also use "high-speed, intelligent memory," probably a processor
cache.
      The D60 is expandable to 192MB RAM, 76.7GB of DASD storage, 800 twinax
workstations, 4 LANs, 32 communication lines, 14 optical dataservers and 5
bus connections.
      The D70 is expandable up to 256MB RAM, 76.7GB of DASD, and supports DASD
mirroring for a maximum DASD capacity of 38.3GB, if the system is fully
mirrored.  It supports up to 1200 twinax workstations and 48 communication
lines.
      The D80 is the top of IBM's AS/400 line, incorporating not only 2,000
local twinax workstations, 64 communication lines, 124.3GB of DASD, 384MB of
main memory and up to seven bus connections, but also IBM's N-WAY
Multiprocessor Architecture, which consists of two processors 'arranged in
parallel fashion.'  (I'd guess it's a shared-memory system.)
      Base prices: D35, $30,000; D45, $62,700; D50, $105,000; D60, $200,000;
D70, $310,000; D80, $595,000.

      Operating System/400

      The OS/400 product is the 'only IBM-supported' operating system that the
AS/400 line runs on.  Currently up to version 2 release 1, OS/400 supports
SAA, mirroring, auxiliary DASD storage pools, and concurrent maintenance
(allowing malfunctioning hard drives to be replaced while the mirrored system
stays online).

      Summary

      Many important and interesting applications run on AS/400s, such as
Callpath/400 or perhaps the ATM Network application.  They are definitely
worth looking into.  A list of commands for OS/400 can be found on Angel
Station or Secret Society. (See the list above this article of NFX
Distribution Sites.)                                                        ><

Cracking Confidentials

     Welcome to a new corner in the newsletter this month.  I have decided to
start posting some info about the IBM Pirate world in addition to the Phreak
world info that is available here.  What I hope to due in the future is offer
you the chance to see what new games are out and what new games are planning
to come out.
     Well the long-awaited "Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe" is out now. 
After over nine months of delays Lucasfilm has finally started shipping copies
of the game directly out to customers. You can order it directly by calling
1-800-STARWARS, and it should retail at around $40 from what I have heard. 
Also expected to ship this month is Mega Fortress, which is based on the book
"Flight of the Old Dog."
     Origin Systems has also announced that Wing Commander 2 is due out on
software shelves of Babbages stores by the end of the month. This comes after
much hyping of the game and a push back of a few months.
     America On-Line has also introduced a new D&D on-line game. You must
download from them the game and then run it external from the AOL software
that they provide to you. It allows you to operate in the familiar AD&D Gold Box
environment that SSI has made very popular. The game cost $19.95 to down, but
there is no additional charge to play it on-line. You are also supposed to be
able to interact with other players that are on-line in a real-time
environment to allow groups to explore the game together.
     Rumors have that due to America On-Line's interactive graphical games,
Genie also has similar plans in the works. It seems that they have 
contracted Kesmai to develop a new multi-play MechWarrior to run on the Genie
network.  It is supposed to encompass some of the politics between the houses
and it is supposed to allow players to join and form units to accomplish 
missions or simply challenge other players to duels.  There is even supposed
to be a way to announce these challenges over the net and allow players to place
bets on the outcome for more gaming money.  Apparently it is being play-
tested on a VAX right now.
     There is also going to be a Harpoon on-line multi-player game on Genie. 
It seems that Don Gilman, who is the creator of the PC version, has play-tested
it and is quite impressed with the work. There is no word at this time though
when it will be made available to the public.
     It seems that Data East has picked up the license from FASA to create a
computer game of their popular Shadowrun cyberpunk role-playing game. Also
speaking of cyberpunk games, Dynamix was please enough with the response they
got from Rise of the Dragon, that they are planning on going to do a sequel
to it.

     Here is a list of the new games that have come out in the last few
months.

      Baron Majette, the first person to be charged in the Operation Sundevil
investigation, was sentenced last week to 120 days in a "shock incarceration"
center and five years' probation and was ordered to pay restitution of nearly
$20,000.  Majette, who authorities said used the handle of Doc Savage, was
charged in March with telephone and credit-card fraud, among other crimes. 
Majette pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of a single felony in May. 
(Computerworld, July 22, 1991)
      Better erase all those pirated copies of Autocad -- Autodesk, the maker
of the computer-aided design package, has been busting organizations right
and left.  One of the more prominent is Southern Technical College, which
among other penalties, was forced to pay a "six-figure settlement" to
Autodesk.
      Borland has recently purchased Ashton-Tate, the maker of dBase.
      Comsec, the security firm founded by former members of the Legion of
Doom, recently social-engineered several security firms, claiming to be an
executive from Landmark Graphics, a Houston, TX-based software publisher.
      A Next computer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation was recently
hacked into through rexd (a remote-execution daemon), according to Effector. 
      Apple Computer has put in a request to the FCC to allocate the 1850 to
1990 MHz band for its wireless LAN, called Data-PCS.  This frequency band, in
contrast to the 18-GHz band used by the Altair LAN, is a lot easier to
interfere with or monitor.
      Automatic teller machines, or ATMs, exchange data at 2400 BPS over a
packet network.  The machines change their DES-based encryption keys every 10
minutes, based on an initial seed value supplied in a call by the net handler
when the machine powers up.
      CompuCom is selling a $200 module for their modems that will
automatically supply Caller ID information to the computer when called.
      LTC Telephone, which serves Texas, Massachusetts, Nevada, and New
Mexico, has been calling around recently to inquire about calls that could be
'double-billed,' and asking if the callee can supply the phone number and/or
name of the person that called them.
      THG has been busted by Novell.  Two THG boards are down, Red Dot and
Wishlist, and THG thinks there are more busts planned.
      Knight Lightning has graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia,
and is going off to Washington D.C. to be an EFF (Electronic Frontier
Foundation) lobbyist.
      The FCC has voted 5-0 to relax regulation on AT&T's long-haul
communication products, such as the ASDS line and private digital lines.
      AT&T is taking a $1.5 billion writeoff to modernize its PBX product line
in response to challenges from Northern Telecom in the form of its Meridian
One Option 11 PBX (mentioned in NFX #2).  AT&T is discontinuing the Merlin 2,
Merlin Plus, and the System 25 low-end PBXs, along with the mid-range System
75 and 85 switches.  The new AT&T low/mid-range PBX, the Merlin Legend, is
capable of interfacing with AT&T's high-end Definity switches.
      The U.S. Government is expected to file its response to a lawsuit lodged
against law enforcers in the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Secret
Service and a security chief at Bellcore.  The suit, which cites a variety of
First- and Fourth-Amendment violations, was filed by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation in May.  
      The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would impose
criminal penalties for software copyright infringement.  The bill would
impose a fine of up to $250,000 and a prison term of up to two years for
illegal reproduction or distribution of 11 to 49 software copies.  Currently,
first-time piracy is a misdemeanor.  (Both from Computerworld, August 12,
1991)
      In a brilliant display of true IBM foresight, IBM is discontinuing the
8514/A graphics card on Oct. 2, because it has been outmoded (quite
literally) by IBM's XGA card.                                               ><

"The U.S.S.R. and rolling..."

      News: We've dropped our subscription price $10!  Since it's now cheaper
for us to copy it, it's now cheaper for you to buy it.  Check out the header
for more info.

      The Soviet Union (if it's still a union at the time I'm writing this) is
starting to dip into mass chaos.  Now, call me opportunistic, but wouldn't it
be great to get some Russians into hack/phreak?  (more like, call me crazy.) 
No, but seriously: their telephone network is not worth the wire that
connects it.  And since there's no shortage of genuine shit-disturbers in the
USSR, why not?  Oh well, 'twas an idea.....  This issue has turned out a lot
better than I thought it would.  For one thing, we now have a regular piracy
column written by Doc Scurlock: "Cracking Confidentials."  Check it out,
along with the article written by Antisocial on "Gas Tank Blues."  Maelmord
got really gung-ho and typed in the better part of the Material Safety Data
Sheets for Ammonium Nitrate and Anhydrous Hydrazine (wonderful stuff, eh?),
along with instructions on what to do with 'em.  As for Silicon Avalanche's
Pick Tutorial installment, that has been postponed until next month.

      I don't have that much to say this month, other than to say this: If you
write an article for us and you're willing to give us your name and address,
you'll get a FREE printed edition of the issue your article is in.  Thanks
in advance if you decide to.

      Until next time.. "Thanks for your support."                         ><
