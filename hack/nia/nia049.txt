This file is just an update on some things I found out after I wrote NIA044.TXT
HOW TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT ON A VMS BASED SYSTEM.  I'll be going over some
items that I have mentioned in NIA044.TXT, but you might be interested in
reading them again, for I now have included actual VAX Prompts and such, so
you will now have a better idea of what I am talking about.

$_Basic_Overview

When logging into a VMS based system, you will be greeted by the familiar
prompt, which tells you that you are in DCL (Digital Command Language):

Username:FIELD
Password:

Welcome to NETWORK INFORMATION ACCESS DATABASE ... VAX/VMS Version 5.3

    Last interactive login on Friday,  7-SEP-1990 20:07
$
$

The Password can be up to any character length that you want it to be set
at.  It is suggested that the password be under 32 characters.  Also the
password is NOT shown to you (Or in English, it is not echoed back to your
screen ).

Username:FIELD
Password:
User Authorization Failure

That means you screwed up, and for you to try again.

$_SHOW Command

I dialed into our system and pulled out the SHOW COMMAND section for you to
look at, this is exactly what is on a MICROVAX 3500 running VMS 5.3 (noticed
the new version since 4.7? hehehe), anyways, if you are dialed into any VAX,
you can type HELP and get a command, if you want all commands type HELP * and
get your buffer ready, BUT REMEMBER it only shows you the commands not ALL OF
THE COMMON QUALIFIERS.

$ HELP SHOW *

SHOW

  ACCOUNTING

      The SHOW ACCOUNTING command displays items for which  accounting  is

We will be viewing SHOW SYSTEM, SHOW USERS, STOP/ID=xxxxx commands today.
You will find the STOP/ID= command of most fun and interest in your crossing
of VAX's today.

As mentioned all the Show commands have been listed above for you and please
take your time, view them carefully, for when you are on a system, if you keep
typing HELP over and over again, that MAY give you away, I am not saying it
will, but, lets just say that someone that looks familiar w/ the system is less
a target then someone who keeps typing HELP every so often.  So if you must
make out a flow chart of what you wish to do or type out everything in advance
this can save you extreme amounts of time.

What has just been shown to you is all the USERS that are ONLINE at the
moment.  This must be done EVERY TIME YOU LOG ONTO A SYSTEM.  Now, re-read
everything in all caps there (EVERY TIME YOU LOG ONTO A SYSTEM), you MUST
type SHOW USERS, if you see a Username of MANAGER you might want to either
log off the system right away or just gamble that he is not really there.

But GOT, if Username is there, than that means he is online right? That is
what you said.  Correct that IS what I said but that is NOT what I meant.
When you type SHOW USERS that shows every terminal that has someone
successfully entered the system.  It does NOT MEAN THEY ARE THERE.  A neat and
sneaky security trick that SOME(note not ALL Managers)Managers pull, is that
they will log into the system and then freeze the terminal that they are on.
This gives the IMPRESSION that the MANAGER is logged on and when in all
actuallity she/he is NOT.  Now do NOT think that this means that every time
you log into a VAX and type SHOW USERS and see MANAGER, that you can go,
well GOT said its a fake, I did NOT say its a fake, I am saying that it
COULD BE A TRICK, and for all instances, the MANAGER could be a dummy
account, while the REAL MANAGER is under a different Username.  Just be
DOUBLE carefull when you see a MANAGER Username.  My own suggestion? Log Off
IMMEDIATELY.  Why take chances?

Show system, shows EVERY single thing out there.  Just to give you a quick
idea:

_VTA12: that is a Terminal
_NIA    that is a Node
FIELD   that is a Username in DCL
_TXA1:  that is a Device

The rest are all system files and such.

$_Stop Command, And Why It Can Be Fun...

The last new command I am going to teach you is the STOP command.  Listed

$ HELP STOP *

STOP

  Parameters


     process-name

      Specifies the name of the process to be deleted.  The  process  name
      can  have  from  1  to  15  alphanumeric  characters.  The specified
      process must have the same group number in its  user  identification
      code   (UIC)  as  the  current  process.   You  cannot  specify  the
      process-name for a process outside of your group.  To stop a process
      outside    of    your    group,   you   must   use   the   qualifier
      /IDENTIFICATION=pid.

      If you use  the  /IDENTIFICATION  qualifier,  the  process  name  is
      ignored.   If you include neither the process-name parameter nor the
      /IDENTIFICATION qualifier with the STOP command, the image executing
      in the current process is terminated.


STOP

  Command_Qualifiers


    /IDENTIFICATION
     /IDENTIFICATION=pid

     Specifies the process identification code (PID) that the  system  has
      assigned  to  the  process.   When you create a process with the RUN
      command, the RUN command displays the process identification code of
      the newly created process.

      You can omit any leading zeros in specifying the PID.



STOP

  Examples


      1.   $ RUN MYPROG
              .
              .
              .
           <CTRL/Y>
           Interrupt

           $ STOP

      The RUN command begins executing the  image  MYPROG.   Subsequently,
      CTRL/Y  interrupts  the execution.  The STOP command then terminates
      the image.

      2.   $ @TESTALL
              .
              .
              .
           <CTRL/Y>
           Interrupt

           $ STOP

      The  @  (Execute   Procedure)   command   executes   the   procedure
      TESTALL.COM.   CTRL/Y  interrupts  the  procedure.  The STOP command
      returns control to the DCL command interpreter.

      3.   $ RUN/PROCESS_NAME=LIBRA  LIBRA
           %RUN-S-PROC_ID, identification of created process is 0013340D
              .
              .
              .

           $ STOP LIBRA

      The RUN command creates a subprocess  named  LIBRA  to  execute  the
      image LIBRA.EXE.  Subsequently, the STOP command causes the image to
      exit and deletes the process.

      4.    $ ON ERROR THEN STOP
              .
              .
              .

      In a command procedure, the ON command establishes a default  action
      when any error occurs in the execution of a command or program.  The
      STOP command stops all  command  levels.   If  this  ON  command  is
      executed  in  a  command  procedure  which  in turn is executed from
      within another procedure, control  does  not  return  to  the  outer
      procedure, but to DCL command level 0.


STOP

  /CPU

      Stops the specified secondary processor  or  processors  in  a   VMS
      multiprocessing  system. The /CPU qualifier is required.

      Requires change mode to kernel (CMKRNL) privilege.


      Format:

        STOP/CPU  [cpu-id,...]

    /ALL       /OVERRIDE_CHECKS
    Examples


STOP

  /QUEUE

      The STOP/QUEUE command  causes  the  specified  execution  queue  to
      pause.  The /QUEUE qualifier is required.

      o  Cause executing jobs in the specified output queue to be  stopped
         (see /ABORT).

      o  Cause executing jobs in the specified batch queue to  be  stopped
         (see /ENTRY).

      o  Perform an orderly shutdown of the system job  queue  manager  on
         the node from which the command is issued (see /MANAGER).

      o  Cause the specified queue to stop after all executing  jobs  have
         completed processing (see /NEXT).

      o  Cause the executing jobs in the specified queue to be stopped and
         requeues it for later processing (see /REQUEUE).

      o  Abruptly stop the queue and return control  to  the  system  (see
         /RESET).

      Format:


        STOP/QUEUE  queue-name[:]

Now you must never start stopping Terminals (remember under Show System
_VTA1:???), if you type the following command:

STOP PROCESS/ID=8B6(return)

You will in effect shut down the terminal.  Thus, raising extreme panic
modes on the person that is using process id 8b6 (could actually be the
MANAGER under a false Username).

Where did I get 8B6??  I got 8B6 from SHOW SYSTEM, that, if you recall shows
every device, and if you look under the PROCESS ID column you will see where
I pulled 8B6 from.

When STOPping a process, you do NOT need to type in the entire PROCESS ID,
which is 000008B6, all you needed is the last bit of information, or where
it actually starts a number or letter.  You CAN type the entire line out if
you wish, but it saves time and increases speed to just type 8B6 instead of
000008B6.

Now why did I tell you about the STOP command? Because if you start stopping
PROCESS ID's you are going to raise some dangerous questions the next
morning or that night.  You can CRASH a system by stopping every device, and
in particular, you can shut down NODES as well as MODEMS, TERMINALS,
PRINTERS, etc...

$_Conclusions

Make a chart of what you are going to do, if you can create a text file and
print it out, or work it into a program anything, just have something in
front of you that you can read your commands off of.

The format for any VAX operations are (after you logged in):

SHOW USERS         : To see if a MANAGER User name is online
SHOW SYSTEM        : For those interested in other Devices such as modems

begin your process

If a MANAGER Username is online QUICKLY type LO(return) that is a shortened
way of typing LOG OUT.

The more you know the system, and the more comfortable you are, the less
likely you are to make mistakes, and remember the Golden Rules of Hacking as
laid down in Phrack (no I'm not going to reprint them, get the issue
yourself), follow them.
