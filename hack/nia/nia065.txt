Protecting Your PBX From Illegal Access
=======================================

As an owner of a private branch exchange (or PBX) you've invested
quite a lot of money into a remarkable piece of equipment that greatly
enhances your company's communications capabilities. A so-called smart
device, this sophisticated switch usually has a number of useful
device, this sophisticated switch usually has a number of useful
features such as remote access and voice store-and-forward systems, or
voice mail.

     The problem is, criminals are finding it easier than ever to
access these helpful features, blocking out legitimate users.  This is
mainly because many end-users are not taking advantage of new
protective technologies that are now available.

   You may be a victim of this industry-wide problem and not even
know it. Last year, a Midwestern manufacturer lost $25,000 when
someone accessed its PBX for a short time to make unauthorized long
distance calls.

One favorite PBX pathway to free long distance calls is the      
remote access unit, which allows callers to access the switch from a
phone outside the company and obtain a dial tone.

     The abuse is hitting end-users at all levels. Over a two- month
period in 1988, employees at a large city agency rigged a phone system
in a scam that cost taxpayers over $700,000 for unauthorized phone
calls. Workers tampered with the organization's PBX to allow callers
from public payphones to dial a special access number that gave them
an outside line to anywhere in the world.

    In another case, intruders left instructions on computer bulletin
board systems detailing how to access conference bridges, call
diverters and remote access units.

     Abusers can include current and former employees, summer interns
and technicians as well as hackers, street hustlers and other thieves
of telecommunications services.  And unfortunately, many companies
simply forget to take out the easy-to-break authorization test codes
that are installed before a PBX is placed in service.


                      Establish Strict Defenses
                      =========================

1.   Assign authorization codes randomly on a need-to-have basis,
     and limit the number of calls using these codes. Never match
     codes with company telephone, station or badge numbers.

2.   Instruct employees to safeguard their authorization codes,
     which should be assigned individually, not printed in
     billing records. And the codes should be changed frequently,
     and canceled when employees depart.

3.   Remote access trunks should be limited to domestic calling   
     and shut down when not in use.

4.   Use the time-of-day PBX option.

5.   Use a system-wide barrier code, followed by an authorization
     code with the most digits your PBX can handle.

6.   Use a nonpublished number for remote access lines.

7.   Use a delayed electronic call response (the same as letting
     your phone ring four or five times before answering).

8.   Try hacking your own system to find weaknesses, then correct
     them.


               Implementing Effective Controls
               ===============================

1.   Know the safeguards on your PBX.

2.   Develop an action plan that provides adequate staffing to
     direct specific defensive procedures.

3.   Monitor billing, call details and traffic for unusual
     patterns and busy lines during off-peak hours, such as late
     at night.

4.   Inform PBX console attendants, night security officers and
     remote access users of the need to secure equipment and what
     to do if they suspect an intrusion.

5.   Ask your PBX vendor/supplier what inherent defenses could be
     used to make your PBX more difficult to penetrate.

6.   Monitor valid and invalid call attempts as often as
     possible.

7.   Look for attempted calls of short duration that usually
     indicate hacking activity.

8.   Know who is on the other end of the line before giving out
     any information.

9.   Learn whom to contact at your local and long distance
     service providers when you have a security problem.
