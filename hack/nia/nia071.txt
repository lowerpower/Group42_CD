[Editoral Info: Mr. Kimberlin has been a broadcasting engineer since 1957, with
                added time at AT&T in international communications, later
                at ITT preforming the same work with international cables and
                satellites.  Then manufacturers of communications equipmnet
                as an export marketer to the government PTT's of 70 countries
                on five continents.]

     It seems many participants thought such a transmission circuit is
a rather special form of transmission medium; one infrequently used
and perhaps of exceedingly high cost.  What follows is an attempt to
describe what is actually a rather common and age-old technique in a
way that might help readers know how to use it for their own benefit.

     Most people involved with telephony have only been exposed to
local use, adn even local subscriber line physical plant, where a
single pair of wires is used for a dial subscriber line for one over-
riding reason: The cost of providing service to the majority of users,
people who simply want dial voice-grade telephone service.

     Were the local telephone exchanges to use a "four-wire line" to
each and every subscriber, we could have a far more idealized Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN - the proper CCITT name). We in the
US often mistitle the PSTN as "DDD," which actually is the Bell
acronym for Direct Distance Dialing (long-distance subscriber dialing,
called STD in the UK, or a close equivalent in other nations).

Transmission losses could have historically been much less, as there
would be no echoes to combat.  We would transmit in one direction on
one pair and transmit in the other direction on the other, without
interaction between the two directions.  However, to provide such a
plant would require double the literally millions of tones of copper
wire that have been installed worldwide.  The economic cost factors
are obvious. Paying for the local cable plant has been a major cost
factor for public telephone networks worldwide. (Other alternatives
such as fiber and coaxial cable used by cable TV companies are making
some change, but the millions of tons of copper are already there ...
and ISDN is planned in a way to try to continue to use that imbedded
investment.

     So, a local telephone plant uses only one pair per subscriber.
In engineering terms, it is far from a perfect transmission line.  The
main reason is that no transmission line operates at its normal
electrical "impedance" until it is a significant portion of an
electrical wavelength of the signal it carries.  Studying a beginning
physics book will show that one wavelength at 3000 Hertz in a perfect
line is 61 miles, and at 300 Hertz, it would be 610 miles! (Another
factor called the "propagation velocity" even stretches this _much_
more in practical wire.)  Obviously, to have even reasonably
well-matched wire would not be reasonable, and it wasn't at all
economical in the developmental era of the PSTN.  So, this network
evolved assuming some very large tradeoffs were needed.

     An electrical transmission line has one interesting
characteristic just opposite from water pipes or acoustical guides
(hollow tubes).  Instead of an open distant end letting all the energy
spill out, an open-ended electrical line _reflects_ all its received
power back toward the source.  A shorted line absorbs all the energy
(as you find out when you short a power line and blow the fuse!).
What this characteristic means to telephone transmission is that with
lines as short as they must be in local plant, echoes are reflected
back toward the speaker, subject only to the losses they incur
rattling back and forth.  They really are pretty high, but we don't
notice them.  The reason: Echoes that return to our ear in less than
about 10-15 thousandths of a second are heard by us a part of the
outbound signal ... we just don't hear them. Local connections are
short enough that for general telephony, echoes can be largely
discounted, even thought they are there.

     Very early in the development of longer transmission paths, it
was learned that transmission losses mount rapidly when one really
does have miles and miles of wire to talk on. In intercity
transmission lines, use of electronics to amplify the signal as
intervals was seen to be mandatory to achieve commercially successful
"long lines."  Thus, as soon as the three-electrode vacuum tube was
available, the telephone industry had a very real interest in it, and
pressed to realize its use as soon as possible.  (In fact, a Bell Labs
worker contributed "negative feedback" to the early vacuum-tube
circuitry, making the "tube" a controllable, useful technology instead
of a physics lab curio.)

     But, the vacuum tube (as its descendant, the transistor) has one
limitation.  It can pass a signal in only one direction, a
characteristic that happens to match that idealized "four-wire"
transmission line.  So, "long lines" very early on (in the 1910-15
time frame) all became "four-wire lines."

    They did, however, have to interface to the echo-prone and less
controllable local "two-wire" (single pair) telephone networks.  The
method devised was the "hybrid," in telephony mostly an arrangement of
trans- formers that had three windings, one for the local two-wire
side and one each for the sending and receiving "long lines."  Now,
echoes were a real problem.  Not only would echoes from the local
two-wire line take long enough to return to the distant city to be
heard, but impedance mismatching of the two-wire local line to the
transformer could cause received distant signals to reflect right in
the transformer back down the transmitting channel as well. "Echo
control" became a major topic in handling "long lines." (The trick is
to add a fourth winding set to the transformer with an "artificial
line" that is adjusted to create the match. In telephony, its name is
a "balancing network."

     All this sort of work was at first (and for decades) the work of
the "long lines" people.  Very little of it was in the hands of the
local people.  The "long lines" people were AC and electronics people,
while the local people were DC and electrical people.  The oeprational
reasons for having a "Long Lines Department" are obvious in this
context.

     As multichannel "carrier systems" evolved (and early, too,
beginning around 1915 between Toledo, Ohio and South Bend, Indiana in
the US), their intrinsic electronic transmission using vacuum tubes
made a "four-wire" (of virtual wires, certainly) a commonplace in
intercity transmission.  And every "carrier system" since the
beginning has been made of "four-wire" paths ... set up in pairs of
channels, one for each direction of transmission, needing that
"hybrid" function at each end to connect to the local plant.

     In intercity (and more so international) carrier systems, a
"line" transiting a junction point can be (and is) connected on a
"four-wire" basis, either _through_ a "four wire switching machine"
for PSTN temporary connections, or hard-wired _around_ the switching
machine if the use is a semi-permanent "special services" circuit,
like a dedicated data line or indeed, a permanent speech circuit, as
is CNN's "four-wire line," our subject here.  At the end points, one
local pair is used for each direction of transmission ... at a price
reflective of using twice the local plant. Local wire pairs ...
"loops" ... for "special services" are expensive to rent. After all,
they are no longer available for the local telco to derive PSTN
revenue on.  If reaching the "long lines" point of presence (now
called a "POP" in American jargon) requires use of local wire
(nowadays local carrier channels) across a city, these are no longer
available for "trunk" use between local PSTN exchanges, considerable
revnue potential is lost, and is going to be paid for.  Thus, many
speech-only "private circuits" do have a hybrid in the "POP" and use
only one local pair anyway ... but are STILL "four wire channels"
between cities.

    The British have some excellent descriptive terminology we
Americans never developed.  They speak of transmission circuits as
"two wire presented" or "four wire presented" to the end user.  These
terms, of course recognize that long circuits are all "four wire,"
regardless of how they are 'presented" to the end user.

   What are the advantages of "four wire presentation?" Avoidance of
the electrical echo bugaboo. And, part of the "control" of echoes in
"two-wire presentations" is to deliberately insert transmission loss
to make the echoes a bit lower, so "four wire presented" channels can
have less loss and sound louder ... and deliver the received signal
higher above the noise ... making the signal sound "cleaner."  This of
course is why high-quality dedicated data circuits are four-wire
presented ... to give the modem signals the most advantage possible.

     Hopefully, if you have persisted through this longish
explanation, you now know that the "four wire line" is indeed not rare
at all. Rather, it is the norm between cities, and especially between
nations.  You know it isn't new.  It's just that most people have
never seen one.  Improvements in the local plant (including widespread
deployment of digital carrier, the "T" carrier so often spoken of
today) have made extension of the "four-wire line" right into your
local exchange a reality in most places, so even your PSTN phone
sounds much louder and cleaner than it did twenty years ago.  That's
what solid-state electronics coupled to digital transmission did for
us all.

     Those who really _needed_ the advantages of "four-wire" have used
it for a long time.  Major examples were the FAA's network of
dedicated lines that had to be interconnected at random (reflected in
Bell parlance as the "FAA 300-type switching system), and the US
military's AUTOVON network.  While AUTOVON was based on four-wire
switching machines throughout right to four-wire telephone sets,
economics even there forced the allowance of two-wire user lines and
telephones for voice-only stations, and many AUTOVON lines wound up
being four-wire.  But, AUTOVON also has many "four-wire" user stations
where dedicated-line type "full-duplex' data modems can be used.

  For those who really want to learn more, I recommend the following books:


        1.) "Basic Carrier Telephony" by David Talley, a real chestnut
        of telephone transmission for the non-technical reader who is
        weak on physics.  Originally published by Hayden Book Company
        as their stock number 5749 (Library of Congress catalog number
        60-10470 in its second edition, I understand that Wiley in
        New York has republished it and finds several Telcos use it for
        textbook for technicians.

        2.) "Understanding Communications Systems," by Don L. Cannon and
        Gerald Luecke, originally published and sold by Radio Shack
        stores as part number 62-2018 (ISBN 0-89512-035-6) for $2.95,
        this book has been republished by Howard Sams at Indianapolis
        for about six times the price in hardback.  It uses far less
        classic "telephonese" but has excellent ways of showing how
        analog and digital transmission are far more related than most
        non-technical people can understand.

     I recommend both of these books to the harried educators on here
who are frustrated in finding short texts for introductory curricula.

 1.   Warning

 BETWEEN 8.00 am and 10.00 am every Tuesday, network development and  service
 work is  carried  out  on  JANET.  This means that if you make a call during
 these hours there is an increased danger of the system going down which  may
 result in loss of data.

 _________________
 2.   Introduction

 The Gateway is a two-way link between the U.K.  Academic Network (JANET) and
 PSS.  At present there are two  Gateways  between  JANET  and  PSS,  one  at
 Rutherford and another at ULCC in <garbled>.
 The Gateway consists of a computer which holds a communications program  and
 sits between  two  networks  (JANET  and PSS in this case).  This allows the
 user to bridge the gap between the networks and access target  computers  on
 the other  network.   It  is important to realise that there are two ways of
 communicating with the Gateway - you can make calls TO the Gateway  computer
 to access  its limited user facilities or you can make calls THROUGH it to a
 target computer on the other network.

 The Gateway operates as a Transport Level Gateway  in  accordance  with  the
 'Yellow Book'  Transport  Service.   However the present implementation does
 not have a full Transport Service and therefore, there are some  limitations
 in the service provided.  For X29 which is incompatible with the Yellow Book
 Transport Service,  special  facilities  are  provided for the input of user
 identification and addresses.

 The Gateway is a protocol transparent link.  This  means  that  the  Gateway
 cannot be  used  for  protocol conversion;  to do this a third party machine
 must be used.

 4.   Permission to Use the Gateway

 _____________________________________
 4.1  Authentication and Authorisation

 No unauthenticated use of the Gateway from JANET is  allowed  regardless  of
 whether charges  are  incurred  at the Gateway or not.  Therefore to use the
 Gateway you have to  obtain  authentication  (a  userid  and  password)  and
 authorisation (a  call  allocation)  from the JANET Network Executive.  This
 consists of:

      a. USERID
      b. PASSWORD
      c. USAGE ALLOCATION

 Note that the authorisation for PSS and IPSS is managed separately, although
 a single USERID may have authoristation for both.

 There is no restriction on access from PSS.

 ____________________________
 4.2  Charging and Accounting

 There are 4 separate charging rates, which are:

      PSS full rate:      PSS (FULL)
      PSS discount rate:  PSS (DISC)
      TLXN:               Telex access via Interstream 1.
      IPSS full rate:     IPSS (FULL)

 Note that the TELEX access is expensive, as the cost  includes  the  use  of
 PSS, Interstream  1  and  TELEX.   Anyone  who is interested in TELEX access
 should first discuss it with the Network Executive.

 To be able to make chargeable calls you must request a  call  allocation  to
 cover   the  charging  rates  you  want  to  use  when  you  ask  for   your
 authentication.  For calls that are free e.g.  calls within JANET or  normal
 charge calls from PSS you do not need an allocation.

 The PSS discount rate applies from 1800 to 0800 each night and  all  day  on
 Sundays, Christmas Day and New Year's Day.  The PSS full rate applies at ALL
 OTHER times.   The  IPSS  full  rate  applies at ALL times for international
 calls.  For details of the international rates to various countries  consult
 Network User Note 2.

 If your allocation runs out during an active call, then that  call  will  be
 cleared and all further calls at that rate will be refused.

 5.   How to Make Terminal Calls to the Gateway

 It is possible to make calls to the Gateway to access the HELP  and  ACCOUNT
 facilities.

 The HELP facility contains the whole of this user guide in its most uptodate
 form.  The facility allows random scans of the  document  and  searches  for
 text within the document.

 The Account facility allows the user to inspect the state of his account and
 to change the password for that account.

 6.   How to Make Terminal Calls Through the Gateway

 The method used to make a call through the Gateway depends on  the  type  of
 PAD being  used.   If  your PAD supports TS29 the procedure is simplified as
 this protocol allows you to make calls that can cross several  networks  via
 several Gateways.   If  your  PAD  supports  X29  then  if you wish to cross
 several Gateways you normally have to stop at each one before you  can  pass
 through it.  However a special facility is provided using the Call User Data
 Field to allow X29 calls non-stop through the JANET PSS Gateway.

 Whichever protocol your PAD supports, you must have some way of generating a
 Transport Service Called Address for onward routing by the Gateway.

 _________________________________________
 6.1  The Transport Service Called Address

 To make a call  through  the  Gateway  you  have  to  supply  the  following
 information in  the form of a Transport Service Called Address to your local
 PAD.

      a. Netname:         the name of the network you are calling.
      b. Authentication:  consisting of Userid and Password in that order.
                          This can be omitted for free calls.
      c. Host address:    the network address of the remote host.

 The format of the Transport Service Called Address is as follows:

      <Netname>(<Authentication>).<Host Address>

 These are explained below.

 _______
 Netname

 This is one of the following:

      JANET to connect to JANET
      PSS   to connect to PSS
      J     an alias for JANET.


 How to Use the U.K. Academic Network - Packet SwitchStream (PSS) Gateway


 ______________
 Authentication

 This consists of 3 fields which must be entered in the order shown.

      a. user id,
      b. password,
      c. A request for the call to be reverse charged.

 The last field is optional.

                                           ____
 Note that the whole authentication string must be enclosed  in  parentheses.

 _______
 Example

      (FRED,XYZ,R)  Requests a reverse charge call
      (FRED,XYZ)    Requests a chargeable call.

 ____________
 Host Address

 This is the numeric address of the machine being called.   However  to  make
 things easier  the  numeric  address  can  be  replaced with an alphanumeric
 mnemonic if one has been set up on the Gateway.

 _______
 Example

      use RLGB instead of 000000002105 to call the Rutherford GEC 'B' machine
      use SALF instead of 234261643210 to call Salford on PSS.

 For a list of these mnemonics see JANET User Notes 5 and 6.

 Host addresses can be complex and it is possible to specify several Gateways
 that you must pass through to  reach  a  specific  remote  host  and/or  the
 service required.   Note  that  a  point  (.)   must be used to separate the
 numeric addresses or mnemonics from the service names.

 _______
 Example

      RLPA     - this calls the Rutherford ICF Prime on Janet.
      RLPA.FTP - this calls FTP on the Rutherford ICF Prime on Janet.

 To connect to some machines, an X25 sub-address is required, which  consists
 of a  number  of  extra digits added on to the machine address.  This can be
 easily entered on the Gateway by using the delimiter '-' at the end  of  the
 mnemonic address  and  then  typing  the  sub-address.  When the mnemonic is
 translated the delimiter is ignored and the whole address is converted  into
 a continuous string.

 _______
 Example


 Janet-69 is translated to 23422351919169

 How to Use the U.K. Academic Network - Packet SwitchStream (PSS) Gateway


 _____________________________________
 6.2  Making Calls Using TS29 Protocol

 TS29 is the ideal protocol to use through the Gateway, since there should be
 no problem entering the Transport Service Called  Address.   However,  first
 make sure  that  the  machine you are calling will support TS29.  When using
 this protocol for network terminal calls the service name of the TS29 server
 should be entered explicitly.

 _____________________
 6.3  The Full Address

 Combining all these factors a full address might look like this.

      J(FRED,XYZ).RLGB.TS29

 ____________________________________
 6.4  Making Calls Using X29 Protocol

 X29 is incompatible with the 'Yellow Book' Transport Service and  some  PADS
 are unable to generate the Transport Service Called Address.  When making an
 X29 call,  the  onward Called Address may be entered into the Call User Data
 Field of the Call.  Some PADs, e.g.  the British Telecom PAD are  unable  to
 generate a  Call  User Data Field longer than 12 characters and so there may
 not be enough space to hold all the information required.  In this  case,  a
 Call must  be  established  only  as far as the Gateway, and a dialogue held
 with the Gateway to establish the next part of the connection.

 If your PAD can generate a Call User Data Field, then the first character of
 the text is treated as a delimiter, and should be entered as  the  character
 '@' followed by the onward Called address.

 _______
 Example

 On a CAMTEC PAD one might enter:-

      CALL 00004000004096 D=@(FRED,XYZ).SOMEWHERE

 t
 make a call through the London Gateway to SOMEWHERE on PSS.

 ________________________________________
 Overcoming Call User Data Field Problems

 With X29 PADs the onward Called Address can be supplied interactively at the
 Gateway without having to set up a Call User Data field.   To  do  this  the
 Gateway must  be  called  with  the  correct X25 sub-address.  This involves
 adding an extra 2 digits onto the normal 12 digit address  of  the  Gateway.
 The sub-address  for  JANET  is  69  and  96 for PSS.  The Gateway will then
 prompt for the onward Called Address.

 The procedure  is  as  follows:   Call  the  Gateway   using   the   correct
 sub-address:

      23422351919169    to call JANET from PSS via the RAL Gateway
      00000000004096    (or the mnemonic RL.PSS) to call PSS from JANET
                        via the RAL Gateway.

      23421920010069    to call JANET from PSS via the London Gateway
      00004000004096    (or the mnemonic LON.PSS) to call PSS from
                        JANET via the London Gateway.


 How to Use the U.K. Academic Network - Packet SwitchStream (PSS) Gateway


 The response from the Gateway will be the following message:

      Please enter your authorisation and address required in form:
      (user,password).address
      >

 Reply with the appropriate response.

 _______
 Example

      (FRED,XYZ).SOMEWHERE

 As the X29 protocol is being used there is no need to  include  the  service
 name X29.

 Authentication is not required for incoming calls to JANET.   In  this  case
 the string  (FRED,XYZ)  can be omitted, note however that the address should
 still be preceded with a point.

 _______
 Example

      .RLGB

 There is a timeout of between 3 and 4 minutes for this response after  which
 the call  will  be  cleared,  however  there  is  no  limit to the number of
 attempts which can made within this time limit.   If  the  authorisation  or
 adress entered is invalid the Gateway will request it again.  To abandon the
 attempt clear  the call from the PAD.  For further details of how to do this
 see Network User Note 11.

 You will find that on some PADs a 'call connected' message  will  appear  on
 the terminal  as  soon  as the call has been connected to the Gateway.  This
 does not mean that you have made contact  with  your  ultimate  destination.
 When you  have  contacted  the  remote  host  the  Gateway will show a 'Call
 connected to remote address' message.

 _____________________________________________
 8.   Facilities Available Through the Gateway

 ___________________________
 8.1  Demonstration Facility

 There is an account available which has a  small  allocation  available  for
 users to try out the Gateway.  The password will be supplied on request from
 the Network  Executive.   Note  that excessive use of this account will soon
 exhaust its allocation and deprive others of its use.

 ___________________________________________________
 8.2  Address Mnemonics of Remote Hosts on Networks
      ________________________
      Connected to the Gateway

 Many network addresses consist  of  12  or  even  14  digits  which  may  be
rm   33; Next>

 difficult to remember and awkward to enter.  To make life easier the Gateway
 has a  table  which  consists  of a number of mnemonics and their respective
 network addresses.  When these mnemonics are typed within a call through the
 Gateway the mnemonic is translated into the appropriate network address.

 Therefore if you have a frequently used network address which is not in  the
 table, please  contact  the  Network  Executive with a request to insert the
 address along  with  an  appropriate  mnemonic.   Equally  if  you  know  of
 mnemonics which are no longer useable contact the Network Executive.

 It is hoped that the Gateway will support the  Network  Registration  Scheme
 (NRS) in the near future.

 JANET User Notes 5 and 6 include mnemonics for a number of  remote  machines
 and networks on both PSS and JANET.


 How to Use the U.K. Academic Network - Packet SwitchStream (PSS) Gateway


 _______________________________
 9.  Facilities Available on PSS

 ________________
 9.1  Fast Select

 This allows calls to have up to 128 bytes in the Call User Data field.   You
 can use this to expand address information available for the next hop of the
 call.  As  a  PSS  user  we  have  subscribed to this facility;  however you
 should note that some remote Hosts on PSS and IPSS cannot accept Fast Select
 calls.  If a Fast Select call is made to an address which does not subscribe
 to the Fast Select facility the call will fail with clearing  code  Hex'29'.

 When a mnemonic is used, the Gateway  will  know  whether  the  address  can
 support Fast Select or not, and will make the correct call automatically.

 If the full numeric address is used, then the Gateway has to be told not  to
 use Fast  Select.  This can be done by preceding the address with the string
 'NFS-'.  In fact the NFS is a mnemonic which translates  to  a  null  string
 with the  No  Fast  Select attribute and the minus is just a delimiter which
 will be ignored.

 For example, calling TELENET

       PSS(FRED,XYZ).NFS-311012345678

 ____________________________
 9.2  Reverse Charge Facility

 If this facility is used the remote Host will accept all the  call  charges,
 therefore your  allocation  on  the Janet Gateway will not be debited.  Note
 that there are not many remote Hosts which will accept  'reverse  charging'.

 Unfortunately the only way to find out if a remote Host will accept  reverse
 charging is  to  experiment.   Do this by appending 'R' to the authorisation
 field, for example

      (FRED,XYZ,R)

 If this does not work, it could be because the remote host will only  accept
 calls from 'known' network addresses and the JANET addresses are 'unknown'

 ___________________
 9.3  Access to IPSS

 It is possible to access  IPSS,  the  International  Packet  Switch  Stream,
 through PSS.   This is done by entering the IPSS address in place of the PSS
 address.  IPSS calls are accounted separately from PSS so you will  have  to
 make a  specific  request  for  an  IPSS allocation before you make calls on
 IPSS.

 ___________________________________________________
 9.4  Calls to Other, Non-Transport Service Networks

 Some networks (for example, TYMNET) require a Call User Data  Field  with  a
 different format from the one normally generated by the Gateway.  A facility
 has been  provided  to enable an arbitrary string to be included in the Call
 User Data Field.  This is  done  by  terminating  the  numeric  address  (or
 mnemonic)   with  the  delimiter  '*D'  followed  by  the  required  string.
 Everything following the '*D' is then copied into the Call User Data  Field.

 How to Use the U.K. Academic Network - Packet SwitchStream (PSS) Gateway


 _______
 Example

      PSS(FRED,XYZ).NFS-31060000*DZRRT;IPSSLON

 This would call a (fictitious) address on TYMMNET.

 Finally some machines do not expect to receive any user data at all, so  you
 will need to enter '*D' on its own for these.

 _______
 Example

      PSS(FRED,XYZ).YONDER*D

 ___________________________
 9.5  Adjusting Packet Sizes

 The Gateway normally tries to establish its calls with a packet size of  256
 bytes, even  if  the incoming call had only 128 byte packets.  This normally
 does not cause problems, but there may be difficulties  with  some  systems.
 If you  find  your  call  being  cleared  even  though all the addressing is
 correct, or if it fails as soon as data starts to flow, try calling with the
 additional data, '*P7W2', to force a packet size of 128 bytes.

 _______
 Example

      PSS(FRED,XYZ).OVERTHERE*P7W2

 If you also need to use the *D parameter that must follow the *P/W paramter.

 _______
 Example

      PSS(FRED,XYZ).HERE*P7W2*DTOYOU

 ___________________________________________________
 10.  Protocols Available if Supported by Both Local
      ________________________
      and Remote Host Machines

 Other sorts of calls, besides terminal calls, may be  possible  through  the
 Gateway.  In  these  cases  Transport  Service  is required.  The mechanisms
 required for insertion of authorisation information vary  from  computer  to
 computer, and  therefore  your  local  support staff should be consulted for
 information in this area.

 Care needs to be exercised here, especially when replying to MAIL  from  PSS
 without considering  how  the  authorisation  will be managed.  Problems can
 also occur with FTP, which will continue to retry a call until it receives a
 fatal error, causing unnecessary network traffic.

 _____________________________________________________
 10.1 Network Independent File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

 This allows files from one computer's file store to  be  sent  to  the  file
 store of  another  computer.   Although  the  two  computers  may  have very
 different ways of working internally, FTP will overcome  these  difficulties
 and arrange for the transfer of the file without the user being aware of the
 special procedures that are being carried out.


 How to Use the U.K. Academic Network - Packet SwitchStream (PSS) Gateway


 ______________________
 10.2 JNT MAIL Protocol

 This allows MAIL messages to be sent from one user  to  another  user.   The
 users may  be  using  the same machine or may be using machines on different
 networks.  In both cases the user types his message into the  machine  being
 used and  the MAIL program then adds a header to the message, so that it can
 be transmitted to the remote Host by FTP.  The received message is stored on
 the remote Host and made available to the addressee.

 __________________________________________________
 10.3 Job Transfer and Manipulation Protocol (JTMP)

 This protocol lets you:

      transfer files for storage or execution
      make status enquiries and get reports on these files.
      modify the progress of the above.

 This protocol requires standard FTP to carry out the transfers.

 ____________________________
 11.  Restrictions and Errors

 _________________
 11.1 Restrictions

 Due to the present lack of a full Transport  Service  in  the  gateway,  the
 ADDRESS, DISCONNECT  and  RESET primitives are not fully supported.  However
 this should not present  serious  problems,  since  the  ADDRESS  and  RESET
 primitives are  not widely used, and the DISCONNECT primitive can be carried
 in a Clear Request packet.

 The gateway does however support continuation of Transport  Service  Connect
 messages into  the  first  data  packet.   This  is particularly useful when
 attempting file transfers for which the  12-byte  CUDF  limitation  pertains
 (i.e.  NSF- calls).

 ___________
 11.2 Errors

 When a call fails, there is an error code associated with the failure  which
 will normally be displayed on your PAD.  A list of the most common codes and
 their meanings is given in Network User Note 15.

Introduction

This is an address list of all the mnemonics that can  be  accessed  via  the
JANET Packet SwitchStream Gateway.

The list is sorted in numerical order using the machine address.   The  first
three digits  of the address are a code which indicates the country where the
machine is situated.  Headings appear throughout the list giving the  country
name followed by the machines available there.


The list is divided into 3 columns which show:

a. The numeric address (DTE address)

b. A mnemonic for the address

c. A description of where the machine is located.

7.0  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICY AND THE CRITERIA

Section 1 presents fundamental computer security requirements and Section 5
presents the control objectives for Trusted Computer Systems.  They are
general requirements, useful and necessary, for the development of all secure
systems.  However, when designing systems that will be used to process
classified or other sensitive information, functional requirements for meeting
the Control Objectives become more specific.  There is a large body of policy
laid down in the form of Regulations, Directives, Presidential Executive
Orders, and OMB Circulars that form the basis of the procedures for the
handling and processing of Federal information in general and classified
information specifically.  This section presents pertinent excerpts from these
policy statements and discusses their relationship to the Control Objectives.


7.1  Established Federal Policies

A significant number of computer security policies and associated requirements
have been promulgated by Federal government elements.  The interested reader
is referred to reference [32] which analyzes the need for trusted systems in
the civilian agencies of the Federal government, as well as in state and local
governments and in the private sector.  This reference also details a number
of relevant Federal statutes, policies and requirements not treated further
below.

Security guidance for Federal automated information systems is provided by the
Office of Management and Budget.  Two specifically applicable Circulars have
been issued.  OMB Circular No.  A-71, Transmittal Memorandum No.  1, "Security
of Federal Automated Information Systems,"[26] directs each executive agency
to establish and maintain a computer security program.  It makes the head of
each executive branch, department and agency responsible "for assuring an
adequate level of security for all agency data whether processed in-house or
commercially.  This includes responsibility for the establishment of physical,
administrative and technical safeguards required to adequately protect
personal, proprietary or other sensitive data not subject to national security
regulations, as well as national security data."[26, para. 4 p. 2]

OMB Circular No.  A-123, "Internal Control Systems,"[27] issued to help
eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse in government programs requires: (a) agency
heads to issue internal control directives and assign responsibility, (b)
managers to review programs for vulnerability, and (c) managers to perform
periodic reviews to evaluate strengths and update controls.  Soon after
promulgation of OMB Circular A-123, the relationship of its internal control
requirements to building secure computer systems was recognized.[4] While not
stipulating computer controls specifically, the definition of Internal
Controls in A-123 makes it clear that computer systems are to be included:

     "Internal Controls - The plan of organization and all of the methods and
      measures adopted within an agency to safeguard its resources, assure the
      accuracy and reliability of its information, assure adherence to
      applicable laws, regulations and policies, and promote operational
      economy and efficiency."[27, sec. 4.C]

The matter of classified national security information processed by ADP
systems was one of the first areas given serious and extensive concern in
computer security.  The computer security policy documents promulgated as a
result contain generally more specific and structured requirements than most,
keyed in turn to an authoritative basis that itself provides a rather clearly
articulated and structured information security policy.  This basis, Executive
Order 12356, "National Security Information," sets forth requirements for the
classification, declassification and safeguarding of "national security
information" per se.[14]

7.2  DoD Policies

Within the Department of Defense, these broad requirements are implemented and
further specified primarily through two vehicles: 1) DoD Regulation 5200.1-R
[7], which applies to all components of the DoD as such, and 2) DoD 5220.22-M,
"Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information" [11],
which applies to contractors included within the Defense Industrial Security
Program.  Note that the latter transcends DoD as such, since it applies not
only to any contractors handling classified information for any DoD component,
but also to the contractors of eighteen other Federal organizations for whom
the Secretary of Defense is authorized to act in rendering industrial security
services.*

           Services Department, Labor Department, Environmental
           Protection Agency, Justice Department, U.S. Arms Control and
           Disarmament Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency,
           Federal Reserve System, and U.S. General Accounting Office.
           ____________________________________________________________


For ADP systems, these information security requirements are further amplified
and specified in: 1) DoD Directive 5200.28 [8] and DoD Manual 5200.28-M [9],
for DoD components; and 2) Section XIII of DoD 5220.22-M [11] for contractors.
DoD Directive 5200.28, "Security Requirements for Automatic Data Processing
(ADP) Systems," stipulates: "Classified material contained in an ADP system
shall be safeguarded by the continuous employment of protective features in
the system's hardware and software design and configuration .  .  .  ."[8,
sec.  IV] Furthermore, it is required that ADP systems that "process, store,
or use classified data and produce classified information will, with
reasonable dependability, prevent:

     a.  Deliberate or inadvertent access to classified material by
         unauthorized persons, and

     b.  Unauthorized manipulation of the computer and its associated
         peripheral devices."[8, sec. I B.3]

Requirements equivalent to these appear within DoD 5200.28-M [9] and in DoD
5220.22-M [11].

>From requirements imposed by these regulations, directives and circulars, the
three components of the Security Policy Control Objective, i.e., Mandatory and
Discretionary Security and Marking, as well as the Accountability and
Assurance Control Objectives, can be functionally defined for DoD
applications.  The following discussion provides further specificity in Policy
for these Control Objectives.

7.3  Criteria Control Objective for Security Policy

     7.3.1  Marking

          The control objective for marking is: "Systems that are designed
          to enforce a mandatory security policy must store and preserve the
          integrity of classification or other sensitivity labels for all
          information.  Labels exported from the system must be accurate
          representations of the corresonding internal sensitivity labels
          being exported."

          DoD 5220.22-M, "Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding
          Classified Information," explains in paragraph 11 the reasons for
          marking information:

               "Designation by physical marking, notation or other means
               serves to inform and to warn the holder about the
               classification designation of the information which requires
               protection in the interest of national security.  The degree
               of protection against unauthorized disclosure which will be
               required for a particular level of classification is directly
               commensurate with the marking designation which is assigned
               to the material."[11]

          Marking requirements are given in a number of policy statements.

          Executive Order 12356 (Sections 1.5.a and 1.5.a.1) requires that
          classification markings "shall be shown on the face of all
          classified documents, or clearly associated with other forms of
          classified information in a manner appropriate to the medium
          involved."[14]

          DoD Regulation 5200.1-R (Section 1-500) requires that: ".  .  .
          information or material that requires protection against
          unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security shall
          be classified in one of three designations, namely: 'Top Secret,'
          'Secret' or 'Confidential.'"[7] (By extension, for use in computer
          processing, the unofficial designation "Unclassified" is used to
          indicate information that does not fall under one of the other
          three designations of classified information.)

          DoD Regulation 5200.1-R (Section 4-304b) requires that: "ADP
          systems and word processing systems employing such media shall
          provide for internal classification marking to assure that
          classified information contained therein that is reproduced or
          generated, will bear applicable classification and associated
          markings." (This regulation provides for the exemption of certain
          existing systems where "internal classification and applicable
          associated markings cannot be implemented without extensive system
          modifications."[7]  However, it is clear that future DoD ADP
          systems must be able to provide applicable and accurate labels for
          classified and other sensitive information.)

          DoD Manual 5200.28-M (Section IV, 4-305d) requires the following:
          "Security Labels - All classified material accessible by or within
          the ADP system shall be identified as to its security
          classification and access or dissemination limitations, and all
          output of the ADP system shall be appropriately marked."[9]

     7.3.2  Mandatory Security

          The control objective for mandatory security is: "Security
          policies defined for systems that are used to process classified
          or other specifically categorized sensitive information must
          include provisions for the enforcement of mandatory access control
          rules.  That is, they must include a set of rules for controlling
          access based directly on a comparison of the individual's
          clearance or authorization for the information and the
          classification or sensitivity designation of the information being
          sought, and indirectly on considerations of physical and other
          environmental factors of control.  The mandatory access control
          rules must accurately reflect the laws, regulations, and general
          policies from which they are derived."

          There are a number of policy statements that are related to
          mandatory security.

          Executive Order 12356 (Section 4.1.a) states that "a person is
          eligible for access to classified information provided that a
          determination of trustworthiness has been made by agency heads or
          designated officials and provided that such access is essential
          to the accomplishment of lawful and authorized Government
          purposes."[14]

          DoD Regulation 5200.1-R (Chapter I, Section 3) defines a Special
          Access Program as "any program imposing 'need-to-know' or access
          controls beyond those normally provided for access to
          Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret information.  Such a program
          includes, but is not limited to, special clearance, adjudication,
          or investigative requirements, special designation of officials
          authorized to determine 'need-to-know', or special lists of persons
          determined to have a 'need-to- know.'"[7, para.  1-328] This
          passage distinguishes between a 'discretionary' determination of
          need-to-know and formal need-to-know which is implemented through
          Special Access Programs.  DoD Regulation 5200.1-R, paragraph 7-100
          describes general requirements for trustworthiness (clearance) and
          need-to-know, and states that the individual with possession,
          knowledge or control of classified information has final
          responsibility for determining if conditions for access have been
          met.  This regulation further stipulates that "no one has a right
          to have access to classified information solely by virtue of rank
          or position." [7, para. 7-100])

          DoD Manual 5200.28-M (Section II 2-100) states that, "Personnel
          who develop, test (debug), maintain, or use programs which are
          classified or which will be used to access or develop classified
          material shall have a personnel security clearance and an access
          authorization (need-to-know), as appropriate for the highest
          classified and most restrictive category of classified material
          which they will access under system constraints."[9]

          DoD Manual 5220.22-M (Paragraph 3.a) defines access as "the
          ability and opportunity to obtain knowledge of classified
          information.  An individual, in fact, may have access to
          classified information by being in a place where such information
          is kept, if the security measures which are in force do not
          prevent him from gaining knowledge of the classified
          information."[11]

          The above mentioned Executive Order, Manual, Directives and
          Regulations clearly imply that a trusted computer system must
          assure that the classification labels associated with sensitive
          data cannot be arbitrarily changed, since this could permit
          individuals who lack the appropriate clearance to access
          classified information.  Also implied is the requirement that a
          trusted computer system must control the flow of information so
          that data from a higher classification cannot be placed in a
          storage object of lower classification unless its "downgrading"
          has been authorized.

     7.3.3  Discretionary Security

          The term discretionary security refers to a computer system's
          ability to control information on an individual basis.  It stems
          from the fact that even though an individual has all the formal
          clearances for access to specific classified information, each
          individual's access to information must be based on a demonstrated
          need-to-know.  Because of this, it must be made clear that this
          requirement is not discretionary in a "take it or leave it" sense.
          The directives and regulations are explicit in stating that the
          need-to-know test must be satisfied before access can be granted
          to the classified information.  The control objective for
          discretionary security is: "Security policies defined for systems
          that are used to process classified or other sensitive information
          must include provisions for the enforcement of discretionary
          access control rules.  That is, they must include a consistent set
          of rules for controlling and limiting access based on identified
          individuals who have been determined to have a need-to-know for the
          information."

          DoD Regulation 5200.1-R (Paragraph 7-100) In addition to excerpts
          already provided that touch on need-to- know, this section of the
          regulation stresses the need- to-know principle when it states "no
          person may have access to classified information unless .  .  .
          access is necessary for the performance of official duties."[7]

          Also, DoD Manual 5220.22-M (Section III 20.a) states that "an
          individual shall be permitted to have access to classified
          information only . . . when the contractor determines that access
          is necessary in the performance of tasks or services essential to
          the fulfillment of a contract or program, i.e., the individual has
          a need-to-know."[11]

7.4  Criteria Control Objective for Accountability

     The control objective for accountability is: "Systems that are used to
     process or handle classified or other sensitive information must assure
     individual accountability whenever either a mandatory or discretionary
     security policy is invoked.  Furthermore, to assure accountability the
     capability must exist for an authorized and competent agent to access and
     evaluate accountability information by a secure means, within a reasonable
     amount of time, and without undue difficulty."

     This control objective is supported by the following citations:

     DoD Directive 5200.28 (VI.A.1) states: "Each user's identity shall be
     positively established, and his access to the system, and his activity in
     the system (including material accessed and actions taken) controlled and
     open to scrutiny."[8]

     DoD Manual 5200.28-M (Section V 5-100) states: "An audit log or file
     (manual, machine, or a combination of both) shall be maintained as a
     history of the use of the ADP System to permit a regular security review
     of system activity.  (e.g., The log should record security related
     transactions, including each access to a classified file and the nature
     of the access, e.g., logins, production of accountable classified
     outputs, and creation of new classified files.  Each classified file
     successfully accessed [regardless of the number of individual references]
     during each 'job' or 'interactive session' should also be recorded in the
     audit log.  Much of the material in this log may also be required to
     assure that the system preserves information entrusted to it.)"[9]

     DoD Manual 5200.28-M (Section IV 4-305f) states: "Where needed to assure
     control of access and individual accountability, each user or specific
     group of users shall be identified to the ADP System by appropriate
     administrative or hardware/software measures.  Such identification
     measures must be in sufficient detail to enable the ADP System to provide
     the user only that material which he is authorized."[9]

     DoD Manual 5200.28-M (Section I 1-102b) states:

        "Component's Designated Approving Authorities, or their designees
         for this purpose .  .  .  will assure:

                 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

           (4) Maintenance of documentation on operating systems (O/S)
           and all modifications thereto, and its retention for a
           sufficient period of time to enable tracing of security-
           related defects to their point of origin or inclusion in the
           system.

                 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

           (6) Establishment of procedures to discover, recover,
           handle, and dispose of classified material improperly
           disclosed through system malfunction or personnel action.

           (7) Proper disposition and correction of security
           deficiencies in all approved ADP Systems, and the effective
           use and disposition of system housekeeping or audit records,
           records of security violations or security-related system
           malfunctions, and records of tests of the security features
           of an ADP System."[9]

     DoD Manual 5220.22-M (Section XIII 111) states: "Audit Trails

           a. The general security requirement for any ADP system audit
           trail is that it provide a documented history of the use of
           the system.  An approved audit trail will permit review of
           classified system activity and will provide a detailed
           activity record to facilitate reconstruction of events to
           determine the magnitude of compromise (if any) should a
           security malfunction occur.  To fulfill this basic
           requirement, audit trail systems, manual, automated or a
           combination of both must document significant events
           occurring in the following areas of concern: (i) preparation
           of input data and dissemination of output data (i.e.,
           reportable interactivity between users and system support
           personnel), (ii) activity involved within an ADP environment
           (e.g., ADP support personnel modification of security and
           related controls), and (iii) internal machine activity.

           b. The audit trail for an ADP system approved to process
           classified information must be based on the above three
           areas and may be stylized to the particular system.  All
           systems approved for classified processing should contain
           most if not all of the audit trail records listed below. The
           contractor's SPP documentation must identify and describe
           those applicable:

                      1. Personnel access;

                      2. Unauthorized and surreptitious entry into the
           central computer facility or remote terminal areas;

                      3. Start/stop time of classified processing indicating
           pertinent systems security initiation and termination events
           (e.g., upgrading/downgrading actions pursuant to paragraph
           107);

                      4. All functions initiated by ADP system console
           operators;

                      5. Disconnects of remote terminals and peripheral
           devices (paragraph 107c);

                      6. Log-on and log-off user activity;

                      7. Unauthorized attempts to access files or programs,
           as well as all open, close, create, and file destroy
           actions;

                      8. Program aborts and anomalies including
           identification information (i.e., user/program name, time
           and location of incident, etc.);

                      9. System hardware additions, deletions and maintenance
           actions;

                      10. Generations and modifications affecting the
           security features of the system software.

           c. The ADP system security supervisor or designee shall
           review the audit trail logs at least weekly to assure that
           all pertinent activity is properly recorded and that
           appropriate action has been taken to correct any anomaly.
           The majority of ADP systems in use today can develop audit
           trail systems in accord with the above; however, special
           systems such as weapons, communications, communications
           security, and tactical data exchange and display systems,
           may not be able to comply with all aspects of the above and
           may require individualized consideration by the cognizant
           security office.

           d. Audit trail records shall be retained for a period of one
           inspection cycle."[11]

7.5  Criteria Control Objective for Assurance

     The control objective for assurance is: "Systems that are used to process
     or handle classified or other sensitive information must be designed to
     guarantee correct and accurate interpretation of the security policy and
     must not distort the intent of that policy.  Assurance must be provided
     that correct implementation and operation of the policy exists throughout
     the system's life-cycle."

     A basis for this objective can be found in the following sections of DoD
     Directive 5200.28:

     DoD Directive 5200.28 (IV.B.1) stipulates: "Generally, security of an ADP
     system is most effective and economical if the system is designed
     originally to provide it.  Each Department of Defense Component
     undertaking design of an ADP system which is expected to process, store,
     use, or produce classified material shall:  From the beginning of the
     design process, consider the security policies, concepts, and measures
     prescribed in this Directive."[8]

     DoD Directive 5200.28 (IV.C.5.a) states: "Provision may be made to permit
     adjustment of ADP system area controls to the level of protection
     required for the classification category and type(s) of material actually
     being handled by the system, provided change procedures are developed and
     implemented which will prevent both the unauthorized access to classified
     material handled by the system and the unauthorized manipulation of the
     system and its components.  Particular attention shall be given to the
     continuous protection of automated system security measures, techniques
     and procedures when the personnel security clearance level of users
     having access to the system changes."[8]

     DoD Directive 5200.28 (VI.A.2) states: "Environmental Control.  The ADP
     System shall be externally protected to minimize the likelihood of
     unauthorized access to system entry points, access to classified
     information in the system, or damage to the system."[8]

     DoD Manual 5200.28-M (Section I 1-102b) states:

        "Component's Designated Approving Authorities, or their designees
        for this purpose .  .  .  will assure:

                  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

              (5) Supervision, monitoring, and testing, as appropriate, of
          changes in an approved ADP System which could affect the
          security features of the system, so that a secure system is
          maintained.

                  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

              (7) Proper disposition and correction of security
          deficiencies in all approved ADP Systems, and the effective
          use and disposition of system housekeeping or audit records,
          records of security violations or security-related system
          malfunctions, and records of tests of the security features
          of an ADP System.

              (8) Conduct of competent system ST&E, timely review of
          system ST&E reports, and correction of deficiencies needed
          to support conditional or final approval or disapproval of
          an ADP System for the processing of classified information.

              (9) Establishment, where appropriate, of a central ST&E
          coordination point for the maintenance of records of
          selected techniques, procedures, standards, and tests used
          in the testing and evaluation of security features of ADP
          Systems which may be suitable for validation and use by
          other Department of Defense Components."[9]

     DoD Manual 5220.22-M (Section XIII 103a) requires: "the initial approval,
     in writing, of the cognizant security office prior to processing any
     classified information in an ADP system.  This section requires
     reapproval by the cognizant security office for major system
     modifications made subsequent to initial approval.  Reapprovals will be
     required because of (i) major changes in personnel access requirements,
     (ii) relocation or structural modification of the central computer
     facility, (iii) additions, deletions or changes to main frame, storage or
     input/output devices, (iv) system software changes impacting security
     protection features, (v) any change in clearance, declassification, audit
     trail or hardware/software maintenance procedures, and (vi) other system
     changes as determined by the cognizant security office."[11]

     A major component of assurance, life-cycle assurance, is concerned with
     testing ADP systems both in the development phase as well as during
     operation.  DoD Directive 5215.1 (Section F.2.C.(2)) requires
     "evaluations of selected industry and government-developed trusted
     computer systems against these criteria."[10]



8.0  A GUIDELINE ON COVERT CHANNELS

A covert channel is any communication channel that can be exploited by a
process to transfer information in a manner that violates the system's
security policy.  There are two types of covert channels: storage channels and
timing channels.  Covert storage channels include all vehicles that would
allow the direct or indirect writing of a storage location by one process and
the direct or indirect reading of it by another.  Covert timing channels
include all vehicles that would allow one process to signal information to
another process by modulating its own use of system resources in such a way
that the change in response time observed by the second process would provide
information.

>From a security perspective, covert channels with low bandwidths represent a
lower threat than those with high bandwidths.  However, for many types of
covert channels, techniques used to reduce the bandwidth below a certain rate
(which depends on the specific channel mechanism and the system architecture)
also have the effect of degrading the performance provided to legitimate
system users.  Hence, a trade-off between system performance and covert
channel bandwidth must be made.  Because of the threat of compromise that
would be present in any multilevel computer system containing classified or
sensitive information, such systems should not contain covert channels with
high bandwidths.  This guideline is intended to provide system developers with
an idea of just how high a "high" covert channel bandwidth is.

A covert channel bandwidth that exceeds a rate of one hundred (100) bits per
second is considered "high" because 100 bits per second is the approximate
rate at which many computer terminals are run.  It does not seem appropriate
to call a computer system "secure" if information can be compromised at a rate
equal to the normal output rate of some commonly used device.

In any multilevel computer system there are a number of relatively
low-bandwidth covert channels whose existence is deeply ingrained in the
system design.  Faced with the large potential cost of reducing the bandwidths
of such covert channels, it is felt that those with maximum bandwidths of less
than one (1) bit per second are acceptable in most application environments.
Though maintaining acceptable performance in some systems may make it
impractical to eliminate all covert channels with bandwidths of 1 or more bits
per second, it is possible to audit their use without adversely affecting
system performance.  This audit capability provides the system administration
with a means of detecting -- and procedurally correcting -- significant
compromise.  Therefore, a Trusted Computing Base should provide, wherever
possible, the capability to audit the use of covert channel mechanisms with
bandwidths that may exceed a rate of one (1) bit in ten (10) seconds.

The covert channel problem has been addressed by a number of authors.  The
interested reader is referred to references [5], [6], [19], [21], [22], [23],
and [29].



9.0  A GUIDELINE ON CONFIGURING MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL FEATURES

The Mandatory Access Control requirement includes a capability to support an
unspecified number of hierarchical classifications and an unspecified number
of non-hierarchical categories at each hierarchical level.  To encourage
consistency and portability in the design and development of the National
Security Establishment trusted computer systems, it is desirable for all such
systems to be able to support a minimum number of levels and categories.  The
following suggestions are provided for this purpose:

     * The number of hierarchical classifications should be greater than or
       equal to eight (8).

     * The number of non-hierarchical categories should be greater than or
       equal to twenty-nine (29).



10.0  A GUIDELINE ON SECURITY TESTING

These guidelines are provided to give an indication of the extent and
sophistication of testing undertaken by the DoD Computer Security Center
during the Formal Product Evaluation process.  Organizations wishing to use
"Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria" for
performing their own evaluations may find this section useful for planning
purposes.

As in Part I, highlighting is used to indicate changes in the guidelines from

                                    APPENDIX A

                     Commercial Product Evaluation Process


"Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria" forms the
basis upon which the Computer Security Center will carry out the commercial
computer security evaluation process.  This process is focused on commercially
produced and supported general-purpose operating system products that meet the
needs of government departments and agencies.  The formal evaluation is aimed
at "off-the-shelf" commercially supported products and is completely divorced
>from any consideration of overall system performance, potential applications,
or particular processing environments.  The evaluation provides a key input to
a computer system security approval/accreditation.  However, it does not
constitute a complete computer system security evaluation.  A complete study
(e.g., as in reference [18]) must consider additional factors dealing with the
system in its unique environment, such as it's proposed security mode of
operation, specific users, applications, data sensitivity, physical and
personnel security, administrative and procedural security, TEMPEST, and
communications security.

The product evaluation process carried out by the Computer Security Center has
three distinct elements:

     * Preliminary Product Evaluation - An informal dialogue between a vendor
       and the Center in which technical information is exchanged to create a
       common understanding of the vendor's product, the criteria, and the
       rating that may be expected to result from a formal product evaluation.

     * Formal Product Evaluation - A formal evaluation, by the Center, of a
       product that is available to the DoD, and that results in that product
       and its assigned rating being placed on the Evaluated Products List.

     * Evaluated Products List - A list of products that have been subjected
       to formal product evaluation and their assigned ratings.


PRELIMINARY PRODUCT EVALUATION

Since it is generally very difficult to add effective security measures late
in a product's life cycle, the Center is interested in working with system
vendors in the early stages of product design.  A preliminary product
evaluation allows the Center to consult with computer vendors on computer
security issues found in products that have not yet been formally announced.

A preliminary evaluation is typically initiated by computer system vendors who
are planning new computer products that feature security or major
security-related upgrades to existing products.  After an initial meeting
between the vendor and the Center, appropriate non-disclosure agreements are
executed that require the Center to maintain the confidentiality of any
proprietary information disclosed to it.  Technical exchange meetings follow
in which the vendor provides details about the proposed product (particularly
its internal designs and goals) and the Center provides expert feedback to the
vendor on potential computer security strengths and weaknesses of the vendor's
design choices, as well as relevant interpretation of the criteria.  The
preliminary evaluation is typically terminated when the product is completed
and ready for field release by the vendor.  Upon termination, the Center
prepares a wrap-up report for the vendor and for internal distribution within
the Center.  Those reports containing proprietary information are not
available to the public.

During preliminary evaluation, the vendor is under no obligation to actually
complete or market the potential product.  The Center is, likewise, not
committed to conduct a formal product evaluation.  A preliminary evaluation
may be terminated by either the Center or the vendor when one notifies the
other, in writing, that it is no longer advantageous to continue the
evaluation.


FORMAL PRODUCT EVALUATION

The formal product evaluation provides a key input to certification of a
computer system for use in National Security Establishment applications and is
the sole basis for a product being placed on the Evaluated Products List.

A formal product evaluation begins with a request by a vendor for the Center
to evaluate a product for which the product itself and accompanying
documentation needed to meet the requirements defined by this publication are
complete.  Non-disclosure agreements are executed and a formal product
evaluation team is formed by the Center.  An initial meeting is then held with
the vendor to work out the schedule for the formal evaluation.  Since testing
of the implemented product forms an important part of the evaluation process,
access by the evaluation team to a working version of the system is negotiated
with the vendor.  Additional support required from the vendor includes
complete design documentation, source code, and access to vendor personnel who
can answer detailed questions about specific portions of the product.  The
evaluation team tests the product against each requirement, making any
necessary interpretations of the criteria with respect to the product being
evaluated.

The evaluation team writes a two-part final report on their findings about the
system.  The first part is publicly available (containing no proprietary
information) and contains the overall class rating assigned to the system and
the details of the evaluation team's findings when comparing the product
against the evaluation criteria.  The second part of the evaluation report
contains vulnerability analyses and other detailed information supporting the
rating decision.  Since this part may contain proprietary or other sensitive
information it will be distributed only within the U.S.  Government on a
strict need-to-know and non- disclosure basis, and to the vendor.  No portion
of the evaluation results will be withheld from the vendor.







                                   APPENDIX B

                   Summary of Evaluation Criteria Divisions

The divisions of systems recognized under the trusted computer system
evaluation criteria are as follows.  Each division represents a major
improvement in the overall confidence one can place in the system to protect
classified and other sensitive information.

Division (D):  Minimal Protection

This division contains only one class.  It is reserved for those systems that
have been evaluated but that fail to meet the requirements for a higher
evaluation class.

Division (C):  Discretionary Protection

Classes in this division provide for discretionary (need-to-know) protection
and, through the inclusion of audit capabilities, for accountability of
subjects and the actions they initiate.

Division (B):  Mandatory Protection

The notion of a TCB that preserves the integrity of sensitivity labels and
uses them to enforce a set of mandatory access control rules is a major
requirement in this division.  Systems in this division must carry the
sensitivity labels with major data structures in the system.  The system
developer also provides the security policy model on which the TCB is based
and furnishes a specification of the TCB.  Evidence must be provided to
demonstrate that the reference monitor concept has been implemented.

Division (A):  Verified Protection

This division is characterized by the use of formal security verification
methods to assure that the mandatory and discretionary security controls
employed in the system can effectively protect classified or other sensitive
information stored or processed by the system.  Extensive documentation is
required to demonstrate that the TCB meets the security requirements in all
aspects of design, development and implementation.





                                   APPENDIX C

                    Summary of Evaluation Criteria Classes

The classes of systems recognized under the trusted computer system evaluation
criteria are as follows.  They are presented in the order of increasing
desirablity from a computer security point of view.

Class (D):  Minimal Protection

This class is reserved for those systems that have been evaluated but that
fail to meet the requirements for a higher evaluation class.

Class (C1):  Discretionary Security Protection

The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of a class (C1) system nominally satisfies
the discretionary security requirements by providing separation of users and
data.  It incorporates some form of credible controls capable of enforcing
access limitations on an individual basis, i.e., ostensibly suitable for
allowing users to be able to protect project or private information and to
keep other users from accidentally reading or destroying their data.  The
class (C1) environment is expected to be one of cooperating users processing
data at the same level(s) of sensitivity.

Class (C2):  Controlled Access Protection

Systems in this class enforce a more finely grained discretionary access
control than (C1) systems, making users individually accountable for their
actions through login procedures, auditing of security-relevant events, and
resource isolation.

Class (B1):  Labeled Security Protection

Class (B1) systems require all the features required for class (C2).  In
addition, an informal statement of the security policy model, data labeling,
and mandatory access control over named subjects and objects must be present.
The capability must exist for accurately labeling exported information.  Any
flaws identified by testing must be removed.

Class (B2):  Structured Protection

In class (B2) systems, the TCB is based on a clearly defined and documented
formal security policy model that requires the discretionary and mandatory
access control enforcement found in class (B1) systems be extended to all
subjects and objects in the ADP system.  In addition, covert channels are
addressed.  The TCB must be carefully structured into protection-critical and
non- protection-critical elements.  The TCB interface is well-defined and the
TCB design and implementation enable it to be subjected to more thorough
testing and more complete review.  Authentication mechanisms are strengthened,
trusted facility management is provided in the form of support for system
administrator and operator functions, and stringent configuration management
controls are imposed.  The system is relatively resistant to penetration.

Class (B3):  Security Domains

The class (B3) TCB must satisfy the reference monitor requirements that it
mediate all accesses of subjects to objects, be tamperproof, and be small
enough to be subjected to analysis and tests.  To this end, the TCB is
structured to exclude code not essential to security policy enforcement, with
significant system engineering during TCB design and implementation directed
toward minimizing its complexity.  A security administrator is supported,
audit mechanisms are expanded to signal security- relevant events, and system
recovery procedures are required.  The system is highly resistant to
penetration.

Class (A1):  Verified Design

Systems in class (A1) are functionally equivalent to those in class (B3) in
that no additional architectural features or policy requirements are added.
The distinguishing feature of systems in this class is the analysis derived
>from formal design specification and verification techniques and the resulting
high degree of assurance that the TCB is correctly implemented.  This
assurance is developmental in nature, starting with a formal model of the
security policy and a formal top-level specification (FTLS) of the design.  In
keeping with the extensive design and development analysis of the TCB required
of systems in class (A1), more stringent configuration management is required
and procedures are established for securely distributing the system to sites.
A system security administrator is supported.

                              Requirement Directory

This appendix lists requirements defined in "Department of Defense Trusted
Computer System Evaluation Criteria" alphabetically rather than by class.  It
is provided to assist in following the evolution of a requirement through the
classes.  For each requirement, three types of criteria may be present.  Each
will be preceded by the word: NEW, CHANGE, or ADD to indicate the following:

              NEW: Any criteria appearing in a lower class are superseded
                   by the criteria that follow.

           CHANGE: The criteria that follow have appeared in a lower class
                   but are changed for this class.  Highlighting is used
                   to indicate the specific changes to previously stated
                   criteria.

              ADD: The criteria that follow have not been required for any
                   lower class, and are added in this class to the
                   previously stated criteria for this requirement.

Abbreviations are used as follows:

               NR: (No Requirement) This requirement is not included in
                   this class.

              NAR: (No Additional Requirements) This requirement does not
                   change from the previous class.

The reader is referred to Part I of this document when placing new criteria
for a requirement into the complete context for that class.

Figure 1 provides a pictorial summary of the evolution of requirements through
the classes.


Audit

     C1: NR.

     C2: NEW: The TCB shall be able to create, maintain, and protect from
         modification or unauthorized access or destruction an audit trail of
         accesses to the objects it protects.  The audit data shall be
         protected by the TCB so that read access to it is limited to those
         who are authorized for audit data.  The TCB shall be able to record
         the following types of events:  use of identification and
         authentication mechanisms, introduction of objects into a user's
         address space (e.g., file open, program initiation), deletion of
         objects, and actions taken by computer operators and system
         administrators and/or system security officers.  For each recorded
         event, the audit record shall identify: date and time of the event,
         user, type of event, and success or failure of the event.  For
         identification/authentication events the origin of request (e.g.,
         terminal ID) shall be included in the audit record.  For events that
         introduce an object into a user's address space and for object
         deletion events the audit record shall include the name of the object.
         The ADP system administrator shall be able to selectively audit the
         actions of any one or more users based on individual identity.

     B1: CHANGE: For events that introduce an object into a user's address
         space and for object deletion events the audit record shall include
         the name of the object and the object's security level.  The ADP
         system administrator shall be able to selectively audit the actions
         of any one or more users based on individual identity and/or object
         security level.

         ADD: The TCB shall also be able to audit any override of
         human-readable output markings.

     B2: ADD: The TCB shall be able to audit the identified events that may be
         used in the exploitation of covert storage channels.

     B3: ADD: The TCB shall contain a mechanism that is able to monitor the
         occurrence or accumulation of security auditable events that may
         indicate an imminent violation of security policy.  This mechanism
         shall be able to immediately notify the security administrator when
         thresholds are exceeded.

     A1: NAR.

Configuration Management

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NR.

     B2: NEW: During development and maintenance of the TCB, a configuration
         management system shall be in place that maintains control of changes
         to the descriptive top-level specification, other design data,
         implementation documentation, source code, the running version of the
         object code, and test fixtures and documentation.  The configuration
         management system shall assure a consistent mapping among all
         documentation and code associated with the current version of the TCB.
         Tools shall be provided for generation of a new version of the TCB
         from source code.  Also available shall be tools for comparing a
         newly generated version with the previous TCB version in order to
         ascertain that only the intended changes have been made in the code
         that will actually be used as the new version of the TCB.

     B3: NAR.

     A1: CHANGE: During the entire life-cycle, i.e., during the design,
         development, and maintenance of the TCB, a configuration management
         system shall be in place for all security-relevant hardware, firmware,
         and software that maintains control of changes to the formal model,
         the descriptive and formal top-level specifications, other design
         data, implementation documentation, source code, the running version
         of the object code, and test fixtures and documentation.  Also
         available shall be tools, maintained under strict configuration
         control, for comparing a newly generated version with the previous
         TCB version in order to ascertain that only the intended changes have
         been made in the code that will actually be used as the new version
         of the TCB.

    ADD: A combination of technical, physical, and procedural safeguards
         shall be used to protect from unauthorized modification or
         destruction the master copy or copies of all material used to
         generate the TCB.

Covert Channel Analysis

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NR.

     B2: NEW: The system developer shall conduct a thorough search for covert
         storage channels and make a determination (either by actual
         measurement or by engineering estimation) of the maximum bandwidth of
         each identified channel.  (See the Covert Channels Guideline section.)

     B3: CHANGE: The system developer shall conduct a thorough search for
         covert channels and make a determination (either by actual
         measurement or by engineering estimation) of the maximum bandwidth
         of each identified channel.

     A1: ADD: Formal methods shall be used in the analysis.

Design Documentation

     C1: NEW: Documentation shall be available that provides a description of
         the manufacturer's philosophy of protection and an explanation of how
         this philosophy is translated into the TCB.  If the TCB is composed
         of distinct modules, the interfaces between these modules shall be
         described.

     C2: NAR.

     B1: ADD: An informal or formal description of the security policy model
         enforced by the TCB shall be available and an explanation provided to
         show that it is sufficient to enforce the security policy.  The
         specific TCB protection mechanisms shall be identified and an
         explanation given to show that they satisfy the model.

     B2: CHANGE: The interfaces between the TCB modules shall be described.  A
         formal description of the security policy model enforced by the TCB
         shall be available and proven that it is sufficient to enforce the
         security policy.

         ADD: The descriptive top-level specification (DTLS) shall be shown to
         be an accurate description of the TCB interface.  Documentation shall
         describe how the TCB implements the reference monitor concept and
         give an explanation why it is tamperproof, cannot be bypassed, and is
         correctly implemented.  Documentation shall describe how the TCB is
         structured to facilitate testing and to enforce least privilege.
         This documentation shall also present the results of the covert
         channel analysis and the tradeoffs involved in restricting the
         channels.  All auditable events that may be used in the exploitation
         of known covert storage channels shall be identified.  The bandwidths
         of known covert storage channels, the use of which is not detectable
         by the auditing mechanisms, shall be provided.  (See the Covert
         Channel Guideline section.)

     B3: ADD: The TCB implementation (i.e., in hardware, firmware, and
         software) shall be informally shown to be consistent with the DTLS.
         The elements of the DTLS shall be shown, using informal techniques,
         to correspond to the elements of the TCB.

     A1: CHANGE: The TCB implementation (i.e., in hardware, firmware, and
         software) shall be informally shown to be consistent with the formal
         top-level specification (FTLS).  The elements of the FTLS shall be
         shown, using informal techniques, to correspond to the elements of
         the TCB.

         ADD: Hardware, firmware, and software mechanisms not dealt with in
         the FTLS but strictly internal to the TCB (e.g., mapping registers,
         direct memory access I/O) shall be clearly described.

Design Specification and Verification

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NEW: An informal or formal model of the security policy supported by
         the TCB shall be maintained that is shown to be consistent with its
         axioms.

     B2: CHANGE: A formal model of the security policy supported by the TCB
         shall be maintained that is proven consistent with its axioms.

         ADD: A descriptive top-level specification (DTLS) of the TCB shall be
         maintained that completely and accurately describes the TCB in terms
         of exceptions, error messages, and effects.  It shall be shown to be
         an accurate description of the TCB interface.

     B3: ADD: A convincing argument shall be given that the DTLS is consistent
         with the model.

     A1: CHANGE: The FTLS shall be shown to be an accurate description of the
         TCB interface.  A convincing argument shall be given that the DTLS is
         consistent with the model and a combination of formal and informal
         techniques shall be used to show that the FTLS is consistent with the
         model.

         ADD: A formal top-level specification (FTLS) of the TCB shall be
         maintained that accurately describes the TCB in terms of exceptions,
         error messages, and effects.  The DTLS and FTLS shall include those
         components of the TCB that are implemented as hardware and/or
         firmware if their properties are visible at the TCB interface.  This
         verification evidence shall be consistent with that provided within
         the state-of-the-art of the particular Computer Security Center-
         endorsed formal specification and verification system used.  Manual
         or other mapping of the FTLS to the TCB source code shall be
         performed to provide evidence of correct implementation.

Device Labels

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NR.

     B2: NEW: The TCB shall support the assignment of minimum and maximum
         security levels to all attached physical devices.  These security
         levels shall be used by the TCB to enforce constraints imposed by
         the physical environments in which the devices are located.

     B3: NAR.

     A1: NAR.

Discretionary Access Control

     C1: NEW: The TCB shall define and control access between named users and
         named objects (e.g., files and programs) in the ADP system.  The
         enforcement mechanism (e.g., self/group/public controls, access
         control lists) shall allow users to specify and control sharing of
         those objects by named individuals or defined groups or both.

     C2: CHANGE: The enforcement mechanism (e.g., self/group/public controls,
         access control lists) shall allow users to specify and control
         sharing of those objects by named individuals, or defined groups of
         individuals, or by both.

    ADD: The discretionary access control mechanism shall, either by explicit
         user action or by default, provide that objects are protected from
         unauthorized access.  These access controls shall be capable of
         including or excluding access to the granularity of a single user.
         Access permission to an object by users not already possessing access
         permission shall only be assigned by authorized users.

     B1: NAR.

     B2: NAR.

     B3: CHANGE: The enforcement mechanism (e.g., access control lists) shall
         allow users to specify and control sharing of those objects.  These
         access controls shall be capable of specifying, for each named
         object, a list of named individuals and a list of groups of named
         individuals with their respective modes of access to that object.

    ADD: Furthermore, for each such named object, it shall be possible to
         specify a list of named individuals and a list of groups of named
         individuals for which no access to the object is to be given.

     A1: NAR.

Exportation of Labeled Information

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NEW: The TCB shall designate each communication channel and I/O
         device as either single-level or multilevel.  Any change in this
         designation shall be done manually and shall be auditable by the
         TCB.  The TCB shall maintain and be able to audit any change in the
         current security level associated with a single-level communication
         channel or I/O device.

     B2: NAR.

     B3: NAR.

     A1: NAR.

Exportation to Multilevel Devices

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NEW: When the TCB exports an object to a multilevel I/O device, the
         sensitivity label associated with that object shall also be exported
         and shall reside on the same physical medium as the exported
         information and shall be in the same form (i.e., machine-readable or
         human-readable form).  When the TCB exports or imports an object over
         a multilevel communication channel, the protocol used on that channel
         shall provide for the unambiguous pairing between the sensitivity
         labels and the associated information that is sent or received.

     B2: NAR.

     B3: NAR.

     A1: NAR.

Exportation to Single-Level Devices

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NEW: Single-level I/O devices and single-level communication channels
         are not required to maintain the sensitivity labels of the
         information they process.  However, the TCB shall include a mechanism
         by which the TCB and an authorized user reliably communicate to
         designate the single security level of information imported or
         exported via single-level communication channels or I/O devices.

     B2: NAR.

     B3: NAR.

     A1: NAR.

Identification and Authentication

     C1: NEW: The TCB shall require users to identify themselves to it before
         beginning to perform any other actions that the TCB is expected to
         mediate.  Furthermore, the TCB shall use a protected mechanism (e.g.,
         passwords) to authenticate the user's identity.  The TCB shall
         protect authentication data so that it cannot be accessed by any
         unauthorized user.

     C2: ADD: The TCB shall be able to enforce individual accountability by
         providing the capability to uniquely identify each individual ADP
         system user.  The TCB shall also provide the capability of
         associating this identity with all auditable actions taken by that
         individual.

     B1: CHANGE: Furthermore, the TCB shall maintain authentication data that
         includes information for verifying the identity of individual users
         (e.g., passwords) as well as information for determining the
         clearance and authorizations of individual users.  This data shall be
         used by the TCB to authenticate the user's identity and to determine
         the security level and authorizations of subjects that may be created
         to act on behalf of the individual user.

Label Integrity

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NEW: Sensitivity labels shall accurately represent security levels of
         the specific subjects or objects with which they are associated.  When
         exported by the TCB, sensitivity labels shall accurately and
         unambiguously represent the internal labels and shall be associated
         with the information being exported.

Labeling Human-Readable Output

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NEW: The ADP system administrator shall be able to specify the
         printable label names associated with exported sensitivity labels.
         The TCB shall mark the beginning and end of all human-readable,
         paged, hardcopy output (e.g., line printer output) with human-
         readable sensitivity labels that properly* represent the sensitivity
         of the output.  The TCB shall, by default, mark the top and bottom of
         each page of human-readable, paged, hardcopy output (e.g., line
         printer output) with human-readable sensitivity labels that
         properly* represent the overall sensitivity of the output or that
         properly* represent the sensitivity of the information on the page.
         The TCB shall, by default and in an appropriate manner, mark other
         forms of human-readable output (e.g., maps, graphics) with human-
         readable sensitivity labels that properly* represent the sensitivity
         of the output.  Any override of these marking defaults shall be
         auditable by the TCB.

           ____________________________________________________________
           * The hierarchical classification component in human-readable
           sensitivity labels shall be equal to the greatest
           hierarchical classification of any of the information in the
           output that the labels refer to;  the non-hierarchical
           category component shall include all of the non-hierarchical
           categories of the information in the output the labels refer
           to, but no other non-hierarchical categories.
           ____________________________________________________________


Labels

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NEW: Sensitivity labels associated with each subject and storage
         object under its control (e.g., process, file, segment, device) shall
         be maintained by the TCB.  These labels shall be used as the basis
         for mandatory access control decisions.  In order to import non-
         labeled data, the TCB shall request and receive from an authorized
         user the security level of the data, and all such actions shall be
         auditable by the TCB.

     B2: CHANGE: Sensitivity labels associated with each ADP system resource
         (e.g., subject, storage object) that is directly or indirectly
         accessible by subjects external to the TCB shall be maintained by
         the TCB.

     B3: NAR.

     A1: NAR.

Mandatory Access Control

     C1: NR.

     C2: NR.

     B1: NEW: The TCB shall enforce a mandatory access control policy over all
         subjects and storage objects under its control (e.g., processes,
         files, segments, devices).  These subjects and objects shall be
         assigned sensitivity labels that are a combination of hierarchical
         classification levels and non-hierarchical categories, and the labels
         shall be used as the basis for mandatory access control decisions.
         The TCB shall be able to support two or more such security levels.
         (See the Mandatory Access Control guidelines.)  The following
         requirements shall hold for all accesses between subjects and objects
         controlled by the TCB: A subject can read an object only if the
         hierarchical classification in the subject's security level is
         greater than or equal to the hierarchical classification in the
         object's security level and the non-hierarchical categories in the
         subject's security level include all the non-hierarchical categories
         in the object's security level.  A subject can write an object only
         if the hierarchical classification in the subject's security level is
         less than or equal to the hierarchical classification in the object's
         security level and all the non-hierarchical categories in the
         subject's security level are included in the non-hierarchical
         categories in the object's security level.

     B2: CHANGE: The TCB shall enforce a mandatory access control policy over
         all resources (i.e., subjects, storage objects, and I/O devices) that
         are directly or indirectly accessible by subjects external to the TCB.
         The following requirements shall hold for all accesses between all
         subjects external to the TCB and all objects directly or indirectly
         accessible by these subjects:

     C1: NR.

     C2: NEW: When a storage object is initially assigned, allocated, or
         reallocated to a subject from the TCB's pool of unused storage
         objects, the TCB shall assure that the object contains no data for
         which the subject is not authorized.

Security Testing

     C1: NEW: The security mechanisms of the ADP system shall be tested and
         found to work as claimed in the system documentation.  Testing shall
         be done to assure that there are no obvious ways for an unauthorized
         user to bypass or otherwise defeat the security protection mechanisms
         of the TCB.  (See the Security Testing guidelines.)

     C2: ADD: Testing shall also include a search for obvious flaws that would
         allow violation of resource isolation, or that would permit
         unauthorized access to the audit or authentication data.

     B1: NEW: The security mechanisms of the ADP system shall be tested and
         found to work as claimed in the system documentation.  A team of
         individuals who thoroughly understand the specific implementation of
         the TCB shall subject its design documentation, source code, and
         object code to thorough analysis and testing.  Their objectives shall
         be: to uncover all design and implementation flaws that would permit
         a subject external to the TCB to read, change, or delete data
         normally denied under the mandatory or discretionary security policy
         enforced by the TCB; as well as to assure that no subject (without
         authorization to do so) is able to cause the TCB to enter a state
         such that it is unable to respond to communications initiated by
         other users.  All discovered flaws shall be removed or neutralized
         and the TCB retested to demonstrate that they have been eliminated
         and that new flaws have not been introduced.  (See the Security
         Testing Guidelines.)

     B2: CHANGE: All discovered flaws shall be corrected and the TCB retested
         to demonstrate that they have been eliminated and that new flaws have
         not been introduced.

         ADD: The TCB shall be found relatively resistant to penetration.
         Testing shall demonstrate that the TCB implementation is consistent
         with the descriptive top-level specification.

     B3: CHANGE: The TCB shall be found resistant to penetration.

         ADD: No design flaws and no more than a few correctable
         implementation flaws may be found during testing and there shall be
         reasonable confidence that few remain.

     A1: CHANGE: Testing shall demonstrate that the TCB implementation is
         consistent with the formal top-level specification.

         ADD: Manual or other mapping of the FTLS to the source code may form
         a basis for penetration testing.

         in the security level associated with that user during an interactive
         session.  A terminal user shall be able to query the TCB as desired
         for a display of the subject's complete sensitivity label.

System Architecture

     C1: NEW: The TCB shall maintain a domain for its own execution that
         protects it from external interference or tampering (e.g., by
         modification of its code or data structures).  Resources controlled
         by the TCB may be a defined subset of the subjects and objects in
         the ADP system.

     C2: ADD: The TCB shall isolate the resources to be protected so that they
         are subject to the access control and auditing requirements.

     B1: ADD: The TCB shall maintain process isolation through the provision
         of distinct address spaces under its control.

     B2: NEW: The TCB shall maintain a domain for its own execution that
         protects it from external interference or tampering (e.g., by
         modification of its code or data structures).  The TCB shall maintain
         process isolation through the provision of distinct address spaces
         under its control.  The TCB shall be internally structured into well-
         defined largely independent modules.  It shall make effective use of
         available hardware to separate those elements that are protection-
         critical from those that are not.  The TCB modules shall be designed
         such that the principle of least privilege is enforced.  Features in
         hardware, such as segmentation, shall be used to support logically
         distinct storage objects with separate attributes (namely: readable,
         writeable).  The user interface to the TCB shall be completely
         defined and all elements of the TCB identified.

     B3: ADD: The TCB shall be designed and structured to use a complete,
         conceptually simple protection mechanism with precisely defined
         semantics.  This mechanism shall play a central role in enforcing the
         internal structuring of the TCB and the system.  The TCB shall
         incorporate significant use of layering, abstraction and data hiding.
         Significant system engineering shall be directed toward minimizing
         the complexity of the TCB and excluding from the TCB modules that are
         not protection-critical.

System Integrity

     C1: NEW: Hardware and/or software features shall be provided that can be

         master copy of the code for the current version.  Procedures (e.g.,
         site security acceptance testing) shall exist for assuring that the
         TCB software, firmware, and hardware updates distributed to a
         customer are exactly as specified by the master copies.

     B3: ADD: The functions performed in the role of a security administrator
         shall be identified.  The ADP system administrative personnel shall
         only be able to perform security administrator functions after taking
         a distinct auditable action to assume the security administrator role
         on the ADP system.  Non-security functions that can be performed in
         the security administration role shall be limited strictly to those

     B1: ADD: The manual shall describe the operator and administrator
         functions related to security, to include changing the
         characteristics of a user.  It shall provide guidelines on the
         consistent and effective use of the protection features of the
         system, how they interact, how to securely generate a new TCB, and
         facility procedures, warnings, and privileges that need to be
         controlled in order to operate the facility in a secure manner.

     B2: ADD: The TCB modules that contain the reference validation mechanism
         shall be identified.  The procedures for secure generation of a new
         TCB from source after modification of any modules in the TCB shall
         be described.

     B3: ADD: It shall include the procedures to ensure that the system is
         initially started in a secure manner.  Procedures shall also be

         itself and user for initial login and authentication.  Communications
         via this path shall be initiated exclusively by a user.

     B3: CHANGE: The TCB shall support a trusted communication path between
         itself and users for use when a positive TCB-to-user connection is
         required (e.g., login, change subject security level).
         Communications via this trusted path shall be activated exclusively

                                 GLOSSARY


Access - A specific type of interaction between a subject and an object
     that results in the flow of information from one to the other.

Approval/Accreditation - The official authorization that is
     granted to an ADP system to process sensitive information in
     its operational environment, based upon comprehensive
     security evaluation of the system's hardware, firmware, and
     software security design, configuration, and implementation
     and of the other system procedural, administrative,
     physical, TEMPEST, personnel, and communications security
     controls.

Audit Trail - A set of records that collectively provide
     documentary evidence of processing used to aid in tracing
     from original transactions forward to related records and
     reports, and/or backwards from records and reports to their
     component source transactions.

Authenticate - To establish the validity of a claimed identity.

Automatic Data Processing (ADP) System - An assembly of computer
     hardware, firmware, and software configured for the purpose
     of classifying, sorting, calculating, computing,
     summarizing, transmitting and receiving, storing, and
     retrieving data with a minimum of human intervention.

Bandwidth - A characteristic of a communication channel that is
     the amount of information that can be passed through it in a
     given amount of time, usually expressed in bits per second.

Bell-LaPadula Model - A formal state transition model of computer
     security policy that describes a set of access control
     rules.  In this formal model, the entities in a computer
     system are divided into abstract sets of subjects and
     objects.  The notion of a secure state is defined and it is
     proven that each state transition preserves security by
     moving from secure state to secure state; thus, inductively
     proving that the system is secure.  A system state is
     defined to be "secure" if the only permitted access modes of
     subjects to objects are in accordance with a specific
     security policy.  In order to determine whether or not a
     specific access mode is allowed, the clearance of a subject
     is compared to the classification of the object and a
     determination is made as to whether the subject is
     authorized for the specific access mode.  The
     clearance/classification scheme is expressed in terms of a
     lattice.  See also: Lattice, Simple Security Property, *-
     Property.

Certification - The technical evaluation of a system's security
     features, made as part of and in support of the
     approval/accreditation process, that establishes the extent
     to which a particular computer system's design and
     implementation meet a set of specified security
     requirements.

Channel - An information transfer path within a system.  May also
     refer to the mechanism by which the path is effected.

Covert Channel - A communication channel that allows a process to
     transfer information in a manner that violates the system's
     security policy.  See also:  Covert Storage Channel, Covert
     Timing Channel.

Covert Storage Channel - A covert channel that involves the
     direct or indirect writing of a storage location by one
     process and the direct or indirect reading of the storage
     location by another process.  Covert storage channels
     typically involve a finite resource (e.g., sectors on a
     disk) that is shared by two subjects at different security
     levels.

Covert Timing Channel - A covert channel in which one process
     signals information to another by modulating its own use of
     system resources (e.g., CPU time) in such a way that this
     manipulation affects the real response time observed by the
     second process.

Data - Information with a specific physical representation.

Data Integrity - The state that exists when computerized data is
     the same as that in the source documents and has not been
     exposed to accidental or malicious alteration or
     destruction.

Descriptive Top-Level Specification (DTLS) - A top-level
     specification that is written in a natural language (e.g.,
     English), an informal program design notation, or a
     combination of the two.

Discretionary Access Control - A means of restricting access to
     objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to
     which they belong.  The controls are discretionary in the
     sense that a subject with a certain access permission is
     capable of passing that permission (perhaps indirectly) on
     to any other subject.

Domain - The set of objects that a subject has the ability to
     access.

Dominate - Security level S1 is said to dominate security level
     S2 if the hierarchical classification of S1 is greater than
     or equal to that of S2 and the non-hierarchical categories
     of S1 include all those of S2 as a subset.

Exploitable Channel - Any channel that is useable or detectable
     by subjects external to the Trusted Computing Base.

Flaw Hypothesis Methodology - A system analysis and penetration
     technique where specifications and documentation for the
     system are analyzed and then flaws in the system are
     hypothesized.  The list of hypothesized flaws is then
     prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a
     flaw actually exists and, assuming a flaw does exist, on the
     ease of exploiting it and on the extent of control or
     compromise it would provide.  The prioritized list is used
     to direct the actual testing of the system.

Flaw - An error of commission, omission, or oversight in a system
     that allows protection mechanisms to be bypassed.

Formal Proof - A complete and convincing mathematical argument,
     presenting the full logical justification for each proof
     step, for the truth of a theorem or set of theorems.  The
     formal verification process uses formal proofs to show the
     truth of certain properties of formal specification and for
     showing that computer programs satisfy their specifications.

Formal Security Policy Model - A mathematically precise statement
     of a security policy.  To be adequately precise, such a
     model must represent the initial state of a system, the way
     in which the system progresses from one state to another,
     and a definition of a "secure" state of the system.  To be
     acceptable as a basis for a TCB, the model must be supported
     by a formal proof that if the initial state of the system
     satisfies the definition of a "secure" state and if all
     assumptions required by the model hold, then all future
     states of the system will be secure.  Some formal modeling
     techniques include:  state transition models, temporal logic
     models, denotational semantics models, algebraic
     specification models.  An example is the model described by
     Bell and LaPadula in reference [2].  See also:  Bell-
     LaPadula Model, Security Policy Model.

Formal Top-Level Specification (FTLS) - A Top-Level Specification
     that is written in a formal mathematical language to allow
     theorems showing the correspondence of the system
     specification to its formal requirements to be hypothesized
     and formally proven.

Formal Verification - The process of using formal proofs to
     demonstrate the consistency (design verification) between a
     formal specification of a system and a formal security
     policy model or (implementation verification) between the
     formal specification and its program implementation.

Functional Testing - The portion of security testing in which the
     advertised features of a system are tested for correct
     operation.

General-Purpose System - A computer system that is designed to
     aid in solving a wide variety of problems.

Lattice - A partially ordered set for which every pair of
     elements has a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound.

Least Privilege - This principle requires that each subject in a
     system be granted the most restrictive set of privileges (or
     lowest clearance) needed for the performance of authorized
     tasks.  The application of this principle limits the damage
     that can result from accident, error, or unauthorized use.

Mandatory Access Control - A means of restricting access to
     objects based on the sensitivity (as represented by a label)
     of the information contained in the objects and the formal
     authorization (i.e., clearance) of subjects to access
     information of such sensitivity.

Multilevel Device - A device that is used in a manner that
     permits it to simultaneously process data of two or more
     security levels without risk of compromise.  To accomplish
     this, sensitivity labels are normally stored on the same
     physical medium and in the same form (i.e., machine-readable
     or human-readable) as the data being processed.

Multilevel Secure - A class of system containing information with
     different sensitivities that simultaneously permits access
     by users with different security clearances and needs-to-
     know, but prevents users from obtaining access to
     information for which they lack authorization.

Object - A passive entity that contains or receives information.
     Access to an object potentially implies access to the
     information it contains.  Examples of objects are:  records,
     blocks, pages, segments, files, directories, directory
     trees, and programs, as well as bits, bytes, words, fields,
     processors, video displays, keyboards, clocks, printers,
     network nodes, etc.

Object Reuse - The reassignment to some subject of a medium
     (e.g., page frame, disk sector, magnetic tape) that
     contained one or more objects.  To be securely reassigned,
     such media must contain no residual data from the previously
     contained object(s).

Output - Information that has been exported by a TCB.

Password - A private character string that is used to
     authenticate an identity.

Penetration Testing - The portion of security testing in which
     the penetrators attempt to circumvent the security features
     of a system.  The penetrators may be assumed to use all
     system design and implementation documentation, which may
     include listings of system source code, manuals, and circuit
     diagrams.  The penetrators work under no constraints other
     than those that would be applied to ordinary users.

Process - A program in execution.  It is completely characterized
     by a single current execution point (represented by the
     machine state) and address space.

Protection-Critical Portions of the TCB - Those portions of the
     TCB whose normal function is to deal with the control of
     access between subjects and objects.

Protection Philosophy - An informal description of the overall
     design of a system that delineates each of the protection
     mechanisms employed.  A combination (appropriate to the
     evaluation class) of formal and informal techniques is used
     to show that the mechanisms are adequate to enforce the
     security policy.

Read - A fundamental operation that results only in the flow of
     information from an object to a subject.

Read Access - Permission to read information.

Reference Monitor Concept - An access control concept that refers
     to an abstract machine that mediates all accesses to objects
     by subjects.

Resource - Anything used or consumed while performing a function.
     The categories of resources are: time, information, objects
     (information containers), or processors (the ability to use
     information).  Specific examples are: CPU time; terminal
     connect time; amount of directly-addressable memory; disk
     space; number of I/O requests per minute, etc.

Security Kernel - The hardware, firmware, and software elements
     of a Trusted Computing Base that implement the reference
     monitor concept.  It must mediate all accesses, be protected
     from modification, and be verifiable as correct.

Security Level - The combination of a hierarchical classification
     and a set of non-hierarchical categories that represents the
     sensitivity of information.

Security Policy - The set of laws, rules, and practices that
     regulate how an organization manages, protects, and
     distributes sensitive information.

Security Policy Model - An informal presentation of a formal
     security policy model.

Security Testing - A process used to determine that the security
     features of a system are implemented as designed and that
     they are adequate for a proposed application environment.
     This process includes hands-on functional testing,
     penetration testing, and verification.  See also: Functional
     Testing, Penetration Testing, Verification.

Sensitive Information - Information that, as determined by a
     competent authority, must be protected because its
     unauthorized disclosure, alteration, loss, or destruction
     will at least cause perceivable damage to someone or
     something.

Sensitivity Label - A piece of information that represents the
     security level of an object and that describes the
     sensitivity (e.g., classification) of the data in the
     object.   Sensitivity labels are used by the TCB as the basis
     for mandatory access control decisions.

Simple Security Property - A Bell-LaPadula security model rule
     allowing a subject read access to an object only if the
     security level of the subject dominates the security level
     of the object.

Single-Level Device - A device that is used to process data of a
     single security level at any one time.  Since the device
     need not be trusted to separate data of different security
     levels, sensitivity labels do not have to be stored with the
     data being processed.

*-Property (Star Property) - A Bell-LaPadula security model rule
     allowing a subject write access to an object only if the
     security level of the subject is dominated by the security
     level of the object.  Also known as the Confinement
     Property.

Storage Object - An object that supports both read and write
     accesses.

Subject - An active entity, generally in the form of a person,
     process, or device that causes information to flow among
     objects or changes the system state.  Technically, a
     process/domain pair.

Subject Security Level - A subject's security level is equal to
     the security level of the objects to which it has both read
     and write access.  A subject's security level must always be
     dominated by the clearance of the user the subject is
     associated with.

TEMPEST - The study and control of spurious electronic signals
     emitted from ADP equipment.

Top-Level Specification (TLS) - A non-procedural description of
     system behavior at the most abstract level.  Typically a
     functional specification that omits all implementation
     details.

Trap Door - A hidden software or hardware mechanism that permits
     system protection mechanisms to be circumvented.  It is
     activated in some non-apparent manner (e.g., special
     "random" key sequence at a terminal).

Trojan Horse - A computer program with an apparently or actually
     useful function that contains additional (hidden) functions
     that surreptitiously exploit the legitimate authorizations
     of the invoking process to the detriment of security.  For
     example, making a "blind copy" of a sensitive file for the
     creator of the Trojan Horse.

Trusted Computer System - A system that employs sufficient
     hardware and software integrity measures to allow its use
     for processing simultaneously a range of sensitive or
     classified information.

Trusted Computing Base (TCB) - The totality of protection
     mechanisms within a computer system -- including hardware,
     firmware, and software -- the combination of which is
     responsible for enforcing a security policy.  It creates a
     basic protection environment and provides additional user
     services required for a trusted computer system.  The
     ability of a trusted computing base to correctly enforce a
     security policy depends solely on the mechanisms within the
     TCB and on the correct input by system administrative
     personnel of parameters (e.g., a user's clearance) related
     to the security policy.

Trusted Path - A mechanism by which a person at a terminal can
     communicate directly with the Trusted Computing Base.  This
     mechanism can only be activated by the person or the Trusted
     Computing Base and cannot be imitated by untrusted software.

Trusted Software - The software portion of a Trusted Computing
     Base.

User - Any person who interacts directly with a computer system.

Verification - The process of comparing two levels of system
     specification for proper correspondence (e.g., security
     policy model with top-level specification, TLS with source
     code, or source code with object code).  This process may or
     may not be automated.

Write - A fundamental operation that results only in the flow of
     information from a subject to an object.

Write Access - Permission to write an object.

   DoD STANDARD 5200.28:  SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENCES
                          BETWEEN IT AND CSC-STD-001-83


Note: Text which has been added or changed is indented and preceded by > sign.
Text which has been deleted is enclosed in slashes (/).  "Computer Security
Center" was changed to "National Computer Security Center" throughout the
document.

The FOREWORD Section was rewritten and signed by Mr. Don Latham on
26 Dec 85.  The ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Section was updated.

The PREFACE was changed as follows:

                                 PREFACE


The trusted computer system evaluation criteria defined in this
document classify systems into four broad hierarchical divisions
of enhanced security protection.  The criteria provide a basis
for the evaluation of effectiveness of security controls built
into automatic data processing system products.  The criteria
were developed with three objectives in mind:  (a) to provide
users with a yardstick with which to assess the degree of trust
that can be placed in computer systems for the secure processing
of classified or other sensitive information; (b) to provide
guidance to manufacturers as to what to build into their new,
widely-available trusted commercial products in order to satisfy
trust requirements for sensitive applications; and (c) to provide
a basis for specifying security requirements in acquisition
specifications.  Two types of requirements are delineated for
secure processing: (a) specific security feature requirements and
(b) assurance requirements.  Some of the latter requirements
enable evaluation personnel to determine if the required features
are present and functioning as intended.

        >The scope of these criteria is to be applied to
        >the set of components comprising a trusted system, and is
        >not necessarily to be applied to each system component
        >individually.  Hence, some components of a system may be
        >completely untrusted, while others may be individually
        >evaluated to a lower or higher evaluation class than the
        >trusted product considered as a whole system.  In trusted
        >products at the high end of the range, the strength of the
        >reference monitor is such that most of the system
        >components can be completely untrusted.

Though the criteria are

        >intended to be

application-independent, /it is recognized that/ the
specific security feature requirements may have to be
interpreted when applying the criteria to specific

        >systems with their own functional requirements,
        >applications or special environments (e.g., communications
        >processors, process control computers, and embedded systems
        >in general).

The underlying assurance requirements can be
applied across the entire spectrum of ADP system or
application processing environments without special
interpretation.


The SCOPE Section was changed as follows:

Scope

The trusted computer system evaluation criteria defined in this
document apply

        >primarily

to /both/ trusted, commercially available
automatic data processing (ADP) systems.

        >They are also applicable, as amplified below, to the
        >evaluation of existing systems and to the specification of
        >security requirements for ADP systems acquisition.

EXTENDING THE CONSTITUTION TO AMERICAN CYBERSPACE:


TO ESTABLISH CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION FOR ELECTRONIC MEDIA AND TO
OBTAIN REDRESS FOR AN UNLAWFUL SEARCH, SEIZURE, AND PRIOR RESTRAINT
ON PUBLICATION, STEVE JACKSON GAMES AND THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER
FOUNDATION TODAY FILED A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES SECRET
SERVICE AND OTHERS.


        On March 1, 1990, the United States Secret Service nearly
destroyed Steve Jackson Games (SJG), an award-winning publishing
business in Austin, Texas.
        In an early morning raid with an unlawful and
unconstitutional warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a
search of the SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript
being prepared for publication, private electronic mail, and several
computers, including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer
Bulletin Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only
innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.  The
raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that somewhere in
Jackson's office there "might be" a document compromising the
security of the 911 telephone system.
        In the months that followed,
Jackson saw the business he had built up over many years dragged to
the edge of bankruptcy. SJG was a successful and prestigious
publisher of books and other materials used in adventure role-playing
games.  Jackson also operated a computer bulletin board system (BBS)
to communicate with his customers and writers and obtain feedback and
suggestions on new gaming ideas.  The bulletin board was also the
repository of private electronic mail belonging to several of its
users.  This private mail was seized in the raid.  Despite repeated
requests for the return of his manuscripts and equipment, the Secret
Service has refused to comply fully.
        Today, more than a year after that raid, The Electronic
Frontier Foundation, acting with SJG owner Steve Jackson, has filed
a precedent setting civil suit against the
United States Secret Service, Secret Service Agents Timothy Foley and
Barbara Golden, Assistant United States Attorney William Cook, and
Henry Kluepfel.
        "This is the most important case brought to date,"
said EFF general counsel Mike Godwin, "to vindicate the
Constitutional rights of the users of computer-based communications
technology.  It will establish the Constitutional dimension of
electronic expression.  It also will be one of the first cases that
invokes the Electronic Communications and Privacy Act as a shield and
not as a sword -- an act that guarantees users of this digital
medium the same privacy protections enjoyed by those who use the
telephone and the U.S. Mail."
        Commenting on the overall role of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation in this case and other matters, EFFs
president Mitch Kapor said, "We have been acting as an organization
interested in defending the wrongly accused. But the Electronic
Frontier Foundation is also going to be active in establishing
broader principles.  We begin with this case, where the issues are
clear.  But behind this specific action, the EFF also believes that
it is vital that government, private entities, and individuals who
have violated the Constitutional rights of individuals be held
accountable for their actions. We also hope this case will help
demystify the world of computer users to the general public and
inform them about the potential of computer communities."

Foundation in this suit is James George,Jr. of Graves, Dougherty,

WHY THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION IS BRINGING SUIT ON BEHALF OF
STEVE JACKSON.


        With this case, the Electronic Frontier Foundation begins a new
phase of affirmative legal action. We intend to fight for broad
Constitutional protection for operators and users of computer
bulletin boards.

        It is essential to establish the principle that computer bulletin
boards  and computer conferencing systems are entitled to the same
First Amendment rights enjoyed by other media.  It is also critical
to establish that operators of bulletin boards JQJ whether
individuals or businesses JQJ are not subject to unconstitutional,
overbroad searches and seizures of any of the contents of their
systems, including electronic mail.

        The Electronic Frontier Foundation also believes that
it is vital to hold government, private entities, and individuals
who have violated the Constitutional rights of others accountable
for their actions.

LEGAL FACT SHEET: STEVE JACKSON GAMES V.  UNITED STATES SECRET
SERVICE, ET AL


This lawsuit seeks to vindicate the rights of a small, successful
entrepreneur/publisher to conduct its entirely lawful business, free
of unjustified governmental interference.  It is also the goal of
this litigation to firmly establish the principle that lawful
activities carried out with the aid of computer technology, including
computer communications and publishing, are entitled to the same
constitutional protections that have long been accorded to the print
medium. Computers and modems, no less than printing presses,
typewriters, the mail, and telephones -being the methods selected by
Americans to communicate with one another -- are all protected by our
constitutional rights.


Factual Background and Parties:

Steve Jackson, of Austin, Texas, is a successful small businessman.
His company, Steve Jackson Games, is an award- winning publisher of
adventure games and related books and magazines.  In addition to its
books and magazines, SJG operates an electronic bulletin board system
(the Illuminati BBS) for its customers and for others interested in
adventure games and related literary genres.

Also named as plaintiffs are various users of the Illuminati BBS.
The professional interests of these users range from writing to
computer technology.

Although neither Jackson nor
his company were suspected of any criminal activity, the company was
rendered a near fatal blow on March 1, 1990, when agents of the
United States Secret Service, aided by other law enforcement
officials, raided its office, seizing computer equipment necessary to
the operation of its publishing business.  The government seized the
Illuminati BBS and all of the communications stored on it, including
private electronic mail, shutting down the BBS for over a month.  The
Secret Service also seized publications protected by the First
Amendment, including drafts of the about-to-be-released role playing
game book GURPS Cyberpunk.  The publication of the book was
substantially delayed while SJG employees rewrote it from older
drafts.  This fantasy game book, which one agent preposterously
called "a handbook for computer crime," has since sold over 16,000
copies and been nominated for a prestigious game industry award.  No
evidence of criminal activity was found.

The warrant application,
which remained sealed at the government's request for seven months,
reveals that the agents were investigating an employee of the company
whom they believed to be engaged in activity they found questionable
at his home and on his own time.  The warrant application further
reveals not only that the Secret Service had no reason to think any
evidence of criminal activity would be found at SJG, but also that
the government omitted telling the Magistrate who issued the warrant
that SJG was a publisher and that the contemplated raid would cause a
prior restraint on constitutionally protected speech, publication,
and association.

The defendants in this case are the United States
Secret Service and the individuals who, by planning and carrying out
this grossly illegal search and seizure, abused the power conferred
upon them by the federal government. Those individuals include
Assistant United States Attorney William J. Cook, Secret Service
Agents Timothy M. Foley and Barbara Golden, as well Henry M. Kluepfel
of Bellcore, who actively participated in the unlawful activities as
an agent of the federal government.

These defendants are the same
individuals and entities responsible for the prosecution last year of
electronic publisher Craig Neidorf.  The government in that case
charged that Neidorf's publication of materials concerning the
enhanced 911 system constituted interstate transportation of stolen
property.  The prosecution was resolved in Neidorf's favor in July of
1990 when Neidorf demonstrated that materials he published were
generally available to the public.


Legal Significance:


This case is about the constitutional and statutory rights of
publishers who conduct their activities in electronic media rather
than in the traditional print and hard copy media, as well as the
rights of individuals and companies that use computer technology to
communicate as well as to conduct personal and business affairs
generally.

The government's wholly unjustified raid on SJG, and
seizure of its books, magazines, and BBS, violated clearly
established statutory and constitutional law, including:


.    The Privacy Protection Act of 1980, which generally prohibits
the government from searching the offices of publishers for work
product and other documents, including materials that are
electronically stored;


.    The First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, which guarantees
freedom of speech, of the press and of association, and which
prohibits the government from censoring publications, whether in
printed or electronic media.


.    The Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable governmental
searches and seizures, including both general searches and searches
conducted without probable cause to believe that specific evidence of
criminal activity will be found at the location searched.


.    The Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Federal
Wiretap statute, which together prohibit the government from seizing
electronic communications without justification and proper
authorization.

COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
I.  INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
     This is a civil action for damages to redress
violations of the Privacy Protection Act of 1980,
42 U.S.C.  2000aa et seq; the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, as amended, 18 U.S.C.
2510 et seq and 2701 et seq; and the First and
Fourth Amendments to the United States
Constitution.
     Plaintiffs are Steve Jackson Games
Incorporated ("SJG"), an award-winning publisher of
books, magazines, and games; its president and sole
owner Steve Jackson; and three other users of an
electronic bulletin board system operated by SJG.
        Defendants are the United States Secret
Service, the United States of America, an Assistant
United States Attorney, Secret Service agents, and
a private individual who acted at the direction of
these federal officers and agents and under color
of federal authority.
     Although neither Steve Jackson nor SJG was a
target of any criminal investigation, defendants
caused a general search of the business premises of
SJG and the wholesale seizure, retention, and
conversion of computer hardware and software and
all data and communications stored there.
Defendants seized and retained work product and
documentary materials relating to SJG books, games,
and magazines, thereby imposing a prior restraint
on the publication of such materials.  Defendants
also seized and retained an entire electronic
bulletin board system, including all computer
hardware and software used to operate the system
and all data and communications stored on the
system, causing a prior restraint on the operation
of the system.  Defendants also seized and retained
computer hardware and software, proprietary
information, records, and communications used by
SJG in the ordinary course of operating its
publishing business.
     The search of this reputable publishing
business and resulting seizures constituted a
blatant violation of clearly established law.  The
search and seizure violated the Privacy Protection
Act of 1980, which strictly prohibits law
enforcement officers from using search and seizure
procedures to obtain work product or documentary
materials from a publisher, except in narrow
circumstances not applicable here.  The seizure and
retention of SJG's work product and bulletin board
system, as well as the seizure and retentionof the
computers used to prepare SJG publications and to
operate the bulletin board system, violated the
First Amendment.  The search and seizure, which
encompassed proprietary business information and
private electronic communications as well as
materials protected by the First Amendment, also
violated the Fourth Amendment.  Defendants
conducted an unconstitutional general search
pursuant to a facially invalid, general warrant.
The warrant was issued without probable cause to
believe that any evidence of criminal activity
would be found at SJG and was issued on the basis
of false and misleading information supplied by the
defendants.  Defendants also invaded plaintiffs'
privacy by seizing and intercepting the plaintiffs'
private electronic communications in violation of
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
        Defendants' wrongful and unlawful conduct
amounted to an assault by the government on the
plaintiffs, depriving them of their property, their
privacy, their First Amendment rights and
inflicting humiliation and great emotional distress
upon them.
II.  DEFINITIONS
     When used in this complaint, the following
words and phrases have the following meanings:
        Computer Hardware: Computer hardware consists
of the mechanical, magnetic, electronic, and
electrical devices making up a computer system,
such as the central processing unit, computer
storage devices (disk drives, hard disks, floppy
disks), keyboard, monitor, and printing devices.
        Computer Software: Computer software consists
of computer programs and related instructions and
documentation.
        Computer Program:  A computer program is a set
of instructions that, when executed on a computer,
cause the computer to process data.
        Source Code: Source code is a set of
instructions written in computer programming
language readable by humans.  Source code must be
"compiled," "assembled," or "interpreted" with the
use of a computer program before it is executable
by a computer.
        Text File:  A computer file is a collection of
data treated as a unit by a computer.  A text file
is a memorandum, letter, or any other alphanumeric
text treated as a unit by a computer.  A text file
can be retrieved from storage and viewed on a
computer monitor, printed on paper by a printer
compatible with the computer storing the data, or
transmitted to another computer.
        Modem: A modem, or modulator-demodulator, is
an electronic device that makes possible the
transmission of data to or from a computer over
communications channels, including telephone lines.
     Electronic mail: Electronic mail (e-mail) is a
data communication transmitted between users of a
computer system or network.  E-mail is addressed to
one or more accounts on a computer system assigned
to specific users and is typically stored on the
system computer until read and deleted by the
addressee.  The privacy of electronic mail is
typically secured by means of a password, so that
only individuals withknowledge of the account's
password can obtain access to mail sent to that
account.
     Electronic Bulletin Board System (BBS):  A BBS
is a computerized conferencing system that permits
communication and association between and among its
users.  A systems operator ("sysop") manages the
BBS on a computer system that is equipped with
appropriate hardware and software to store text
files and communications and make them accessible
to users.   Users of the BBS gain access to the
system using their own computers and modems and
normal telephone lines.
     A BBS is similar to a traditional bulletin
board in that it allows users to transmit and
"post" information readable by other users.  Common
features of a BBS include:
   (1) Conferences in which users engage in an
ongoing exchange of information and ideas.
Conferences can be limited to a specific group of
users, creating an expectation of privacy, or open
to the general public.
   (2) Archives containing electronically stored
text files accessible to users;
   (3) Electronic mail service, in which the host
computer facilitates the delivery, receipt, and
storage of electronic mail sent between users.
     Bulletin board systems may be maintained as
private systems or permit access to the general
public.  They range in size from small systems
operated by individuals using personal computers in
their homes, to medium-sized systemsoperated by
groups or commercial organizations, to world-wide
networks of interconnected computers.  The subject
matter and number of topics discussed on a BBS are
limited only by the choices of the system's
operators and users.  Industry estimates indicate
that well over a million people in the United
States use bulletin board systems.

IV.  STATEMENT OF CLAIMS
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Steve Jackson Games
     11.  SJG, established in 1980 and incorporated
in 1984, is a publisher of books, magazines, and
adventure games.
   (a) SJG books and games create imaginary worlds
whose settings range from prehistoric to futuristic
times and whose form encompass various literary
genres.
   (b) The magazines published by SJG contain news,
information, and entertainment relating to the
adventure game industry and related literary
genres.
     12.  SJG games and publications are carried by
wholesale distributors throughout the United States
and abroad.
     13.  SJG books are sold by national retail
chain stores including B. Dalton, Bookstop, and
Waldenbooks.
     14.  Each year from 1981 through 1989, and
again in 1991, SJG board games, game books, and/or
magazines have been nominated for and/or received
the Origins Award.  The Origins Award, administered
by the Game Manufacturers' Association, is the
adventure game industry's most prestigious award.
     15.  SJG is not, and has never been, in the
business of selling computer games, computer
programs, or other computer products.
     16.  On March 1, 1990, SJG had 17 employees.
Steve Jackson Games Computer Use
     17.  At all relevant times, SJG relied upon
computers for many aspects of its business,
including but not limited to the following uses:
   (a) Like other publishers of books or magazines,
and like a newspaper publisher, SJG used computers
to compose, store, and prepare for publication the
text of its books, magazines, and games.
   (b) SJG stored notes, source materials, and
other work product and documentary materials
relating to SJG publications on its computers.
   (c) Like many businesses, SJG used computers to
create and store business records including, but
not limited to, correspondence, contracts, address
directories, budgetary and payroll information,
personnel information, and correspondence.
     18.  Since 1986, SJG has used a computer to
operate an electronic bulletin board system (BBS)
dedicated to communication of information about
adventure games, the game industry, related
literary genres, and to association among
individuals who share these interests.
   (a) The BBS was named "Illuminati," after the
company's award-winning board game.
   (b) At all relevant times, the Illuminati BBS
was operated by means of a computer located on the
business premises of SJG.  The computer used to run
the Illuminati BBS (hereafter the "Illuminati
computer") was connected to the telephone number
512-447-4449.  Users obtained access to
communications and information stored on the
Illuminati BBS from their own computers via
telephone lines.
   (c) The Illuminati BBS provided a forum for
communication and association among its users,
which included SJG employees, customers, retailers,
writers, artists, competitors, writers of science
fiction and fantasy, and others with an interest in
the adventure game industry or related literary
genres.
   (d) SJG, Jackson, and SJG employees also used
the Illuminati BBS in the course of business to
communicate with customers, retailers, writers, and
artists; to provide customer service; to obtain
feedback on games and new game ideas; to obtain
general marketing information; to advertise its
games and publications, and to establish good will
and a sense of community with others who shared
common interests.
   (e) As of February 1990, the Illuminati BBS had
over 300 users residing throughout the United
States and abroad.
   (f) At all relevant times, plaintiffs SJG,
Jackson, McCoy, Milliken, and O'Sullivan were
active users of the Illuminati BBS.

secure the privacy of the account.
   (h) The Illuminati BBS gave users access to
general files of electronically stored information.
General files included, but were not limited to,
text files containing articles on adventure games
and game-related humor, including articles
published in SJG magazines and articles contributed
by users of the BBS, and text files containing game
rules.  These general files were stored on the
Illuminati computer at SJG.
   (i) The Illuminati BBS provided several public
conferences, in which users of the BBS could post
information readable by other users and read
information posted by others.  The discussions in
the public conferences focused on SJG products,
publications and related literary genres. All
communications transmitted to these conferences
were stored in the Illuminati computer at SJG.
   (j) SJG informed users of the Illuminati BBS
that

"any opinions expressed on the BBS, unless
specifically identified as the opinions or policy
of Steve Jackson Games Incorporated, are only those
of the person posting them.  SJ Games will do its
best to remove any false, harmful or otherwise
obnoxious material posted, but accepts no
responsibility for material placed on this board
without its knowledge.
   (k) The Illuminati BBS also provided private
conferences that were accessible only to certain
users authorized by SJG and not to the general
public.  All communications transmitted to these
conferences were stored in the Illuminati computer
at SJG.
   (l)  The Illuminati BBS provided a private
electronic mail (e-mail) service, which permitted
the transmission of private communications between
users on the system as follows:
   (i) E-mail transmitted to an account on the
Illuminati BBS was stored on the BBS computer until
deleted by the addressee.
   (ii) The privacy of e-mail was secured by the
use of passwords.
   (iii) The privacy of e-mail was also secured by
computer software that prevented the system
operator from reading e-mail inadvertently.
   (iv) The privacy of e-mail was also secured by
SJG policy.  SJG informed users of the Illuminati
BBS that "[e]lectronic mail is private."
   (v) As a matter of policy, practice, and
customer expectations, SJG did not read e-mail
addressed to Illuminati users other than SJG.
   (vi) At all relevant times, all plaintiffs used
the e-mail service on the Illuminati BBS.
   (vii) On March 1, 1990, the Illuminati computer
contained stored e-mail sent to or from each of the
plaintiffs.
The Illegal Warrant and Application
     19.  On February 28, 1990, defendant Foley
filed an application with this Court, for a warrant
authorizing the search of the business premises of
SJG and seizure of "[c]omputer hardware (including,
but not limited to, central processing unit(s),
monitors, memory devices, modem(s), programming
equipment, communication equipment, disks, and
prints) and computer software (including, but not
limited to, memory disks, floppy disks, storage
media) and written material and documents relating
to the use of the computer system (including
networking access files), documentation relating to
the attacking of computers and advertising the
results of computer attacks (including telephone
numbers and location information), and financial
documents and licensing documentation relative to
the computer programs and equipment at the business
known as Steve Jackson Games which constitute
evidence, instrumentalities and fruits of federal
crimes, including interstate transportation of
stolen property (18 USC 2314) and interstate
transportation of computer access information (18
USC 1030(a)(6)).  This warrant is for the seizure
of the above described computer and computer data
and for the authorization to read information
stored and contained on the above described
computer and computer data."
A copy of the application and supporting affidavit
of defendant Foley (hereafter "Foley affidavit")
are attached as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein
by reference.
     20.  The search warrant was sought as part of
an investigation being conducted jointly by
defendant Cook and the United States Attorney's
office in Chicago; defendants Foley, Golden, and
the Chicago field office of the United States
Secret Service; and defendant Kluepfel.
     21.  On information and belief, neither SJG
nor Jackson nor any of the plaintiffs were targets
of this investigation.
     22.  The Foley affidavit was based on the
investigation of defendant Foley and on information
and investigative assistance provided to him by
others, including defendants Golden and Kluepfel
and unnamed agents of the United States Secret
Service.  Foley Affidavit para. 3.
     23.  The Foley affidavit alleged that
defendant Klu%p}el had participated in the
execution of numerous federal and state search
warrants.  Id.
     24.  On information and belief, Defendant Cook
participated in the drafting, review, and
submission of the warrant application and
supporting affidavit to this Court.
     25.  The warrant application and supporting
affidavit were placed under seal on motion of the
United States.
     26.  On February 28, 1990, based on the Foley
affidavit, a United States Magistrate for the
Western District of Texas granted defendant Foley's
warrant application and issued awarrant authorizing
the requested search and seizure described in
paragraph 19 above.  A copy of the search warrant
is attached as Exhibit B.
     27.  The warrant was facially invalid for the
following reasons:
   (a)  It was a general warrant that failed to
describe the place to be searched with
particularity.
   (b)  It was a general warrant that failed to
describe things to be seized with particularity.
   (c) It swept within its scope handwritten,
typed, printed, and electronically stored
communications, work product, documents, and
publications protected by the First Amendment.
   (d) It swept within its scope SJG proprietary
information and business records relating to
activities protected by the First Amendment.
   (e) It swept within its scope a BBS that was a
forum for speech and association protected by the
First Amendment.
   (f) It swept within its scope computer hardware
and software that were used by SJG to publish
books, magazines, and games.
   (g) It swept within its scope computer hardware
and software used by SJG to operate a BBS.
     28.  The warrant was also invalid in that it
authorized the seizure of work product and
documentary materials from apublisher "reasonably
believed to have a purpose to disseminate to the
public a newspaper, book, broadcast, or other
similar form of public communication, in or
affecting interstate or foreign commerce," which is
generally prohibited by 42 U.S.C.  2000aa(a) and
(b), without showing the existence of any of the
narrow statutory exceptions in which such a search
and seizure is permitted.  Specifically, the Foley
affidavit did not establish the existence of any of
the following circumstances:
   (a) The Foley affidavit did not establish
probable cause to believe that SJG, or any employee
in possession of work product materials at SJG, had
committed or was committing a criminal offense to
which such materials related.
   (b) The Foley affidavit did not establish
probable cause to believe that SJG or any employee
of SJG in possession of work product materials at
SJG, had committed or was committing a criminal
offense to which such materials related consisting
of other than the receipt possession,
communication, or withholding of such materials or
the information contained therein.
   (c) The Foley affidavit did not establish
probable cause to believe that SJG, or any employee
of SJG in possession of work product materials at
SJG, had committed or was committing a criminal
offense consisting of the receipt, possession, or
communicationof information relating to the
national defense, classified information, or
restricted data under the provisions of 18 U.S.C.
793, 794, 797, or 798 or 50 U.S.C.  783.
   (d) The Foley affidavit did not establish reason
to believe that immediate seizure of work product
materials from SJG was necessary to prevent the
death of, or serious bodily injury to, a human
being.
   (e) The Foley affidavit did not establish
probable cause to believe that SJG, or any employee
of SJG in possession of documentary materials at
SJG, had committed or was committing a criminal
offense to which the materials related.
   (f)  The Foley affidavit did not establish
probable cause to believe that SJG, or any employee
of SJG in possession of documentary materials at
SJG had committed or was committing a criminal
offense to which the materials related consisting
of other than the receipt, possession,
communication, or withholding of such materials or
the information contained therein.
   (g)  The Foley affidavit did not establish
probable cause to believe that SJG, or any employee
of SJG in possession of documentary materials at
SJG, had committed or was committing an offense
consisting of the receipt, possession, or
communication of information relating to the
national defense, classifiedinformation, or
restricted data under the provisions of 18 U.S.C.
793, 794, 797, or 798 or 50 U.S.C.  783.
   (h)  The Foley affidavit did not establish
reason to believe that the immediate seizure of
such documentary materials was necessary to prevent
the death of, or serious bodily injury to, a human
being.
   (i)  The Foley affidavit did not establish
reason to believe that the giving of notice
pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum would result in
the destruction, alteration, or concealment of such
documentary materials.
   (j)  The Foley affidavit did not establish that
such documentary materials had not been produced in
response to a court order directing compliance with
a subpoena duces tecum and that all appellate
remedies had been exhausted or that there was
reason to believe that the delay in an
investigation or trial occasioned by further
proceedings relating to the subpoena would threaten
the interests of justice.
     29.  The warrant was invalid because the
warrant application and supporting affidavit of
defendant Foley did not establish probable cause to
believe that the business premises of SJG was a
place where evidence of criminal activity would be
found, in that:
   (a) The Foley affidavit did not allege that
evidence of criminal activity would be found at
SJG.  Rather, the affidavit alleged that "E911
source code and text file"and a "decryption
software program" would be "found in the computers
located at 1517G Summerstone, Austin, Texas, or at
2700-A Metcalfe  Road, Austin, Texas [SJG], or at
3524 Graystone #192, or in the computers at each of
those locations."  Foley Affidavit para. 30
(emphasis added).
   (b) The Foley affidavit did not establish
probable cause to believe that E911 source code
would be found at the business premises of SJG.
   (c) The Foley affidavit did not establish
probable cause to believe that an E911 text file
would be found at the business premises of SJG.
   (d) The Foley affidavit did not establish
probable cause to believe that a decryption
software program would be found at the business
premises of SJG.
     30.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the warrant
affidavit demonstrated probable cause to believe
that "E911 source code and text file" and a
"password decryption program" would be found at the
business premises of SJG, the warrant was still
invalid because its description of items to be
seized was broader than any probable cause shown,
in that:
   (a) The warrant authorized the seizure of
computer hardware, software, and documentation that
did not constitute evidence, instrumentalities, or
fruits of criminal activity;
   (b) The warrant authorized the seizure and
reading of electronically stored data, including
publications, work product, proprietary
information, business records, personnel records,
and correspondence, that did not constitute
evidence, instrumentalities, or fruits of criminal
activity;
   (c) The warrant authorized the seizure and
reading of electronically stored communications
that were not accessible to the public, including
private electronic mail, and that did not
constitute evidence, instrumentalities, or fruits
of criminal activity.
     31.  The warrant is invalid because there is
nothing in the Foley affidavit to show that the
information provided by defendant Kluepfel
regarding the BBS at SJG was not stale.
     32.  The warrant was invalid because the Foley
affidavit was materially false and misleading, and
because defendants submitted it knowing it was
false and misleading or with reckless disregard for
the truth, as set forth in paragraphs 33-40 below.
     33.  The Foley affidavit did not inform the
Magistrate that SJG was a publisher of games,
books, and magazines, engaged in the business of
preparing such materials for public dissemination
in or affecting interstate commerce;
   (a) This omission was material;
   (b) Defendants omitted this material information
>from the warrant application knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the
application.
     34.  The Foley affidavit did not inform the
Magistrate that SJG used computers to compose and
prepare publications for public dissemination;
   (a) This omission was material;
   (b) Defendants omitted this material information
>from the warrant application knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the
application.
     35.  The Foley affidavit did not inform the
Magistrate that the computer at SJG used to operate
the BBS contained electronically stored texts, work
product, documentary materials, and communications
stored for the purpose of public dissemination in
or affecting interstate commerce;
   (a) This omission was material;
   (b) Defendants omitted this material information
>from the warrant application knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the
application.
     36.  The Foley affidavit did not inform the
Magistrate that a computer used to operate the BBS
at SJG operated a forum for constitutionally
protected speech and association regarding
adventure games and related literary genres;
   (a) This omission was material;
   (b) Defendants omitted this material information
>from the warrant application knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the
application.
     37.  The Foley affidavit did not inform the
Magistrate that the computer used to operate the
BBS at SJG contained stored private electronic
communications;
   (a) This omission was material;
   (b) Defendants omitted this material information
>from the warrant application knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the
application.
     38.  The Foley affidavit falsely alleged that
the E911 text file was a "program." Foley Affidavit
paras. 8, 14, 17;      (a) This false allegation
was material;
   (b) Defendants made this material false
allegation knowingly or with reckless disregard for
its truth or falsity;
   (c) Defendants Cook and Foley have acknowledged
that the E911 text file is not a program.
        39.  The affidavit of defendant Foley falsely
alleges that the information in the E911 text file
was "highly proprietary" and "sensitive".  Foley
Affidavit paras. 13, 14, 22;
   (a) This false allegation was material;
   (b) Defendants made this material false
allegation knowingly or with reckless disregard for
its truth or falsity;
   (c) Defendant Cook has acknowledged that much of
the information in the E911 text file had been
disclosed to the public.
     40.  The affidavit of defendant Foley falsely
alleges that the E911 text file was "worth
approximately $79,000.00," para. 4, and "engineered
at a cost of $79,449.00," para. 14;
   (a)  This false allegation was material;
   (b) Defendants made this material false
allegation knowingly or with reckless disregard for
its truth or falsity;
   (c) Defendant Cook has acknowledged that the
value of the nondisclosed information in the E911
text file was less than the $5000.00 jurisdictional
minimum for Interstate Transportation of Stolen
Property, 18 U.S.C.  2314.
        41.  Reasonable persons in defendants'
position would have known that the warrant was
invalid for the reasons given in paragraphs 27-40
and would not have requested or relied on the
warrant.The Search and Seizure:
     42.  Nevertheless, on March 1, 1990, defendant
Golden, other agents of the United States Secret
Service, and others acting in concert with them,
conducted a general search of the SJG office and
warehouse.
     43.  The searching officers prevented SJG
employees from entering their workplace or
conducting any business from 8:00 a.m. until after
1:00 p.m. on March 1, 1990.
     44.  The agents seized computer hardware and
related documentation, including, but not limited
to, the following:
(a) three central processing units;
     (b) hard drives;
     (c) hundreds of disks;
     (d  2 monitors;
     (e) 3 keyboards;
     (f) 3 modems;
     (g) a printer;
(h) electrical equipment including, but not limited
to, extension cords, cables, and adapters;
     (i) screws, nuts, and other small parts.
     45.  The agents seized all computer hardware,
computer software, and supporting documentation
used by SJG to run the Illuminati BBS, thereby
causing the following to occur:
   (a) the seizure of all programs, text files, and
public communications stored on the BBS computer;
   (b) the seizure of all private electronic
communications stored on the system, including
electronic mail;
   (c) preventing plaintiffs from operating and
using the BBS.
     46.  The agents seized computer software and
supporting documentation that SJG used in the
ordinary course of its business including, but not
limited to, word processing software.
     47.  The defendants seized all data stored on
the seized SJG computers and disks, including, but
not limited to, the following:
   (a) SJG work product, including drafts of
forthcoming publications and games;
   (b) Communications from customers and others
regarding SJG's games, books, and magazines;
   (c) SJG financial projections;
   (d) SJG contracts;
   (e) SJG correspondence;
   (f) SJG editorial manual, containing
instructions and procedures for writers and
editors;
   (g) SJG address directories, contacts lists, and
employee information, including the home telephone
numbers of SJG employees.
     48.  The defendants seized all current drafts
--  both electronically stored copies and printed
("hard") copies -- of the book GURPS Cyberpunk,
which was scheduled to go to the printer later that
week.
   (a) GURPS Cyberpunk was part of a series of
fantasy roleplaying game books published by SJG
called the Generic Universal Roleplaying System.
   (b) The term "Cyberpunk" refers to a science
fiction literary genre which became popular in the
1980s.  The Cyberpunk genre is characterized by the
fictional interaction of humans with technology and
the fictional struggle for power between
individuals, corporations, and government.  One of
the most popular examples of the Cyberpunk genre is
William Gibson's critically acclaimed science
fiction novel Neuromancer, which was published in
1984.
   (c) GURPS Cyberpunk is a fantasy roleplaying
game book of the Cyberpunk genre.
   (d) SJG eventually published the book GURPS
Cyberpunk in 1990.
   (e) The book has been distributed both
nationally and internationally.
   (f) To date SJG has sold over 16,000 copies of
the book.
   (g) The book has been nominated for an Origins
Award for Best Roleplaying Supplement.
   (h) The book is used in at least one college
literature course as an example of the Cyberpunk
genre.
     49.  The search and seizure exceeded the scope
of the warrant, in that the searching officers
seized computer hardware, computer software, data,
documentation, work product, and correspondence
that did not constitute evidence, instrumentalities
or fruits of any crime.
     50.  The search was conducted in a reckless
and destructive fashion, in that the searching
officers caused damage to SJG property and left the
SJG office and warehouse in disarray.
Post-seizure Retention of Property
     51.  Plaintiffs Jackson and SJG put defendants
on immediate notice that they had seized the
current drafts of the about-to-be-published book
GURPS Cyberpunk and the computer hardware and
software necessary to operate a BBS and requested
immediate return of these materials.
     52.  SJG and Jackson made diligent efforts to
obtain the return of the seized equipment and data,
including but not limited to, retention of legal
counsel, numerous telephone calls to defendants
Cook and Foley by Jackson and SJG counsel, a trip
to the Austin Secret Service office, and
correspondence with defendants Cook and Foley and
with other federal officials.
     53.  On March 2, 1990, Jackson went to the
Austin office of the Secret Service in an
unsuccessful attempt to obtain the return of seized
documents and computer data, including the drafts
of the forthcoming book GURPS Cyberpunk and the
software and files stored on the Illuminati BBS.
     54.  On March 2, 1990, the Secret Service
refused to provide Jackson with the files
containing current drafts of GURPS Cyberpunk, one
agent calling the book a "handbook for computer
crime."
     55.  On March 2, 1990, the Secret Service also
refused to return copies of the software used to
run the Illuminati BBS and copies of any of the
data or communications stored on the BBS.
     56.  In the months following the seizure,
defendant Cook repeatedly gave Jackson and his
counsel false assurances that the property of SJG
would be returned within days.
     57.  In May of 1990, Jackson wrote to Senators
Philip Gramm and Lloyd Bentsen and Congressman J.
J. Pickle, regarding the search and seizure
conducted at SJG and requesting their assistance in
obtaining the return of SJG property.
     58.  On June 21, 1990, the Secret Service
returned most, but not all, of the computer
equipment that had been seized from SJG over three
months earlier.
     59.  The Secret Service did not return some of
SJG's hardware and data.
     60.  The Secret Service did not return any of
the printed drafts of GURPS Cyberpunk.
     61.  In July 3, 1990, letters to Senator
Bentsen and Congressman J. J. Pickle, Robert R.
Snow of the United States Secret Service falsely
stated that all of the items seized from SJG had
been returned to Jackson.
     62.  In his July 16, 1990, letter to Senator
Gramm, Bryce L. Harlow of the United States
Department of Treasuryfalsely stated that all of
the items seized from SJG had been returned to
Jackson.
     63.  Through counsel, SJG wrote to defendant
Foley on July 13, 1990, requesting, inter alia, a
copy of the application for the search warrant and
return of the property the government had not
returned.  A copy of this letter was mailed to
Defendant Cook.  Though the letter requested a
response by August 1, 1990, neither defendant
responded.
     64.  Through counsel, plaintiff SJG again
wrote to defendant Cook on August 8, 1990,
requesting, inter alia, a copy of the application
for the search warrant and return of the property
the government had not returned.  Copies of this
letter were sent to other Assistant United States
Attorneys in Chicago, namely Thomas Durkin, Dean
Polales, and Michael Shepard.
     65.  Defendant Cook responded to this request
with an unsigned letter dated August 10, 1990.  The
letter enclosed a number of documents that had not
previously been returned to SJG.  The letter
further stated that "the application for the search
warrant is under seal with the United States
District Court in Texas since it contains
information relating to an ongoing federal
investigation."
     66.  On September 17, 1990, the warrant
affidavit was unsealed by the United States
Magistrate for the Western District of Texas on the
motion of the United States Attorney for the
Northern District of Illinois.
     67.  The United States Attorney's office did
not provide Jackson, SJG or their counsel with
notice of its motion to unseal the warrant
affidavit or of this Court's order granting its
motion.
Prior Restraint on Publication and Other Damages:
     68.  Defendants' seizure and retention of the
computer hardware and software used to operate the
Illuminati BBS prevented and interfered with
plaintiffs' operation and use of the Illuminati
BBS, including the following:
   (a) In an attempt to minimize the damage caused
by defendants' conduct, SJG purchased replacement
computer hardware and software to operate the
Illuminati BBS;

   (f) Some of the data previously available to
users of the Illuminati BBS was lost or destroyed.
     69.  Defendants' conduct caused a prior
restraint of the publication of the book GURPS
Cyberpunk, in that:
   (a) On March 1, 1990, the book GURPS Cyberpunk
was nearly completed and scheduled to be sent to
the printer the following week;
   (b) On March 1, 1990, defendants caused the
illegal seizure of all of the current drafts of
GURPS Cyberpunk, including both printed drafts and
electronically stored drafts.
   (c) On March 1, 1990, Defendants caused the
illegal seizure of electronic communications stored
on the Illuminati BBS containing comments on GURPS
Cyberpunk.
   (d) Defendants unreasonably refused for weeks to
return the electronically stored drafts of GURPS
Cyberpunk.
   (e) Defendants have not yet returned the printed
drafts of GURPS Cyberpunk.
   (f) Defendants refused to return electronically
stored comments regarding GURPS Cyberpunk for over
three months.
   (g) By their conduct, defendants prevented SJG
>from delivering GURPS Cyberpunk to the printer on
schedule, and caused SJG to miss its publication
deadline.
   (h) As a result of defendants' conduct, and in
an attempt to minimize damages, SJG and its
employeesreconstructed and rewrote GURPS Cyberpunk
>from older drafts.
   (i) As a result of defendants' conduct, the
publication of GURPS Cyberpunk was delayed for six
weeks.
     70.  Defendants' conduct caused substantial
delay in the publication and delivery of other SJG
publications.
     71.  As a result of defendants' conduct, SJG
suffered substantial financial harm including, but
not limited to, lost sales, lost credit lines,
interest on loans, late payment penalties, and
attorney's fees and costs.
     72.  As a result of defendants' conduct, SJG
was forced to lay off 8 of its 17 employees.
     73.  As a result of defendants' conduct, SJG
suffered damage to its business reputation.
     74.  As a result of defendants' conduct, SJG
has suffered loss of, damage to, and conversion of
computer equipment and data, including, but not
limited to, the following:
     (a) loss of and damage to computer hardware;
     (b) loss and destruction of seized data;
75.  Defendants have retained copies of data seized
>from SJG.
     76.  As a result of defendants' conduct,
plaintiff Steve Jackson has suffered additional
harm including, but not limited to, lost income,
damage to professional reputation,humiliation,
invasion of privacy, deprivation of constitutional
rights, and emotional distress.
     77.  As a result of defendants' conduct,
plaintiffs McCoy, Milliken, and O'Sullivan have
suffered additional harm including, but not limited
to, damages resulting from the seizure of their
private electronic mail and the interference with,
and temporary shut down of, the Illuminati forum
for speech and association, deprivation of their
constitutional rights, invasion of their privacy,
and emotional distress.

 Hello, welcome to the new issue NIA071.  This issue was primarily to put out
things that do not go anywhere else.  It is a collection of some text that
would not normaly fit into a normal issue.

  We realize it has been quite some time between NIA070 and NIA071, we do
remind you that NIA is released on a non-scheduled basis.  Rather, it is
released when we have enough material for a new issue.  On that note, please
share what you have with the rest of the community.  Submissions go to
elisem@nuchat.sccsi.com

 We have received a lot of attention regarding Sir Hackalot's article in the
previous release.  We appreciate your comments, but let us remind you that
we are editors, not censors.  This file contained information useful not
only to the underground community but also to system administrators, operators
and users about general unix security.  If this file was presented in an
offensive manner, than excuse us.  It was not meant to please everybody.

 In releasing issue 70, a problem with our maillist occured.  We apologize
for anyone who was inconvenienced by this.  The problem has been fixed.

 Look for the new NIA072 coming out within the next month, it will be a
very informative issue.  Also to add to this note, Phrack will be releasing
(hopefully) an issue in late May.  To EFF, the best of luck in your case
against the SS.  A final note, Doctor Dissector has officially retired but
can be reached at doctord@darkside.com

 Submissions, questions, comments and subscriptions can be mailed to
elisem@nuchat.sccsi.com.  Our files can be found on Ripco BBS and the
CuD archive server (Ref: CuD Newsletter).
