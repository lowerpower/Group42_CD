This FAQ contains information about hacking Novell Netware. It
is intented to show what and how regarding hacking on Netware,
and by illustrating this in explicit detail show how sys admins
can improve security and prevent break-ins.
<P>
Most of the information in this FAQ was compiled and collected
from various sources freely available on the Internet. In fact,
most of the information here is OLD info for serious Netware hackers.
Some of the info was collected from these serious Netware hackers,

sweeps that I have been involved in.

You will also find hints and generally good ideas for improving
