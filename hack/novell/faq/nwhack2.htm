<H3><A NAME="section_02_1"></A>02-1. What is Accounting?</H3>

<P>
Accounting is Novell's pain in the butt way to control and manage
access to the server in a way that is &quot;accountable&quot;.
The admin set up charge rates for blocks read and written, service
requests, connect time, and disk storage. The account &quot;pays&quot;
for the service by being given some number, and the accounting
server deduces for these items. How the account actually pays
for these items (departmental billing, cash, whatever) you may
or may not want to know about, but the fact that it could be installed
could leave a footprint that you've been there.
<P>
Any valid account, including non-supe accounts, can check to see
if Accounting is turned on. Simply run SYSCON and try to access
Accounting, if you get a message that Accounting is not installed,
then guess what? Since it is a pain to administer, many sys admins
will turn it on simply to time-stamp each login and logout, track
intruders, and include the node address and account name of each
of these items.
<H3><A NAME="section_02_2"></A>02-2. How do I defeat Accounting?
</H3>

<P>
Turn it off. And spoof your node address. Here's the steps -
<UL>
<LI>Spoof your address (see below). Use a supe account's typical
node address as your own.
<LI>If you are using a backdoor, activate it with SUPER.EXE.
<LI>Delete Accounting by running SYSCON, selecting Accounting,
Accounting
</UL>

<P>
Servers, hitting the delete key, and answering yes when asked
if you wish to delete accounting. The last entry in the NET$ACCT.DAT
file will be your login time-stamped with the spoofed node address.
<UL>
<LI>Now do what you will in the system. Use a different account
if you like, it won't show up in the log file.
<LI>When done, login with the original account, run SYSCON and
re-install Accounting. Immediately logout, and the next line in
the NET$ACCT.DAT file will be your logout, showing a login and
logout with the same account name, nice and neat.
</UL>

<P>
If you can't spoof the address (some LAN cards don't allow it
or require extra drivers you may not have), just turn off Accounting
and leave it off or delete the NET$ACCT.DAT file located in the
SYS:SYSTEM directory.
<P>
It should be noted that to turn off and on Accounting you need
supe equivalent, but you don't need supe equivalence to spoof
the address.
<H3><A NAME="section_02_3"></A>02-3. What is Intruder Detection?
</H3>

<P>
Intruder Detection is Novell's way of tracking invalid password
attempts. While this feature is turned off by default, most sites
practicing any type of security will at minimum turn this feature
on. There are several parameters to Intruder Detection. First,
there is a setting for how long the server will remember a bad
password attempt. Typically this is set to 30 minutes, but can
be as short as 10 minutes of as long as 7 days. Then there is
a setting for how many attempts will lockout the account. This
is usually 3 attempts, but can be as short as 1 or as many as
7. Finally is the length the account is locked out. The default
is 30 minutes but it can range from 10 minutes to 7 days.
<P>
When an Intruder Detection occurs, the server beeps and a time-stamped
message is displayed on the System Console with the account name
that is now locked out and the node address from where to attempt
came from. This is also written to the File Server Error Log.
A Supervisor or equivalent can unlock the account before it frees
itself up, and the File Server Error Log can also be erased by
a Supervisor or equivalent.
<P>
In a large shop, it is not unusual to see Intruder Lockouts even
on a daily basis, and forgetting a password is a typical regular-user
thing to do. Intruder Lockouts on Supervisor or equivalent account
is usually noticed.
<H3><A NAME="section_02_4"></A>02-4. What are station/time restrictions?
</H3>

<P>
Time restrictions can be placed on an account to limit the times
in which an account can be logged in. In the account is already
logged in and the time changes to a restricted time, the account
is logged out. The restriction can be per weekday down to the
half hour. That means that if an admin wants to restrict an account
from logging in except on Monday through Friday from 8-5, it can
be done. Only Supervisor and equivalents can alter time restrictions.
Altering the time at the workstation will not get you around time
restrictions, only altering time at the server can change the
ability to access.
<P>
Station restriction place a restriction on <I>where</I> an account
can be used.
<P>
Restrictions can be to a specific token ring or ethernet segment,
and can be specific down to the MAC layer address, or node address.
The only way around a station restriction at the node address
is to spoof the address from a workstation on the same segment
or ring as the address you are spoofing. Like time restrictions,
only Supervisor and equivalents can alter station restrictions.
<H3><A NAME="section_02_5"></A>02-5. How do I spoof my node or
IP address?</H3>

<P>
This will depend greatly on what kind of network interface card
(NIC) the workstation has, as to whether you can perform this
function. Typically you can do it in the Link Driver section of
the NET.CFG file by adding the following line - NODE ADDRESS xxxxxxxxxxxx
where xxxxxxxxxxxx is the 12 digit MAC layer address. This assumes
you are using Netware's ODI drivers, if you are using NDIS drivers
you will have to add the line to a PROTOCOL.INI or IBMENII.NIF
file, which usually has the lines already in it.
<P>
For an IP address, you may have to run a TCPIP config program
to make it work (it depends on whose IP stack you are running).
Some implementations will have the mask, the default router and
the IP address in the NET.CFG, some in the TCPIP.CFG. It is a
good idea to look around in all network-related subdirectories
to see if there are any .CFG, .INI, or .NIF files that may contain
addresses.
<P>
Getting the target node address should be pretty easy. Login with
any account and do a USERLIST /A. This will list all accounts
currently logged in with their network and node address. If your
workstation is on the same network as the target, you can spoof
the address no problem. Actually you can spoof the address regardless
but to defeat station restrictions you must be on the same network.
<H3><A NAME="section_02_6"></A>02-6. How do I defeat console logging?
</H3>

<P>
Here you need console and Supervisor access. The site is running
3.11 or higher and running the CONLOG.NLM. Any site running this
is trapping all console messages to a file. If you run SETPWD
at the console, the response by SETPWD is written to a log file.
Here's the steps for determining if it is running and what to
do to defeat it:
<UL>
<LI>Type <TT>MODULES</TT> at the console. Look for the CONLOG.NLM.
If it's there, it's running.
<LI>Look on the server in SYS:ETC for a file called CONSOLE.LOG.
This is a plain text file that you can type out. However you cannot
delete or edit it while CONLOG is running.
<LI>Unload CONLOG at the console.
<LI>Delete, or even better yet, edit the CONSOLE.LOG file, erasing
your tracks.
<LI>Reload CONLOG. It will show that is has been restarted in
the log.
<LI>Check the CONSOLE.LOG file to ensure the owner has not changed.
<LI>Run <TT>PURGE</TT> in the SYS:ETC directory to purge old versions
of CONSOLE.LOG that your editor have left to be salvaged.
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="section_02_7"></A>02-7. How does password encryption work?</H3>

<CENTER>- From itsme -</CENTER>

the password encryption works as follows:
<OL TYPE=1, 2, 3, ...>
<LH></LH><LI> the workstation requests a session key from the server (NCP-17-17)
<LI>the server sends a unique 8 byte key to the workstation
<LI>the workstation encrypts the password with the userid,
  - this 16 byte value is what is stored in the bindery on the server
<LI>the WS then encrypts this 16 byte value with the 8 byte session key
resulting in 8 bytes, which it sends to the server
(NCP-17-18 = login), (NCP-17-4a = verify pw) (NCP-17-4b = change pw)
<LI>the server performs the same encryption, and compares its own result
with that sent by the WS
</OL>

the information contained in the net$*.old files which can be found
in the system directory after bindfix was run, is enough to login
to the server as any object. just skip step 3

<H3><A NAME="section_02_8"></A>02-8. Can I set the RCONSOLE password to work for just Supervisor?</H3>

Yes and no. In version 3.x, the Supe password always works.<P>

A common mistake regarding 3.x RCONSOLE passwords is to use a switch to use
only the Supervisor password. It works like this:<P>

<TT>LOAD REMOTE /P=</TT>  , instead of <BR>
 <TT> LOAD REMOTE RCONPASSWORD</TT><P>


The admin believes /P= turns off everything except the Supe password for
RCONSOLE.   In fact the password is just set to /P= which will get you in!
The second most common mistake is using -S.<P>

Version 4.1 is a bit different. Here's how it works:<P>

<UL>
<LI>At the console prompt, type LOAD REMOTE SECRET where SECRET is the Remote Console password.
<LI>Now type REMOTE ENCRYPT. You will be prompted for a password to encrypt.
<LI>This will give you the encrypted version of the password, and give you the option of writing LDREMOTE.NCF to the SYS:SYSTEM directory, containing all 
the entries for loading Remote Console support.
</UL>
<P>
You can call LDREMOTE from your AUTOEXEC.NCF, or you can change the
LOAD REMOTE line in the AUTOEXEC.NCF as follows:<P>

<TT>LOAD REMOTE SECRET</TT>        ; becomes<BR>

<TT>LOAD REMOTE -E 870B7E366363</TT><P>

<H3><A NAME="section_02_9"></A>02-9. Can access to .NCF files help me?</H3>

Access to any .NCF file can bypass security, as these files are traditionally
run from the console and assume the security access of the console. The
addition of a few lines to any .NCF file can get you access to that system.<P>

The most vulnerable file would be the AUTOEXEC.NCF file. Adding a couple of
lines to run BURGLAR.NLM or SETPWD.NLM would certainly get you access. But
remember there are other .NCF files that can be used and exploited. For
example, ASTART.NCF and ASTOP.NCF are used to start and stop Arcserve, the
most popular backup system for Netware. The LDREMOTE.NCF as mentioned in
section 02-8 is another potential target.<P>

The lines you might add to such a file might be as follows:<P>
<TT>
UNLOAD CONLOG<BR>
LOAD SETPWD SUPERVISOR SECRET<BR>
CLS<BR>
LOAD CONLOG
</TT><P>
This assumes you had read/write access to the location of the .NCF file
and can copy SETPWD.NLM to the server. Note that by unloading CONLOG you 
are only partially covering your tracks, in the CONSOLE.LOG file it will
be obvious that CONLOG was unloaded and reloaded. The CLS is to keep your
activities off of the server's screen.<P>

The best .NCF for this is obviously one that is either used during the
server's boot process or during some automated process. This way a short
.NCF and its activities may escape the eyes of an admin during execution.<P>
