HACK
<img src="netware.gif"></h2>
</center>

The <a href="hack.exe"><b>Hack</b></a> program will grant supervisor
equivalency to all users on a
network if it is run while the supervisor is logged in.  It works (I've
tested it).  Patches are available from Novell to circumvent this hole.
It was discovered by students and professors at Lieden University in the
Netherlands.<p>

<a href="view.exe"><b>View</b></a> is a utility to show users logged in
with Supervisor equivalency.<p>

There is a version of <b>hack</b> that will work on a patched Novell
server.  Novell's patch only hashed the first several bytes of the
packet to make it secure, the new <b>hack</b> uses this weakness
to get by the patch.<p>
