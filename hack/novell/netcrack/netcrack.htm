<h3>Advanced NetWare Security Cracker</h3>
<h4>Version 1.00</h4>
</center>
<h4>WHAT IS NETCRACK?</h4>
<ul>
<b>NetCrack</b>--the   Advanced  NetWare   Security  Cracker--is  a
software  utility for use with  networks operating under the
Novell   Advanced  NetWare  network  operating  system.  The
NET$OS.EXE  file is patched so that the security information
created  with  SYSCON is  disabled.  NetCrack  is compatible
with  Advanced NetWare 86 and  Advanced NetWare 286 Versions
1.00 through 2.15.
</ul>
<h4>HOW DOES NETCRACK WORK?</h4>
<ul>
<b>NetCrack</b> installs  patches io the  NET$OS.EXE file to
disable use of the security information created with SYSCON.
Security  data is  maintained in the  files NET$BIND.SYS and
NET$BVAL.SYS   located  in  SYS:SYSTEM.  NETCRACK  will  not
damage  the existing security  files.  The original security
may   be  restored   by  invoking   the  original  unpatched
NET$OS.EXE.
<p>
<b>NetCrack</b> may be used to gain access to a fileserver when the
SUPERVISOR  password is unknown.  It is  necessary to have a
copy  of  NET$OS.EXE from  SYS:SYSTEM or  to generate  a new
operating  system with the  correct driver set.  This backup
copy  of  NET$OS.EXE is  the  target file  for  the NETCRACK
utility.
<p>
To  use  NETCRACK,   boot  DOS on  the  fileserver.  Execute
NETCRACK.  Select  the  CRACK  option  from  the  menu  with
the  backup  copy  of  NET$OS.EXE  as  the target.  CHECKSUM
the  patched  operating  system.  Then  invoke  the  patched
NET$OS.EXE  from  Drive  A:.  This  will  bring  up NetWare.
LOGIN  as SUPERVISOR from  any workstation.  PASSWORD is not
required.  The  NET$BIND.SYS and  NET$BVAL.SYS files  may be
flagged  Read/Write  (RW)   and  deleted.  Then  invoke  the
original  unpatched operating system,   login as SUPERVISOR,
and setup new security with SYSCON.
<p>
If  using NETGEN to  create a backup  operating system,  the
NET$OS.EX1  and  NET$OS.EX2  files must  be  concatenated as
follows:<p>
<ul>
<i>COPY/B NET$OS.EX1+NET$OS.EX2 NET$OS.EXE</i>
</ul>
<p>
If using NETGEN with high capacity diskettes,  NET$OS.EX1 is
the target for NETCRACK.
<p>
If you only have 360K diskette drives available, you may use
the  program SPLIT to split your patched NET$OS.EXE into two
pieces which will fit on 360K diskettes.
