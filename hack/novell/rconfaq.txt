RCONSOLE Hacking

In this article I intend on showing you how to extract the RCONSOLE password
from a sniffer trace to gain access to a Novell Netware's server console.
While versions 3.x and 4.x employ packet signature and encryption techniques
for a user to login, RCONSOLE (Remote CONSOLE) used a single password to 
launch a remote session to the server's console, allowing an administrator 
to type in commands as if they are at the console itself. 

While this article assumes some basic Netware knowledge, I do want to cover
a few items regarding security.

Security Quick Basics
---------------------

There are 5 different levels of security within Netware at the file level. 
These are:

1. Not logged in. All you need is a connection to the server, you do not
need to log in. This level of access allows running the most simple commands,
such as LOGIN.EXE, SLIST.EXE, and basically any utility loaded into the
SYS:LOGIN directory that doesn't require additional access.

2. Logged in. Basic access controlled through Trustee Rights.

3. Operator access. Operators have basic access and can control print queues,
run a few special commands including FCONSOLE.

4. Supervisor access. Full access to the file system. This is the access level
most guarded, as you can get to any and every file on the system, administer
and control virtually every aspect from user access to server configuration
to security.

5. OS access. This is the level of access that processes running on the 
server run at. Most commands typed in at the console run at this level, and 
while you cannot access the file system at the level of detail that you can 
as a Supervisor, you can certainly open the door for Supervisor access. NLMs 
(Network Loadable Modules) are programs that when loaded at the console 
become a part of the Netware OS environment. Some NLMs stay loaded, some 
perform their task and then unload themselves, but all of them run at this 
level of security. Gaining access to the console gives you this level of 
access.

What we are going to cover is an inherit weakness within the security system 
of Netware -- remote access to the console. While Novell has gone to great
lengths to ensure adequate security for security levels 1-4 listed above,
RCONSOLE access is protected by a single password with simple encryption, 
encryption that can be broken. One of the tools I will refer to is RCON.EXE. 
This utility, written by itsme of the Netherlands (author of HACK.EXE, 
KNOCK.EXE and several other notorious Netware tools), allows you to take 
information gained from a sniffer trace of the RCONSOLE initialization 
conversation and break the encryption -- essentially "decrypting" the 
RCONSOLE password.

Once you have the RCONSOLE password, you can employ other techniques to open
a door to the entire file system -- Supervisor access.

The hardest part, in my opinion, is getting the trace. Most of the 
information in this article involves technical items based on predictable and
repeatable facts. But getting the capture of a trace using a sniffer can be 
very tricky. You are dealing with a few different items - accessability, 
availability, and timing.

Accessability
-------------

You will need access to the network. Specifically, you will need to run your 
sniffer trace either on the server's segment or the user's segment, otherwise 
you may never see the conversation. While it is possible to run the trace on 
a segment over which the traffic passes, it is easier to find out the segment 
of the user. The easiest way is to log into the a server that the target user 
logs into and type USERLIST /A. From the list you should see the network and 
the node address. The network number is the segment the user is on, and the 
node address is the 12-digit hex number burnt into the network interface card 
(NIC), also known as the MAC, or Media Access Control address.

Of course the proceeding paragraph assumes you have physical access to the 
network. It is possible to dial into a LAN running pcAnywhere, install a 
DOS-based sniffer, and capture packets. It is also possible to get to a Unix
box and start up a sniffer there. I will not get into those details here, but
you have to assume that the System Administrator doesn't have the pcAnywhere 
dial-in machine right there at his desk, or you can get by the firewall. S/he
might notice a sniffer running and start a trace.

Availability
------------

Running a sniffer trace is pretty CPU intensive. The CPU must be fast enough 
to copy all info from the NIC's buffer to RAM without missing a packet. If 
your sniffer is filtering information, that is, if it is looking at the 
insides of each packet and only saving those that meet certain criteria, this 
can be even more CPU intensive. Some of you may have already noticed a big 
dilemma. You have to have a sniffer running on a computer that can handle a 
decent amount of CPU activity (486 recommended), attached to a specific 
network, and allowed to run without someone walking up and noticing. And the 
brings us to the last problem.

Timing
------

This one is the kicker. If you can meet the previous requirements, then you 
are left with the hardest one -- getting the actually packet captured. This 
can be accomplished in one of two ways. First, through some social 
engineering you can create a need for the Sys Admin to launch RCONSOLE, or 
you can filter out and look for that single packet that contains the 
password. 

The first way is a bit tricky, but not impossible. Posing as a new employee,
call the Sys Admin and say that when you try to log in you keep getting the
message "The SUPERVISOR has disabled the login function". To fix this, the
normal thing to do is type ENABLE LOGIN at the console prompt. The Admin will
invariably launch RCONSOLE to correct the problem, and then you have your
packet. S/he will tell you that everything looks okay, so then say "my 
computer is locked up". They will probably conclude that the problem is at
your workstation and advise you to reboot, with the chances being very good
they'll say "When it comes up you should be okay, so call me back if there
is a problem" and then hang up. Fine. You've got the packet.

The second one depends on your sniffer. If it can actually analyze packets
in real time, have it capture only packets between the Sys Admin's desk and
the server, plus only save SPX packets. If it only works using a pattern
match of some kind, use the detailed information on identifying the packets
to find a specific pattern for your sniffer to key off of. At the end of the 
next section are some pattern matching tips.

A final note on accessability, availability, and timing -- a carefully placed
laptop with an Ethernet PCMCIA running sniffer software AND filtering
capabilities will get you everything.

Analyzing the Packets
---------------------

Once you've captured packets from your user, you need to be able to look at
the data and interpret it. You must be able to find the packets coming from 
the user going to the server. Depending on your sniffer, this may prove to be
quite a task. Most of the high-priced sniffers allow you to filter on 
addresses and packet type, and these features are great for finding exactly 
what you need. But the low-end solutions, especially freeware or shareware, 
may have little or no filtering capability, and that means looking at a lot 
of hex dumps.

But we will assume that you know how to use your sniffer (or get the dump 
from a promiscuous network card) and at least get to the point of finding the
user's and the server's conversation. To help you find these packets, we will
discuss ways to find the addresses.

Now here are the first three packets that are sent after the user has hit 
enter after entering the password.

Ethernet packet sent from the workstation to the server to establish the SPX 
connection:

To explain a bit of what is going on, let's look at what makes up these 
packets, starting with the first one.

Offset 00h through 0Dh is the Data Link Control layer:

0010  00 2A 04 05                                       FF FF is a checksum
                                                        10h and 11h is the IPX 
                                                        length, 12h is the
                                                        transport control, 13h
                                                        is the IPX packet type 
                                                        (05 is SPX).

0010              00 00 00 03  00 00 00 00 00 01 81 04  14h through 1Fh is the

                                                        section with 2Ch the
                                                        control type, 2Dh the
                                                        datastream type, and
                                                        2Eh and 2Fh the SPX
                                                        source connection ID.

0030  FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 06                           30h and 31h are the 
                                                        destination connect
                                                        ID. FF FF is a 
                                                        broadcast or the 1st
                                                        SPX packet in this 
                                                        conversation. The 
                                                        next 3 byte pairs are
                                                        the sequence number,
                                                        the acknowledgement 
                                                        number and the 
                                                        allocation number.

0030                                       ED 05 00 00  The minimum length for
                                                        a packet will be 60
                                                        bytes, so if there 
                                                        is no data then the
                                                        last 4 bytes are 
                                                        padded with junk.

Pattern Matching Tips 

1. Look for FF FF xx xx xx 05 to find an SPX packet starting at offset 0Eh.
2. The address of the server starts at offset 14h, in the above packet it is 
   00000003:000000000001 with an IPX socket of 8104. All IPX conversations use                  
   IPX socket numbers, so pattern match off of 14h through 1Dh.   
3. The address of the user starts at offset 20h, in the above packet it is 
   00000002:02608CA7E9AA with an IPX socket of 500E. Pattern match on offset
   20h through 29h.

With the information above you should be able to identify an SPX packet when 
you see one, and identify the addresses of the server and the user. Now let's
use this information to get what we need out of the third packet we've
captured, the one with the RCONSOLE password.

What we need is the network address (offset 20h through 23h), the node 
address (offset 24h through 29h) and the actual encrypted password. In the
data section starting at 38h, 38h will always be FE and 39h will always be 
FF. The next 8 bytes will be the password bytes. I know what you're thinking,
there's a lot of other bytes there, but the first 8 are the significant ones.
Not exactly C2, are we?

Running RCON
------------

From the example above, the password is 47455A4D4E248C9C, the network is
00000002 and the node is 02608CA7E9AA. Therefore you would run RCON as 
follows:

RCON 47455A4D4E248C9C 00000002 02608CA7E9AA

It will response with the following:

decrypted pw:
0000 : 47 45 5a 4f 4e 44 00 3b e9 aa 15 15 15 17 17 75  - GEZOND.;È™.....u
node address after encryption:
0000 : 11 11 11 13 13 71 9d b8 e5 a6                    - .....qù∏Â¶      

As you can see, the RCONSOLE password is "GEZOND".

The Next Step
-------------

Now a few things to keep in mind when accessing the console remotely. When 
using RCONSOLE, your activities are being recorded. So after getting the
password, don't just jump into RCONSOLE without planning on doing something
to cover your tracks. And to cover your tracks you must gain access to the
file system.

A quick note -- since the Supervisor password also works with RCONSOLE,
always try to login as Supervisor with the password you have uncovered. If
you get in, great. Full access to the file system.

Now I'm not going to go into a LOT of detail here, but there are several
techniques you can use to gain access to the file system as Supervisor. All
of the ones I'm going to mention involve uploading NLMs to the file server
and then running them. RCONSOLE has a built-in option to upload files to
the server (hit * on the keypad and select the option for transferring
files to the server). You should immediately upload a nefarious NLM to gain
file system access and wipe your tracks. Here is a quick example, once again 
assuming some general Netware admin knowledge:

1. At the system console, type in UNLOAD CONLOG. If CONLOG is loaded, every
response to every command at the console is being written to a file. The 
CONLOG.NLM comes with 4.x but works with 3.x.

2. Upload BURGLAR.NLM and create a new user with Supervisor rights, or 
upload SETPWD.NLM and reset a Supervisor equivalent user ID's password
(BURGLAR.NLM and SETPWD.NLM can be found on the Internet).

3. Exit RCONSOLE and login.

4. Delete BURGLAR.NLM or SETPWD.NLM and purge it from the system.

5. If CONLOG was loaded, find and delete or edit the CONSOLE.LOG file to 
remove your activity. Delete or edit SYS$LOG.ERR and remove any activity 
you create there. If you delete these files, purge them. If you edit these
files, use FILER to reset the ownership of the file.

Of course the quick-witted admin might notice CONLOG isn't loaded -- if I
think an admin is going to notice that, I reboot the server by running an
NCF file with the following lines:

REMOVE DOS
DOWN
EXIT

When running this NCF file, I remain remoted into the console in case I need 
to answer Yes to the "are you sure" questions. For more information on
creating and running NCF files, refer to one of hundreds of Netware books
currently available at any bookstore.

Conclusions
-----------

Well, the first conclusion is that Netware's RCONSOLE utility isn't very
secure! If you are an administrator, the only way to thwart this type of
attack at this time is to upgrade to 4.x and use packet signature.

Of course the other items to recap are 1) you are going to need a little
time and access, both at the RIGHT time; 2) you are going to have to have a
couple more tools (like SETPWD.NLM or BURGLAR.NLM) to gain file system
access; 3) it is highly recommended you work quickly (duh); and 4) you should
cover your tracks as best you can.

Have fun and happy hacking.
