  Welcome to National Security Anarchists Newsletter #3.  We have heard many
  great responses from the so-called H/P wastelands.  Yes, so barren, but there
  still exists a few intelligent minds left.  While the rest of H/P world
  continues to jerk themselves off with codes, scans, and old issues of Phrack.
  One could can be developing their H/P skills even more by just doing Hacker
  Basic.  Hacker Basic?  No, not a programming language.  But the ability to
  READ!  Yes, what most of America teenagers cannot do today, but yet excel
  greatly in their current career, Stupidity.  Reading allows you to expand
  your ideas and concepts.  Sure read old information, but what do you do after
  that? Most of you just sit around, praising Phrack & LOD/H. These guys are
  dead and gone!  Sure, remember them and remember them well.  But you cannot
  live in the past, for while you sit on your ass, Ma Bell can then destroy
  you, destroy the whole concept of the H/P world.  What do you choose?

                         == GTD-5 SVR 1711 Features ==


  CALL GAPPING FOR LOCAL CODES

    Allows control of incoming trunk-to-line calls only, line-to-line calls
    only, or control of both at different gap intervals - defined as control of
    traffic categories.

    The number of simultaneous code controls (destination and local) are
    increased from 64 to 256.

    Controls calls to terminating codes for the following:

      o  Any subscriber line
      o  Hunt group pilot number
      o  Attendant group listed directory number(s)
      o  10-digit directory number in a subtending PBX

    Gap intervals settable for: 0(no control), 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 ,15, 30, 60,
    120, 300, and 600 seconds.  An infinite interval is also available.


  DEFINE "VIA" ROUTES BY TRUNK GROUP NUMBER

    Allows the Network Manager to engineer each site for associated traffic
    types to route index in terms of route index pair relationships for reroute
    controls.  This provides the capability to specify the reroute as a "from"
    TGN and a "to" (VIA) TGN without having to recall complex routing chains
    and routing index information.


  RATE INTERVALS FOR NSM CONTROLS

    Provides the option of designating the amount of traffic controlled by rate
    (time) interval for the following NSM route controls:

       o  Cancel-To
       o  Cancel-From
       o  Skip Route
       o  Spray Reroute
       o  Spray Immediate Reroute
       o  Selective Trunk Reservation

    Selectable intervals for each traffic type: 1-60 seconds in 1 second
    increments, 120, 300, and 600 seconds.  An infinite interval is also
    available as well as 2 calls per second for intervals less than 1 second.


  SPRAY ROUTE CONTROLS

    Reroute controls will be modified from the existing eight pairs of from/to
    routes to eight sets of from/to routes.  A set of from/to routes consists
    of one traffic donor (from) route and up to seven out-of-chain "VIA" (to)
    routes accessed with a spray hunt technique.  The spray hunt technique
    diveds the rerouted traffic evenly among the out-of-chain trunk groups
    through a rotation scheme.  The reroute control will permit the option to
    define the traffic donor (from) and "VIA" (to) routes by trunk group
    numbers.



  SS7 BASED NON-ISDN VOICE MESSAGE WAITING INDICATION CONTROL

    Extension of the SVR 1641 Voice messaging feature using a SS7 network
    based, ANSI standard, messaging system.  The GTD-5 will receive SS7
    requests from a Voice Message Storage and Retrieval System (VMSR) to
    activate or deactivate a Voice Waiting Indicator (MWI) for a subscriber.
    The GTD-5 will update the subscriber's MWI and return a successful or
    failure response via SS7 to VMSR.

    This feature does not impact the existing in-band VMSR capabilities.  An
    individual GTD-5 site may have only in-band or only SS7 or both
    capabilities.  This feature provides the GTD-5 with capability to support
    up to 127 different VMSR systems.


  INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR 15 DIGITAL DIALING (CCITT E.164)

    The GTD-5 can presently handle 15 dialed digits for digit translation
    screening and call routing functions.  GTE AMA record formats will be
    modified to account for 15 digital international numbers as specified in
    CCITT E.164 recommendations.

    Bellcore LSSGR AMA specifications have not been issued for 15 digit
    international records and will not be included in this SVR.


  CALL WAITING/CALL FORWARDING BUSY INTEGRATION

    Currently, Call Waiting overrides Call Forwarding Busy. Customer in focus
    groups who have both Personal Secretary (VMSR) and Call Waiting have
    requested the ability to have calls forwarded to their Call Waiting feature
    while they are receiving a call.  This feature enhancement will facilitate
    the ability to see Call Waiting and Voice Mail services together.

    This is a changed feature interaction.  No new classmarks are involved. All
    subscribers with both features active will get this new interaction.

    For a terminating party disconnect with call waiting situation, the
    terminator will be rung for custom calling as in current treatment. During
    custom call rering, call forwarding will be attempted at the end of the
    original call forwarding don't answer timeout.


  CUSTOMER CONTROLLABLE RINGING INTERVAL FOR CALL FORWARD DON'T ANSWER

    This feature allows the customer who subscribes to Call Forwarding Don't
    Answer the ability to control the number of rings (1-9) before the call is
    forwarded.  The type of ringing provided for a call will not be affected by
    this feature.


  AUDIBLE MESSAGE WAITING INDICATION VIA PERIODIC RINGING BURSTS

    With the exception of customers served by featurephones, Message Waiting
    Indication is currently provided on via stutter dial tone.  As an option
    this feature would provide a double ring (0.5 seconds on, 0.5 seconds off,
    0.5 seconds on) to indicate a waiting message.  The first double ring would
    occur within 5 minutes of receiving a message and would be repeated every
    15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes as selected by a Recent Change command.  The
    customer controls this feature's activation/deactivation similar to Call
    Forwarding Variable.  This feature will not be given to a line with the Do
    Not Disturb Feature activated.


  ANONYMOUS CALLER REJECTION

    This feature is a variation of the CLASS Selective Call Rejection feature.
    CLASS Anonymous Caller Rejection prevents termination of anonymous calls
    (Calling Number Delivery Blocked) to a CLASS customer's line by routing
    these calls to a special announcement which informs the caller that they
    may complete a call to this subscriber if they allow their calling number
    to be delivered.


  TERMINATING END OFFICE SCANNING ALLOWED (TR-TSY-000215 3.5.8)

    This feature allows the GTD-5 to be compatible with TR-TSY-000215, Issue 1,
    Sept. 88.

    The parameter as defined in the referenced TR is used to control whether an
    office will request termination scanning as the initial choice of
    originating scanning for outgoing Automatic Callback/Automatic recall
    (AC/AR) requests. The current GTD-5 design interprets this parameter to
    apply to inbound terminating scanning AC/AR requests.  With both parameters
    defined in the GTD-5, GTE may enforce originating or terminating scanning
    on outbound requests and also force other offices to use originating
    scanning rather than terminating scanning.


  AC/AR FEATURE TIME RANGES (TR-TSY-000215 AND 227)

    This feature allows the GTD-5 to be compatible with the latest TR's.

    The following timers will be modified:

      o  T1 Originating Scanning Rate = 10 - 120 seconds (60 seconds
         recommended)
      o  T2 Wait Between Unanswered Special Ringing Attempts = 1-12 minutes
   (4 minutes recommended-maximum number of unanswered
         special rings is 15)
      o  T8 Resume Term Scanning to Same Line Timing = 17 (2 ringing cycles) -
         60 seconds (35 seconds-5 ringing cycles is recommended)
      o  T10 Maximum Time Callback remains Queued = 3-4 hours


  COT-IDENTIFICATION CALL WAITING INDICATION IN PRINTOUT

    This is an enhancement to the Customer Originated Trace feature to provide
    a printout that will indicate that the last answered call was a Call
    Waiting call.


  SCREEN LIST EDITING CHANGES

    This is an enhancement to allow the following CLASS Screen List Editing
    options:

      o  Allow code for deleting all entries
      o  Allow code for deleting all private entries
      o  Allow last answered number to be added to any screening list
      o  New treatment of entry with private mark when entered as public


  AC/AR REQUESTS TO HGRP PILOT NUMBERS

    This allows the GTD-5 to be compatible with the appropriate TR's by queuing
    calls placed via AC/AR if all members of a hunt group are busy and
    immediately completing AC/AR calls if any member is idle.

  AC/AR INTERACTION WITH CALL WAITING

    The GTD-5 currently will queue an AC/AR request to a line with call waiting
    when the line is busy with one call.  This feature will not queue the call
    but go to immediate processing and the terminating line will receive a call
    waiting tone.


  914E WILTRON CABLE ANALYZER SHARING

    Siemens Transmission Systems has developed a feature on the 914E MXU which
    allows sharing of one Wiltron Cable Analyzer (MCA) among up to 5 MXU units
    in the same cabinet.  the GTD-5 MXU software will be modified to allow up
    to 16 i14E MXU's to share the same MCA.  The MCA cannot be shared between
    Direct Interfaced MXU's and COT Interfaced MXU's.


  PERFORM SHORT % WAIT(S) WITHOUT ALLOCATING A BUFFER

    Timeout buffers will no longer be used for short waits, under 5 slices/50
    milliseconds.  This will save real time and reduce buffer pool
    fragmentation caused by short waits.

  SPEED UP BUFFER ALLOCATION SEARCH LOOP

    With the removal of sequence buffers from the buffer pool, buffer pool
    fragmentation has become less of a problem.  Now with less fragmentation,
    processor real time in the APC will be saved by adopting a buffer
    allocation method similar to non-APC processors, which reduces time spent
    in the allocation search loop.  In addition, real time will also be saved
    during buffer de-allocation by releasing multiple buffers at one time using
    a new "flush buffers" function.


  OUTGOING TRUNKS CALL CUTOFF ENHANCEMENT

    On a line-to-trunk call, there are occasions where a "hangup" from the
    outgoing trunk is caused by a network problem.  This feature provides a SMA
    printout for the Telco to identify the specific trunk group, trunk, carrier
    ID, calling and called numbers as well as the calculated interval of cutoff
    elapsed time.

    This feature only applies to calls where called party hangup does not
    release the call (e.g. called party timed released.


  MEASUREMENT CALLING/BILLING NUMBER DELIVERS TO CUSTOMER LINE

    This feature modifies GTD-5 implementation to be compliant with LSSGR AMA
    format (TR-TSY-000031, Issue 3, Jan. 90) for usage sensitive billing and
    AMA format for the calling number delivery (CAD) feature.

    This feature is applicable to any line (directory number) assigned the
    Calling Number Delivery or Calling Number Display features. Billing will no
    longer be based on activation/deactivation of these features.

    A Usage-Sensitive CAD is assigned to a DN via a service order. The count of
    DNs delivered will not be applicable for intragroup calls. Up to 65,000
    lines can be assigned usage-sensitive CAD.  Each DN assigned the
    Usage-Sensitive CAD feature will have two AMA counts with a maximum value
    of each counter of 32,767:

      o  Count of DNs delivered
      o  Count of private and out-of-area indicators delivered

    An AMA record will be generated once every 24 hours of each DN with
    non-zero counts.  An AMA record will be generated immediately if a
    particular counter reaches 32,000.  If all counters are zero, or no lines
    in the CO have the feature assigned, a single record is produced to
    indicate the task executed correctly.


  FLIP CMD ON RSNW DOES NOT WORK

    This feature extends the Base Unit capability of a "simplex-to-simplex
    switch", the ability to change from a simplex 0 configuration to a simplex
    1 configuration (or vice versa) without an intervening duplex stage, to a
    Remote Unit Network.

    This capability is useful during retrofit intervals and repair of faults
    where the system was not able to correctly isolate the faulty copy.


  MXU OUTAGE TIME REDUCTION

    This feature reduces the software loading time for multiple MXU processors
    loads.  A broadcast mechanism will be used to transport fewer messages
    between the APC and the outermost superordinate processor (TCU or RSU).

    This feature will be transparent to the craftsperson and is estimated to
    result in 4% reduction in APC real time per MXU.

                           == High Speed Networks ==
                             == GTE Project 434 ==


  With the move to higher speed networks, many fundamental issues in control
  and design of networks need to be examined afresh.  This project has
  attempted to address critical architectural issues to ensure that all aspects
  of these emerging high-speed technologies reflect the needs of GTE's future
  high-bandwidth services.

  The feasibility of transporting motion video over an ATM (asynchronous
  transfer mode) network was investigated for Telops, with a major report
  provided (jointly with Project 552) on the feasibility of end-to-end ATM for
  a number of video services.  Through experiments, it was demonstrated that
  performance improves when the cell transmissions from each video source are
  smoothed at least on a per frame basis; this removes constraints on the
  synchronization of the frames across video sequences sharing the same network
  resources.  It was shown that for uncorrelated sources, a network utilization
  of 0.8 is achievable with minimal cell loss (0.5 for correlated sources). For
  congestion control at the call level, a histogram-based traffic descriptor
  and call admission policy was proposed.

  Technical assessments were carried out for Telops on the technical
  feasibility and complexity of providing (1) remote LAN interconnection
  service using the Metropolitan Area Network standard, DQDB, and DQDB-based
  SMDS (Switched Multimegabit Data Service), and (2) interactive video
  communication services over a DQDB network.  The first study found that
  whereas SMDS exploits many advantages of DQDB, the lack of reconfiguration
  capability of the Open Bus access DQDB is a serious concern; it was proposed
  that where reliability is critical, the Looped Bus topology be provided as an
  option.  the second study concluded that since neither of the non-Isochronous
  service capabilities supports bandwidth reservation, it is necessary to
  employ the Isochronous service capability -- which provides circuit-like
  transport -- to guarantee quality of service for all real-time video
  services.

  This project also contributed to the ACORN project on lightwave networks at
  Columbia University.  ACORN has industry-wide participation and is
  investigating fully optical networks: stations have tunable transmitters and
  receivers, and are connected by a passive optical medium.  A fundamental
  problem associated with connection establishment on a packet by packet basis
  was investigated in collaboration with staff at Columbia University and BNR.
  A new hybrid time division multiplexing scheme was proposed and analyzed.

  As part of system design of the advanced intelligent network (AIN) testbed, a
  number of performance/architectural studies were carried out.  In particular,
  the performance impact of introducing AIN service on the GTD-5 and the PAP (a
  pre-adjunct-processor in the AIN testbed) was analyzed, using a network of
  queues model.  Preliminary results indicate that for 20% AIN penetration,
  system performance is only marginally affected, and an effective bandwidth of
  1 to 2 Mb/s is sufficient for the switch-adjunct interface.

                    == Statistical Methods in Reliability ==
                             == GTE Project 421 ==


  The objective of this project was to develop tools applicable to
  understanding and assessing the reliability of elements of telecommunications
  systems. Research problems in statistical inference and reliability modeling
  related to the nature of data obtainable from specific activities or systems
  used in telephone operations were addressed.

  Software previously delivered to Telephone Operations for monitoring the
  speed of answer objective in customer contact offices was enhanced.  It
  execute statistical tests to determine whether performance is as expected
  after each 15-minute period and to identify some possible causes for poor
  performance.  The enhanced version completed execution for large numbers of
  incoming calls in 15 min.  Additionally, in support of force management, it
  was determined that the software currently used in other customer contact
  offices to generate capacity tables contains some errors.  The project team
  delivered the rewritten software, but did not test to determine whether the
  model is valid.  Simulation studies indicated that there are significant
  differences in the number of service representatives required when the
  model's service time distribution is invalid.  Techniques were outlined for
  analyzing data provided by the Rockwell-Collins Agent Information Reports to
  make inferences regarding customers' speed of answer tolerance.

  Evaluation of AT&T's bill verification system was completed.  A sampling
  scheme, statistical analyses, and graphics are used by AT&T to verify access
  billing by the LECs.  The system was reviewed, and formulae were derived and
  verified.  the system was found to use statistically correct methodology and
  to be objective, favoring neither AT&T nor GTE.  The critique of AT&T's
  methodology gave GTE managers in Pricing Policy and IXC Services and
  understanding of the technical details and the information necessary to
  negotiate with AT&T effectively.

  A proposal was made to replace the use of trouble per hundred lines by an
  estimate of service availability for assessing the quality of telephone
  service.

  Collaborating with scientists in the Components Technology Laboratory, the
  project staff prepared a paper that details the lack of mathematical and
  statistical rigor in the existing laser diode reliability literature and
  discusses statistical properties and some aspects of reliability modeling
  pertinent to laser diodes.

  Templates to be used by all users of the Software through Pictures to print
  out details of the Process Integration and Automation information model were
  made, and a program to construct the tree structure of inheritance
  relationships in the database was written.

  In the more basic statistics research activities, a paper on functions of
  arrangement-increasing partial ordering was submitted for publication, and a
  book on parameter estimation in reliability and life span models was
  reviewed.  Papers on Laplace ordering and its reliability applications and on
  a piecewise exponential estimator for the survivor function were accepted for
  publication.

TR-NWT-000960               Common Generic Requirements for Channel Switching
Issue 1, December 1990      in ISDN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            This document presents Bellcore's view of proposed
                            generic requirements for channel switching in the
                            Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) that
                            support private line services, also referred to as
                            channel switched services.  Included are the
                            definition of a switch complex as well as
                            requirements for switch complex interface, access,
                            interoffice transport, and operations.

TR-NWT-001024               Operator Services Systems Generic Requirements
Issue 1, December 1990      (OSSGR) Revision on Intercept Services.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            This document defines Bellcore's view of proposed
                            revisions to the intercept requirements currently
                            contained in the OSSGR.  It includes the following
                            new intercept service options: customized
                            announcements, automated split referral, intercept
                            call completion, and multiple entry
                            announcements/referrals.  The information contained
                            expands the intercept database architectures and
                            address areas where automation (dual-tone
                            multifrequency and voice recognition) are
                            appropriate.

                            There are significant changes to the two-stage
                            signaling scheme for intercept call completion
                            call, and the generation of two AMA records: one
                            records the intercept service information; the
                            other records the call completion information.

SR-NWT-000821               Field Reliability Performance Study Handbook
Issue 3, December 1990
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            This document presents Bellcore's view of generic
                            guidelines for conducting Field Reliability
                            Performance Studies (FRPSs).  An FRPS is a formal,
                            detailed study of the inservices reliability
                            performance of a product.  The study is conducted
                            to identify items that should be considered for
                            corrective action by the manufacturer or user to
                            improve product quality.

                            This handbook describes several approaches for
                            conducting an FRPS.  While it is primarily intended
                            for Bellcore Client Companies who conduct their own
                            studies, many of the principles presented are
                            applicable to any FRPS administered by Bellcore or
                            telecommunications equipment suppliers.

              == Computer Woes Wrack Phones in East, California ==
            --------------------------------------------------------

   WASHINGTON -- Service disruptions blamed on computer software plagued
 millions of telephones in the nation's capital and three nearby states
 Wednesday, and much of California had similar problems.

   Private homes and business bore the brunt of the disruptions in Washington.

   Bell Atlantic said 6.7 million phone lines in Washington, Maryland, Virginia
 and parts of West Virginia were hit with disruptions. Most service was
 restored by Wednesday evening.

   A software glitch disrupted Pacific Bell service in the Los Angeles area at
 midday Wednesday, interfering with phone calls in much of the 213, 818, 714,
 and 805 area codes.  Most service was restored by midafternoon.

                    == Journal: Pot May Help Night Vision ==
                  --------------------------------------------

   LONDON -- Marijuana may help people see in the dark, according to a letter
 in the scientific journal Nature.

   "Jamaican fishermen, it seems, have an uncanny ability to see in the dark,
 and cannabis is the magic ingredient," said M.E. West of the University of the
 West Indies.

   Most Jamaican fishermen smoke marijuana or drink an alcoholic beverage made
 from the stems and leaves of the plant, he said.

   West said he began conducting research after joining a nighttime fishing
 expedition.  He was amazed at how the crew navigated without lights because he
 could see nothing.

  [Editor Note: It is Advised to smoke great amounts not due to Night Vision]

                       == Caller ID Bills Gain Ground ==
                     -------------------------------------

   Bills mandating per-call blocking for caller ID are advancing rapidly
 through both houses of Congress.  Thursday, the caller ID bills were studied
 and changed--or "marked-up" in legislative parlance--by Senate and House
 subcommittees.  The next step will be further mark-ups by the parent
 committees before the bills are sent to the full houses for votes.

   Both bills would require all local exchange carriers to offer free per-call
 blocking.  But the House bill would apply blocking to names and address.

   Congressional staffers say both bills are expected to be modified further in
 the parent committees and possibly on the floors of both congressional bodies
 before final passage.

                       ----------------------------------

   American Telephone & Telegraph has asked federal regulators for permission
 to test a system of "personal" mobile phone that could be used at home and on
 the street, and relieve crowding on the cellular and regular mobile radio
 frequencies.  If the Federal Communications Commission allowed the test, AT&T
 said it would spend three years developing the system, which would allow
 customers to use the same phone and number wherever they went within a
 metropolitan area.  AT&T is in the "very early stages" of developing the
 system.

                            == USWest Profit News ==
         --------------------------------------------------------------

   Job Expenditure Tracking System (JETS) is a new engineering project
 management system that will become USWC's official capital management tool in
 July.

   JETS replaces certain job authorization processes in DOPAC, as well as the
 budgeting functions of the Construction Activity Management Information System
 (CAMIS) and joins several interelated accounting and capital spending
 functions.

   JETS is designed to work for its users, bringing faster, more efficient
 tracking of annual budgets, expenditures and administrative information for
 capital budget management, while it tracks capital and related maintenance
 dollars and dates for all classes of plant equipment.  JETS will accomplish
 this while allowing its users to track forecasted, authorized and actual
 capital dollars by job -- all within a single system.

   As an important market unit resource, JETS will allow more complete tracking
 of expenditures related to products and services.  System users will have
 direct responsibility, following conversion to JETS, for the construction
 expenditure portion of the corporate books, rather than Accounting or other
 supported personnel.  JETS also moves several other functions currently done
 in Accounting back to the users.

                == Pay-Phone Competitors say USWest is Unfair ==
              ----------------------------------------------------

   USWest Communications treats pay-phone competitors unfairly, an association
 of pay-phone businesses charges in complaint filed Wednesday with state and
 federal regulators.

   The Arizona Payphone Association, a group of 30 companies, complained to the
 state Corporation Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.

   USWest competes with other companies to install pay telephones at business
 locations where the phones are used.

   The association accuses USWest of unfair competition by charging excessive
 fees for access to the local phone network that USWest controls, and by
 offering its own pay-phone service at cut-rate prices.

   USWest has about 20,000 pay phones in Arizona and competitors have about
 4,000, the association says.

   "We are fed up with USWest using its monopoly... to create an unfair
 competitive advantage," association President Patrick Kerivan said.

   USWest Communications spokesman Tony Seese-Bieda said that the company's
 practices are not unfair, and that rates for its pay phones and rates for
 services to other pay-phone companies have been reviewed and approved by
 regulators.

                     == PAC Bell First BOC to Offer PRI ==
                   -----------------------------------------

   Pacific Bell has announced a new PRI-based ISDN service, and is the first
 Bell operating company to do so.  The company is calling the new service PRI
 IS (Integrated Systems) and provides it in two basic flavors: 23B+D and 24B.
 The service includes an array of standard and optional features. Standard
 features include unlimited intracustomer caller telephone number delivery and
 percall service selection.  Options include B-channel packet switching and
 private-facility connection.  Initially, the service will debut in two cities,
 San Francisco and Los Angeles, with other service "according to demand.  PAC
 Bell says it expects the greatest demand for the new service to services as
 WATS, 800, foreign, exchange, and private lines, or that want to use it as a
 means of interconnecting local area network.  Prices for both the 23B+D and
 24B packages are $1500 for installation and $545 per month.
