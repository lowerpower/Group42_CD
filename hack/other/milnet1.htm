<H1>Hacking The Milnet</H1>

<HR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
First of all Milnet is a system used by the Air Force and the
Pentagon for communication use. You know you are on milnet when
you see that infamous TAC login xxx. Milnet is run out of the
University of Southern California, (this might give some of you
some ideas who live around there).
<HR>

<H3>Logon Info</H3>

<P>
The Milnet number is <STRONG>1-800-368-2217</STRONG>. The ISI
MASTER DIAL UP IS <STRONG>213-306-1366</STRONG>. This is a more
tricky logon procedure but if you got balls, you're using a trunk
box, or you are just S-T-U-P-I-D here goes:
<P>
ISIE MASTER LOGON PROCEEDURE:
<OL>
<LI>call 213-306-1366
<LI>when the phone stops ringing you are connected
<LI>enter location number (9 digits) + 1 or 0
<LI>hang up and it will call you
<LI>pick up the phone and hit the '*' on your phone
<LI>hit a carriage return on the computer
<LI>at the 'what class?' prompt hit RETURN!!!
<LI>then a 'go' prompt will appear and log on as you would the
800 number.
</OL>

<H3>MILNET LOGIN PROCEEDURE</H3>

<P>
If you have trouble connecting try 300 bauds instead of 1200.
It's a bite in the ass but, sometime the connection will fuck
up if you don't.
<P>
When you first connect you will see:
<PRE>
      'WELCOME TO DDN. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. TAC LOGIN
           CALL NIC 1-800-235-3155 FOR HELP
           WRPAT TAC 113 #:36
</PRE>

<P>
(you type)@o 1/103YOU ALWAYS TYPE @o then other connections are:
<UL>
<LI>ISIA - 3/103
<LI>ISIB - 10:3/52
<LI>ISID - 10:0/27
<LI>ISIE - 1/103 (THE EXAMPLE)
<LI>ISIF - 2/103
<LI>VAX A - 10:2/27
</UL>

<HR>

<P>
Next you will see a 'USER-ID' prompt. The first 4 characters vary
but it is always followed by a '-' and what ever connection you
choose.
<PRE>
User-Id:   (example)  CER5-ISIE or MRW1-ISIE
</PRE>

<P>
The first three letters are the initials of the user followed
by a random number (1-9).
<HR>

<P>
Access Code: (example) 2285UNG6A or 22L8KK5CH
<P>
An access code will never contain a ( 1, 0, G, Z).
<P>
@ USERNAME + PASSWORD i.e. USERNAME SAC.305AREFW-LGTO
<HR>

<H3>THE USERNAME EXPLANATION:</H3>

<P>
The first 3 letters will be SAC. This stands for Strategic Air
Command. Following that is a '.' Then the squadron number and
the prime mission. In this case '305AREFW', (305TH AIR REFULING
WING). Then a '-' and the Individual Squadron name 'LGTO' (LOGISTICS
GROUND TRANSPORATION OPERATIONS), a fancy name for the motor pool.
I'll try and get a list of these there are tons of names. 
<P>
The password will not be echoed back and should be entered after
a the username. The new user password as a default is: NEW-UZER-ACNT.
