<h1>Hacking Tymnet</h1>
<em>by Silicon Rat</em>
<hr>
Tymnet is a gateway system, like Telnet.  It can be used to access
systems that might not otherwise have local numbers.  This is just a
basic file, intended for someone who has never used Tymnet before, or to
help someone who is learning to use Tymnet.<hr>
<h3>CONNECTING</h3>
  
Most Tymnet systems use the following settings:
<ul>
<li>FULL DUPLEX
<li>NO PARITY (OFF OR SPACE PARITY)
<li>1 STOP BIT
<li>MOST ARE 300/1200 BAUD
</ul>

Also, most use CONTROL-S to pause listing and CONTROL-Q to resume
listing.  CONTROL-X stop listing.  To ensure that you are allowed to
use control keys, enter CONTROL-R before telling Tymnet who you wish to
log onto.<p>

For those of you whose term is capable of sending an escape, an escape
will get you back into the [...LOG IN] area if you eber find yourself
stuck in a position where you are aout to be disconnected.
<hr>
When you first connect with Tymnet:
<pre>
      [PLEASE TYPE YOUR TERMINAL IDENTIFIER]
</pre>

will print across your screen.  Sometimes thiw will be nothing but a
bunch of garbage, which could mean that you are connected at the wrong
baud, or that your system will need an ID letter other than 'A' or 'E'. 
But for most purposes 'A' will be the ktter that wou will enter, but 'E'
is also a common ID.  However, [B,C,D,F,G,I, AND P] are also valid ID'S.<P>

Then a location number will be shown:
<pre>
      [-4004-075-]
</pre>
 After that, Tymnet will ask you to:
<pre>
      [PLEASE LOG IN.]
</pre>
You will enter the service name or initials and be sent to that serice.<br>
Example:
<pre>
  [PLEASE TYPE YOUR TERMINAL IDENTIFIER] A
  [-4004-075-]
  [PLEASE LOG IN.] IBM
</pre>
Following that precedure would send you to IBM. 
<HR>
<H3>Systems on Tymnet</H3>
Try using names or simple 3-5 character codes.  Remember, new users are
supposed to be able to use Tymnet seconds after unpacking their computer -
so think simple.<p>

Also, try getting a bunch of system names that work on Telnet, Uninet, or
Datapac and try them in Tymnet.  Try entering the name, initials, or
initials and numbers.<p>
Examples:
<pre>
DOW1   = DOW JONES, WHEN TYMNET ASKS FOR SERVICE, ENTER 'DJNS'
DOW2

CIS01  = COMPUSERVE
CIS02
CPS  

LEXIS  = LEXIS & NEXIS, WHEN IT ASKS FOR TERMINAL ID, ENTER '.LEXIS' OR
NEXIS         '.TELV950'

NEWS1  = NEWSNET

ONTYME = ONTYME (MCDONALD DOUGLAS INTERNATIONAL DATA LIBRARY)

IBM    = (WHAT ELSE?) I.B.M

ART    = HONEYWELL'S 'SYSTEM M'.

DIR.   = DIRECTORYNET.

TEL    = ??? (CONTACT ME IF YOU FIND OUT)

INDEX  = MTECH/COMMERCIAL SERVICES DIVISION.

VAX1   = UCC UCEL ON-LINE

OPER   = NET940/111

PLINK  = PEOPLE/LINK  6 CHAR ID.  9 CHAR PASSWORD.

<h3>Caution</h3>

  TYMNET SEEMS TO BE BECOMING AWARE OF HACKERS, AND CALLING THE SAME PLACE TOO
MANY TIMES IN A ROW COULD HAVE COMPLICATED RESULTS. ESPECIALLY IF YOU ONLY
GO TO 1 OR 2 DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.<p>
 TRY ALL THE ID'S UNTILL YOU FIND SEVERAL THAT WORK WITH YOUR SYSTEM, THEN
NOT ONLY CAN YOU GO TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES SO AS NOT TO ATTRACT
ATTENTION TO YOURSELF, BUT YOU CAN ENTER A DIFFERENT ID LETTER ALSO.<P>
