Section One:    The International Information Reteival Guild 
                        Meets the FBI (Part Two)

   To Clarify a few things,Let us just state we're reporting on how this
 informal gathering took place. We in NO-Way trusted this agent or
 took anything he said seriously. Several of us are former military service
 members and know the Governments Policy of DISINFORMATION.
   We're just reporting on what took place at this meeting and nothing
 more. We believe that this Agents comments should be taken for there
 entertainment value only and nothing more.

 Now on with Part II...

 FBI AGENT-I guess a senator Ribicoff back in 1979,he had the foresight to
           institute the proposed legislation in that area.
           It took them from 1979 to 1984 to finally get the bill passed,and
           out of our office there's only been two prosecutions since 1984.
           and you look at some of the reasons why and one of the biggest
           ones would be they don't want to report it. A bank doesn't want
           to report they have someone in there computer fooling around with
           all there accounts. They don't want to let people know that
           basically there money is unsafe and that at any moment there
           accounts can be all fouled up,Which usually there fouled up
           nine out of Ten times anyway.

 Anonymous-It takes a while for people to realize things are being
           manipulated, I'm a computer operator and if somebody was logging
           onto our system illegally it would be hard to find out until
           after a while.

 FBI AGENT-Thats why I alluded to the beginning,with a lot of cases it takes
           so long to figure out whats going on and then it takes even longer
           to identify the problem.
           I know in Federal Court its called the Counterfeit Access Device
           and Computer Fraud Act, thats based on illegal or unauthorized
           access to a computer that in itself is a crime because getting
           into one of the computers that has the protected items such as
           Natinal Defense,(anything along those lines) so the mere 
           accessing of those is a Federal Crime.
           The other ones go beyond that, You have to obtain information
           and you have to make a fianancial gain.
           Then the penalties are accordingly, the one regarding the Defense
           Systems and things like that carries up to a Ten year imprisonment
           and up to a Fifty Thousand Dollar Fine.
           The ones where you make a fianancial gain, your penalty is as much
           up to twice the gain you made plus up to Twenty years in Jail.
           So everything depends on whats been obtained.

           The third aspect of the crime that I guess is a watered down
           version of what Senator Ribicoff had proposed has to do with
           getting in a computer and destroying or changing different files.
           That carries with it up to a Ten year imprisonment and up to
           twice as much as the damage you caused or fianancial gain as 
           your fine.
           Then all three of those have the Conspiracy Statute thats
           attached to them where more than three people have to actually
           take part in the Conspiracy. That crime,I mean that Statute
           seems to be pretty significant.
           Like I said, Who do you have thats going to sit down all day and
           actually try to develop a case. Thats what you don't have in Law
           Enforcement right now, You don't have anyone that specifically
           looks for computer crimes, they have to be reported.
           Its not like the drug cases where you can walk right down the
           street and and find someone somewhere in the city of (DELETED)
           selling drugs. You can find that anywhere in any city.
           Its the same way as a Crime Patrol Police Officer can go
           around and find someone breaking into cars, nobody is going to
           be able to sit there and right now and justify there existence
           what would be computer crimes.
           What it takes I guess is one hand washing the other,the people
           whose computers are being accessed have got to want to come
           forward,and have to want to provide the help after they do.
           Now do I have any questions?

Knighthack- What about prosecuting Computer Piracy Violations,have there
            been any.

FBI AGENT- As towards illegaly copying software,No. They seem to be more
           concerned with theft of computer services.
           Now as far as the state level I know we've had none in our
           offices.

Anonymous- What do you mean By theft of Computer Services?

Mercenary- He means hacking into Compuserve or another pay for access
           service or using Government computers with a valid users 
           Id and password.

Old Timer-Like the young guy in California who was tying up the
          DOD's Sattelite system and bouncing his signal to Europe

FBI AGENT-Well let me ask you.. How safe do you feel our computer systems 
          are?

Knighthack- If its got a modem attached to it and its online its unsafe.

Mercenary- But of course, None of us here would do that now, Right Guys?

Whole room- Laughter

FBI AGENT-Tell me more about that California case, How did he get into
          the Department of Defense's System?

Old Timer-Apparently he hacked into the system and was an experienced
          sattelite person and figured out how to get into there
          operating system, he's serving time now It wasn't too
          publicized.

FBI AGENT- Well like I said we don't find out too much up here ourselves
           we have to watch CNN.

           
  At this Point the meeting broke into small individual talking groups
  and we departed before everyone else. We do have some documents that 
  were distributed and will be presenting those later in Upcoming issues.
  This was a meeting of a local Users group in which we were invited
  to attend by there president and would thank him here.
  Any Anonymous comments were made by a Local User and we didn't catch
  his name.

Section Two:    Hacker Information and Where to Obtain It.


    One of the most frequently asked questions the IIRG receives from the
 multitude of new day Hackers and Phreaks is where do I obtain information
 on phreaking and hacking.
    Now I don't want to get into a psychological debate on what a new day
 hacker is,but lets for safetys sake say its a kid who just got a modem
 and happened to grab a copy of Phantasy off of a bulletin board or had
 obtained another hack/phreak electronic newsletter.
    Ok,they've taken that first plunge and its wetted there appetites for
 more information. Now they run down to there local pc-mart and look
 through its racks of books and magazines and the few articles they did manage
 to find portray a hacker as a budding Charlie Manson behind a keyboard.
    Well the IIRG has had enough of these portrayals by the media and
 we've decided to assign Section 2 of every upcoming Phantasy as a brief
 article on where to obtain information for novices or the curious.
    The very first step of a curious novice would be to obtain a private mail
 box,preferably NOT a Post Office Box. There are plenty of private mail 
 services springing up and finding one close to your home should be no
 problem. These addresses are usually called Suites or just use a number.
    The price range on these boxes is usually 6 to 9 dollars a month
 and can be easily afforded even by a teenager. I said preferably NOT a
 post office box for two simple reasons, One,I distrust any government agency
 and find they cooperate very easily when they want to. And Two, if you do
 receive more "covert" mail its just a good idea not to be involed with
 any branch of the government.
    Ok,now that you've run out and gotten a mailbox you say "Well now what
 the Hell do I do with it?", Well thats a good question and an easily
 answered one,you fill it up son!
    Now the very first thing we suggest is laying aside some serious cash
 or hitting up the slush fund for your expenses. Because expenditures for
 hacking information aren't cheap and especially figuring this after what
 you've probably spent on your equipment.
    We're not saying that all these books or equipment are needed
 for your library,there just nice to have around.

  We advise sending for these Books:

 Well That should cover the basics,like I said some of the catalogs you'll
 go crazy over,theres always something for everyone in them.
 But now onto more books and magazines,

  Go down to your local book store and look these titles up,or have them
  order them for you..

     1. Old but good reading- Out of the Inner Circle by Bill Landreth
                               1985 by Microsoft Press $9.95

     2. Hackers by Steve Levy- A good guide for the Ethics of a hacker..
        Dell Publishing Company 1984 $4.50

     3. The Cuckoos Egg by Clifford Stoll
        Originally out in hardback at $19.95,but at the time of the
        editing of this article its now in the stores on paperback
        (Story of the Hannover Hacker and his ultimate downfall)

     4. Definitly and an absolute must,Subscribe to:

           2600:The Hackers Quarterly
           Call (516)-751-2600,or FAX line (516)-751-2608

   There are many more worthwhile books and magazines that could be listed
 on and on, But we feel these selections will present to you a good
 broad range of topics and interests. Some other worthy footnotes would be
 to look up Consumertronics,they offer a large but expensive listing of
 hacker/phreaker related material,(ED NOTE-Call (505)-434-0234) and to
 find a bbs that has a large selection of Hacker Text files such as
 PHANTASY,PHRACK,CUD,ATI etc. The IIRG's BBS along with many others offer
 these files and finding them is no real difficulty.
  This should drain your checkbook effectively for a while,or at least till
 next months article on what is useful and noteworth on your newly obtained
 hacker library.

 Section 3: High Explosives for Fun and Profit!
            By:(Name withheld by Request)

 EDITORS NOTE:The Procedures discussed in this article are
              extremely dangerous. Therefore,the Author and
              publisher (The IIRG) disclaim any liability
              from any damages or injuries of any type that the
              reader or user of information contained within
              this article may encounter from the use of said
              information. This article is intended for
              entertainment purposes only!

   Since Hacking is truly a state of mind and a Hacker can branch his
 talents into many fields,I present this article to you on the God given
 rights of this country and my constitutional right of Freedom of speech.
   Ever since a lazy summer day in the Maine backwoods,spent blowing off
 fireworks with my father and uncle,I've had a true love for explosives
 of almost any type. A six year stint in the Marines only further
 encouraged this love of noise.
    What I present here to you are some well known formulas with
 a sprinkle of my own modifications.
    This first formula will allow you to concoct roughly the equivalent
 of dynamite,not a military grade explosive but a great fishing bait!

  First obtain some Potassium Chlorate, a rather cheap and easy to
  acquire chemical usually obtainable at any chmeical distributor.
  If they ask you what you need it for,do what I do and claim your
  picking it up for your company and have no idea,the boss just sent
  you to get it. I have this routine down pat and even stick around
  with the owner of the warehouse and have coffee. If they really
  are curious claim its for Hydroponics experiments.

  Now take the KC1O3 (Potassium Chlorate) and grind it into a fine powder
 almost the rough equivalent of flour or talcum powder. This is a must!

  Carefully measure 5 level teaspoons of Vaseline and place in a plastic
 bowl with 5 level teaspoons of beeswax. Then pour 1/3 of a cup of white
 gas (Coleman liquid fuel) and dissolve the wax and vaseline mixture.

  Now take 90 premeasured level teaspoons of powdered KC1O3 and hand knead
 it into the bowl and form into blocks as the mixture hardens or place in
 cardboard rolls (towel or toilet paper) and seal with wax.

  Your explosive is now done but requires a blasting cap to set it off
 and since these are almost impossible to obtain legally,here a do it 
 yourself cap.

  Get some .25 ID (inner diameter) aluminum tubing at the old
  hardware store

  get some hexamine tablets down at the old military surplus shop
  and grind into a fine powder like the above KC1O3

  Take 2 1/2 tablespoons of crushed hexamine and mix with 4 1/2 tablespoons
  of Citric acid (available at most grocery stores) in a glass jar
  mix well with stirring rod and add 1 tablespoon of 20-30% peroxide
  and place jar in a cool spot for 12 hours
  Run mixture through a coffee filter,pour rubbing alcohol over mix in filter
  (four or five spoons worth),to clean mix.
  Let powder dry on towel and prepare tube,

   Crimp one end of tube ( 3 1/2 inces long total)
   fill tube with powder and place very thin wire into mix in tube
   or a model rocket igniter,seal with glue and allow to dry.

  Ok,take your homemade cap,place into your main charge and run
  about 50 feet of wire from fuse to a 12 volt battery
  When its all clear hook up your juice (Voltage) and kiss that
  charge goodbye.
  Some of my favorites are blasting for fish,make sure charge is totally
  watertight in this case or blasting out old stumps.
  JUST BE CAREFUL,The CAPS are EXTREMELY SHOCK SENSITIVE and are
  powerful enough to blow your hand off.

  Have Phun,and be careful. I had a blast for sure!

 Section 3: The I.I.R.G. Attends the 8th Annual Connecticut
                   Computer and Electronics Show
                            By:Mercenary


  On November 7th the I.I.R.G. Attended the 8th Ct. CES show,
 The show seemed to be smaller than last year but the IIRG picked through
 the venders booths with the zeal of drowning men looking for a life preserver.
  Vagabond spent a large portion of his time dealing with a SNET 
 represenative discussing the workings of the CONN-NET system but was
 able to get some valuable information from some other venders as well
 which we'll present in this article. 
  Knighthack seemed to have a good laugh when the Prodigy demonstraters
 couldn't seem to get on the system. (P.S.-He had to show em how)
  Myself,well I sat through the Intro to Lans Seminar and the Wiring
 your Network Seminar but couldn't take any more after that.
  Heres what we were able to dig up at the show though,

 1. Intergrated Services Digital Network Applications in the
                         Army Environment

    It seems that the U.S. army is trying to develop specific end user
 applications which solely depend upon the ISDN technologies of the Army.
    The ARMY has identitfied the ISDN as part of the communications
 archetectures of the future. Extensive field trials of ISDN have been
 conducted to demonstrate the potential benefits of such technology.
    But the limited number of user applications has prevented the
 full realization of such services.


 2. It seems the NAVY is concentrating on Computer Security Problems in
   a BIG way. We saw 8 specific Computer Security projects laid out for
   developers.

      2A-High Assurance Trusted Systems-Seems there investigating
         new approches for achieving high assurance for trusted systems
         that accomadate innovative designs.
      2B-Characteristics of Processing Elements with Respect to
         Multilevel Security.
      2C-Security Features for Work-Stations-seems they want better
         techniques.
      2D-Technology to Establish and Support the Role of Man in
         Computer Security Systems.
      2E-Expert System for Multilevel Security.
      2F-The Inference Problem in Multilevel Secure database Management
         systems.
      2G-Placement of Network Security Services for Secure Data Exchange
      2H-Composibility Constraints Of Multilevel Secure Systems

MIT'S ATHENA TECHNOLOGY

MAYNARD, Mass."Athena," the innovative
computing environment developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT), will be up and running at two new campuses this
winter.

North Carolina State University (NCSU) and Iowa State University
(ISU) signed contracts totaling $7 million with Digital
Equipment Corporation to install the Athena systems software and
link together hundreds of Digital workstations.

On each campus, the result will be a large-scale, high-
performance network designed to support students, faculty, and
researchers using UNIX based systems.

"Athena offers a new model for managing large numbers of workstations
in a network," said Barry Braunstein, Digital manager of Research
and Science/Engineering Solutions in the Education Market.
"Computing resources are centrally managed and highly accessible
to users completely location independent. Users can walk up to
any workstation on the network and log on, and access the same
files, software, and electronic mail."

Athena software services developed at MIT are freely redistributable.
Digital is offering support in planning, installation, and staff
training to universities who want to adopt the system.

At Iowa State, the Athena environment will include users from
engineering, the sciences, and a variety of other disciplines.  "The
initial focus of the project is to stimulate high-quality research
by putting powerful tools into the hands of our faculty and graduate
students," said George Strawn, Director of Iowa State's Computation
Center.
                                                                   
Strawn said that researchers will benefit from speed and
power of workstations, and from the 'visualization' of research
data, which is made possible by computer graphics, things not
previously available in their existing computing environment.

The network will also make it easier to connect to off-campus
resources such as the National Science Foundation's supercomputers.

At North Carolina State University, the network's primary
function is to support engineering education.

"In the `real world,' computers are an integral part of engineering,"
said William Willis, Director of Engineering Computing Operations.
"Yet there's no consistent exposure to computers in the
undergraduate curriculum. Our goal is to ensure that a new
generation of students is comfortable using these modern tools."

This fall, only freshmen engineering students will use the
Athena environment.  Over time, all engineering students will use
the workstations for design projects, simulation and modeling,
sharing data, writing papers, and solving homework problems.

Braunstein explained that Project Athena resolved many
technical problems that had made it expensive and technically
difficult to manage UNIX workstations in a network.  Two key areas
were system security and the cost of network management.

"Athena's `Kerberos' network authentication system ensures a
very high level of security," said Braunstein. "And the automated
`Moira' Service Management System makes it possible to deploy a
large number of workstations in a cost-effective way, using a
client-server model, under central management.

"Cost-conscious institutions can support a large-scale
environment with a relatively small staff. For example, MIT runs an
installation of 1,000-plus workstations with a staff of six people
in hardware operations and systems administration"

Both NCSU and ISU had similar reasons for choosing to work with
Digital.  Strawn explained, "Iowa State has a long relationship with
Digital, dating back to the 1960s. For this project, Digital
workstations offered excellent price/performance, and Digital's
proposal was the most innovative in terms of the Athena software."

Dr. Willis said, "In implementing the Athena technology, NCSU
was really looking for a partner. We reviewed three excellent
proposals. But Digital had much more experience with Athena and
has much stronger educational programs."

 A STEALTH MODEM

  No,we've not been staring at the CRT too long,it seems that the
 Air Force is trying to develop a Tactical Modem for Stealth Communications.
  The Trend towards intelligent jamming mandates demands that future tactical
