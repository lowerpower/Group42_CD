 Section [2]: Explosive Bullets
              Article Written By: Saint Anarchy


    Greetings fellow anarchists and hackers. This bullet is an explosive type
   of bullet, but not in the technical sense which would make it illegal.
    This bullet contains no real explosives, but never the less it explodes
   with equal the violence as if it did contain them.
     It can be used in all calibers, both in rifles and handguns.

     Before we undertake this little project, I'd like to state that in no
    way do I condone the use of this type of bullet, but provide it here in
    this periodical for your enlightenment and entertainment only.
     Some old timers have used this bullet for years, especially Cajuns and
    some more of the radical elements in the United States and abroad.

     The secret of this bullet is WATER, yes H20, But how can water make a
    bullet explode you ask? Simply put, when an ordinary lead or soft point
    bullet type enters tissue, the tissue builds up in front of the nose,
    pushing the nose rearward causing the lead to mushroom.
     The less pointed the nose and the greater the velocity, the greater the
    mushrooming effect. With a hollow-point bullet, a certain amount of soft
    tissue enters the hollow and causes expansion, but not much can enter
    because of the cushion of air trapped in the hollow. But in the bullet we
    will create, it works on the principle of hydraulics.
     Water is incompressible and according to physical laws, when it is
    trapped in a container and pressure is exerted on any portion of it, that
    same pressure is exerted on the inside surface of the container.
     If you have a glass bottle completely filled with water with no trapped
    air and you tryed to stopper it by tapping in the glass stopper with your
    hand, you could shatter the container.
     Lets say the bottom area of the glass stopper is one square inch in
    surface area and you tap it with a force of two pounds. The inside surface
    may have an area of one hundred square inches. This means that the total
    expanding force exerted on the inside surface of the bottle is 200 pounds!
     The force on the gas-check in the bullet upon impact is also transmitted
    undiminished to every portion of the inside surface of the hollow.
    The result is enough force for the bullet to literally explode!!!
    But since the nose is hollow-pointed, only the nose of the bullet will
    explode. The main body of the bullet continues to penetrate as a lead
    cylinder.
     I must explain however, that the hollow point isn't the usual size.
    Experiments have shown that in order to obtain sufficient hydraulic
    pressure, the diameter of the cavity must be 38% or 40% of the bullet
    diameter. The depth of the cavity does not control the rate of expansion,
    it simply determines the degree of explosion. Obviously a deeper cavity
    means more internal surface which the impact pressure can use, and
    therefore a greater explosion with a greater portion of the bullet being
    disintegrated.
     It is generally considered that the fragmentation of a bullet is
    undesireable because its energy is wasted in its disintegration and there
    can be no further penetration of tissue except by small particles of the
    bullet held together and mushroomed until it stops moving. All its
    kinetic energy would be exausted against the tissue covering an area
    approximately the size of the mushroom.
     This bullet is different in that it penetrates first and then
    disintegrates violently from internal pressures, like a bomb!! Creating its
    own shock-wave which affects all tissue in the immediate area.
     One of the nice features about this bullet is that it's a home-brew,
    The principle items you need are a special bullet mold in the caliber of
    your gun, with an extra large hollow-point, a gas checker, and an
    eye-dropper.
     Theres no trick to making the bullet, its cast in the usual way.
    the water is added with the eye-dropper to completely fill the hollow
    point cavity. The gas-checker, with its concave side outward, is then
    seated over the water with a punch of a bullet lubricator-sizer.
    Since the gas-check is over-sized, it seals the the water filled cavity
    like the cap on a bottle.
     Now some of you may not have a re-loader, dies, and molds. Your saying
    "OK what about me?". Well heres a quick fix for you.
    Purchase a box of hollow points in your caliber. Enlarge the cavity with
    a round file or use a taper like myself.
    Fill the cavity with water, (I prefer to use a needle for this), stolen
    from my local Dr. on my last visit.
    Then seal the hollow with silicon or preferably teflon and allow to dry.
     Its not as good as the molded type but works 1/2 as well.

   Some quick Notes:

    The bullet will only work on fleshy material, (Humans, animals, watermelons)
    It will not work if shot at a rock, board, wall or police cruiser.
    Have phun folks!!

 Section [6]: Installing a Smoke Screen on your Vehicle
              Written By: Saint Anarchy

   The plans for my smoke screen will work especially well on older vehicles
 and moderately well on newer vehicles. On some cars, you will be unable to
 install this device.

   [1] Obtain the nozzle of a paint sprayer.

   [2] Drill a hole in the exhaust manifold about the size of the nozzle.

   [3] Weld the nozzle in place, attach a length of gas line to it.

   [4] Take the length of gas line and run it up to your drivers compartment

   [5] Hook up the spray container after you've filled it with CASTOR OIL,
       to the gas line you just ran up

   [6] When you need the smoke screen, send the oil to the nozzle, the manifold
       will heat it creating a thick dense cloud of black smoke making
       pursuit of your vehicle almost impossible.

  FBI Agent Steve Sterrit, legal adviser to the FBI in Las Vegas, annonced that
 the agency was actively investigating those who oppose Bush's war in the
 Middle East.
  The inquiry was launched after a complaint by Abraham Foxman, national
 director of the Anti-Defamation Leauge (ADL). In a statement issued in N.Y.,
 the ADL complained the Anti-war movement "is a brazen attempt to dishearten
 and create a disunity among American troops". The ADL is the largest Israeli
 lobby in the US. Foxman further requested Secretary of Defense Richard B.
 Cheney to "identify and intercept" letters to american serviceman that oppose
 the Middle East War.

 IIRG NOTE: We here at the IIRG have only THree Things to State on this
            topic of interest.

 DIGITAL ANNOUNCES INTEGRATED SECURITY PROGRAM

MAYNARD, Mass. -- November 30, 1990 -- Digital Equipment Corporation
today announced an Integrated Security Program, which formalizes the
corporation's commitment to information security and an integrated
security architecture for distributed, multi-vendor systems.

Digital's announcement introduces a series of security
enhancements that package security technology for single systems,
local area networks, and management services to assist organizations
implement effective security controls.

"Security is a critical issue for many organizations as they
migrate to new information technology," said Digital Vice President
Harvey L. Weiss. "This program establishes Digital as the leader in
providing security products and capabilities to address expanding
information systems environments."

"We believe it is the 'management' of security technology - not
the technology itself - which is the key to providing computer
security for customers," Weiss said. "Digital now provides customers
with the best technology, comprehensive service and training to help
manage this technology and make it truly effective."

In support of its corporate commitment to help customers
implement and manage enterprise-wide secure solutions, Digital
announced major enhancements to its Integrated Security Program
which include:

    o  Major additions to VMS password management - to deter attacks
       based on guessing user or system account passwords.

    o  New management features in the Ethernet Enhanced-Security
       System  - providing node authentication, access control and
       encryption in a multi-vendor environment LAN.

    o  The development of a Compartmented Mode Workstation (CMW)
       designed to be evaluated at the B1 and CMW level of trust.
       CMW is based on RISC and VAX architecture, ULTRIX operating
       system and X-Windows/MOTIF.

    o  The availability, through Digital, of Sybase's Secure SQL
       Server - a Multi-Level Secure RDBMS software for VAX ULTRIX
       systems.

    o  Digital's Distributed System Security Architecture (DSSA)- a
       comprehensive specification for implementing information
       security in a distributed, multi-vendor environment.

    o  The creation of a Secure Solutions Integration Center

       - to provide security consulting and solution design.

    o  The availability of Next Step Services     VMS Security

       - a packaging of security courses and consulting to train a
         customer's Information Systems organization.

The new integrated security products, capabilities and services
are designed to allow customers to choose the levels of security
appropriate for their applications and organizations while
maintaining systems investments. In addition, Digital also has a
program to encourage software vendors to develop complementary
security products.

The program addresses such things as: verification of identity
of systems and users; integrity of software and data shared across
networks, and provides confidentiality for sensitive information
stored or transmitted across networks.

By taking advantage of the integrated security controls in VMS,
ULTRIX, DECnet/OSI, Rdb/VMS and Secure SQL database software,
Digital customers can reduce training time required to install
security measures.  Digital's participation in the National Computer
Security Center (NCSC) security evaluation program guarantees a high
level of assurance that the security controls in VMS are effective.

In the open systems environment, Digital has undertaken several
R & D initiatives to provide security for ULTRIX systems, Digital's
UNIX-based operating system. ULTRIX already has features designed
to meet NCSC's C2 requirements.

Digital is also developing a Compartmented Mode Workstation
(CMW) based upon RISC and VAX architecture, ULTRIX and X-Windows/
MOTIF for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). This workstation is
designed to meet the NCSC's B1 and DIA's CMW security requirements
for multi-level workstation.

"It is important for customers to understand that it is easier
to manage security when the basic security co     s are part of the
system," Weiss said. "The new program combines Digital's basic built
in security products with a comprehensive set of security services,"
he added.

Digital Equipment Corporation, headquartered in Maynard,
Massachusetts, is the leading worldwide supplier of networked
computer systems and services.  Digital offers a full range of
computing solutions and systems integration for the entire
enterprise -- from the desktop to the data center.

  Vail, Colorado.- A Secret Service Agent assigned to Vice-President
 Dan Quayle was arrested for shoplifting after allegedly trying to steal a
 ski jacket.
  Secret Service Agent Joyce Fletcher, 39 of Washington was released after
 posting bond. Police said Fletcher was arrested after allegedly stuffing the
 jacket into a shopping bag in a changing room.
  Allan Cramer, a Secret Service agent in Vail, said the Agency would begin
 an internal investigation of the incident.

 IIRG NOTE: Gee, no wonder the Secret Service wants to bust innocent
            hackers and confiscate equipment. They're probably selling
            the stuff out a backdoor of there headquarters and using
            the profits to run there illicit drug-smuggling operation.
            Oh well, divert attentions away from your own I guess...
