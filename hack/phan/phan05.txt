 Section [1]: OK, Where the Hell Have We Been ?

   Here's a Quick overview of what happened to the I.I.R.G. over the last
  eleven months since our last issue.
   Well for starters, Lets disclaim a few rumors I've heard over the lines,

  1. NO, we didn't get busted for any reason and I can't think of any
     reason why we should have.
  2. NO, I didn't blow myself up trying one of the Saints recipes, That
     rumor was started by Knight Hack as an excuse for his own inactivity.
  3. YES, I was tired and needed a rest - I just took too long of one.

   Well now that the rumor mongering is done lets discuss what really
  happened, As many of you already know - The Rune Stone BBS is gone,
  I just got tired of running it for the group.
   The quality of Hackers has greatly diminished in the last year. To Tell
  the truth many of our peers have sold out for money. The new attitude
  seems to be "CONSULTING", oh God How I have come to hate that word.
   Hell, I like money just as much as the next person, but some of you
  out there have forgotten where you came from!
   Mostly what we were getting on the board was your standard collection
  of codez kidz, and warez leeches. I really didn't mind this but it gets
  tiring after a while. I would like to Thank You folks from Mass,NY,and
  the 414 Area. They were the real contributors and benefactors and I
  won't mention names but you know who you are.
   As for the rest of the year, I spent it goofing off in general.
  April was Fishing,June was Drinking,Sept to Nov was Hunting.
   There really isn't too much to tell, I guess I was Just a lazy bastard.
  But know Im back, and the groups waking up for the winter and as you may
  have noticed, I did take Monthly out of the Header but may replace it if
  we can hit issue 12 without skipping a month.
   So grab a can of Jolt, an order of General Tso's Chicken, and a
   2 liter Dessert of Mountain Dew and join us for the ride.

    Now I'm not saying you have to buy the Radio Shack phone, it just has
   the features you will want, We grab ours at computer shows for $5.00
   you may have a phone or can get it cheaper, Just get one with Re-dial,
   Ringer on/off,switchable tone/pulse--You'll be glad you did in the long
   run.

   CONSTRUCTION:

   1. Take the Mod To Mod, Pick a desired length from one end,
      (We use 1 foot 2 inches) and cut the wire.
   2. Now Carefully take a razor blade or knife and strip back two
      inches of the gray wire covering, MAKING SURE NOT TO CUT
      OR DAMAGE THE 4 WIRES INSIDE!!
   3. Strip 1/4 inch covering off the GREEN and RED WIRE
   4. You can either cut off the yellow and black or bend them back
      for future use (We cut ours since you'll have enough left
      over to make more)
   5. Put Proper Size shrink tubing over wire down on to gray covering
   6. Take the Green Alligator Clip, Solder the Green wire to the Green Clip
   7. Take The Red Clip, Solder the Red wire to the Red Clip
   8. Bring shrink tubing back up to cut end, place just over gray material
      (1/4 Inch) and shrink with heat gun or hair dryer
   9. Place Inline coupler on mod end of Gray cord, attach other end of
      coupler to white wire mod end of phone.
  10. Pat yourself on Back, you're done.

    Now with our Beige Box, to use the Phone like normal just take off
   inline coupler and plug phone in jack like normal.
    To use it as a Beige Box, you just hook up coupler to phone and take
   your trusty 7/16 Inch Hex driver (Available at Hardware Store,Sears,Caldors,
   K-Mart,Got the Idea Yet?) And open up your local Green Tower or switcher
   Hook Red Clip to "R" Ring terminal and Green Clip to "T" Tip terminal
   and listen for Dial tone.
    This is great for apartment buildings,condos,and hotels where
   junction boxes are easily available on side of building or basements.
    For more Hints on Uses, Read Exterminators and Terminal Mans File.
   Note: Some junction boxes will be locked and cannot be opened with
         7/16 Hex Driver, Don't forget your lockpicks.

 Section [4]: Tip on Telephone Privacy I
              Written By: TESLA

    Your home style single line telephone can easily become a "Hot Mike"
   in the hands of a skilled technician. Hot Mikes are capable of picking up
   conversations in the area while the handset is still in the cradle,
   (Still on the hook) without affecting normal operation of the phone.
    Unless you (or a friend) is a trained electronics or telephone
   technician, it is doubtful that you will notice any modifications made
   to your phone even if it has been turned into a Hot Mike Set, because
   nothing is added to the phone,and nothing is removed.
   The modification simply requires the technician to change the position
   of two wires inside the phone,taking only seconds from start to finish.
   Some phones come with this modification already made, allowing phones to
   be monitored at the nearest punch-down junction (phone box) without the
   worry of having to enter the home.
    The simplest way to defeat an attempt to Hot Mike your home or office
   is to dissconnect the Black and Yellow Wires where your phone plugs
   into the wall.
    Some of the newly installed phone lines use white wires with blue
   tracers and white wires with orange tracers. In these cases, remove
   both orange-white wires from the mounting block.
    Whether you have a modular (Plug in) or hard wired telephone,touch
   tone or rotary, the process is the same.
    NOTE: Disconnecting these wires on a multi-line phone may disconnect
   one of your numbers, so use this method only with single line sets.
    CAUTION: Remove the handset from the cradle (Take phone off hook)
   before touching any wires. Ring voltages on the ring and tip
   (red/green or blue/white) wires can be excessive if someone tries
   to call while your working.

 Section [5]: Tip on Telephone Privacy II
              Written By: TESLA

    Many people are aware of government telephone taps and other methods
   of listening in on private telephone conversations, though few are aware
   that private citizens, with the minimum of equipment and skill can do
   exactly the same thing, and it is legal.
    Those who own home satellite dishes can easily receive signals from
   satellites which contain the microwaved conversations of thousands of
   long distance callers. The satellite dish owner simply has to scan the
   various satellites and transponders until he comes across a channel with
   "dead-air", or a blank soundless screen. This is an indication that the
   transponder channel may be used for carrying data or telephone
   conversations.
    Once the proper satellite and transponder are located, the eavesdropper
   runs an antenna line (Shielded, of course) from the video output of the
   downconverter (necessary for all home satellite reception) to the antenna
   input of a standard highband scanner. Once the scanner is placed into the
   "scan" mode, the scanner will stop scanning every time it detects a signal
   (telephone conversation). The listener simply has to scan the entire range
   of the band, and stop on any conversation that he feels like listening to.
    In addition to scanners (which can be purchased anywhere from a hundred,
   to thousands of dollars),one may also use a shortwave radio for the same
   purpose. The connections are all the same.
    While the average eavesdropper may not be able to locate a specific
   conversation (intentionally),experienced persons may be able to pinpoint
   a specific conversation by knowing where the call is being placed from,
   and to, in advance. This allows the listener to determine the exact
   routing that the call will take (Which satellite,which transponder).
    Because of recent court rulings which declare that the airwaves are
   public domain, and that the monitoring of frequencies used by mobile and
   other type of cellular telephones does not constitute an invasion of
   privacy, satellite monitoring is not considered illegal. In fact,
   it is suspected that several law enforcement agencies (with the assistance
   of telephone companies) are using these tactics to gather evidence rather
   than obtaining a court order for a traditional wiretap.
    With all the privacy invasion tactics that can be used by the government,
   as well as private citizens, one should be very conservative as to what
   forms of communications are used, and where.
    Never say anything on a telephone that you wouldn't yell out in a
   shopping mall.

 Section [6]: Nicotine Sulfate
              Written By: Saint Anarchy

    This is one of the most lethal poisons available to the anarchist at
   large. It is an insect poison found under several names.
   The most common is "Black Leaf 40" and can be purchased or stolen from
   any well stocked garden or discount store.
    This stuff is 40% Nicotine Sulfate, just a few drops in any drink is
   undetectable and will kill very quickly,usually within a few minutes.
    The best way we've found to obtain the Nicotine Sulfate is by evaporation.
   This should be done until the mixture is like a thin syrup and forms into
   drops when put in a medicine dropper.
    One of the glories of Nicotine Sulfate is that it is absorbed by the
   skin and is fatal within minutes. Death by Nicotine sulfate can only be
   detected by someone taking a blood test. This is seldomn given unless the
   autopsy has been ordered when foul play is suspected.
    A fine way to use Nicotine Sulfate is to carry it in a soft drink cup
   and act like you accidently spilled it on your intended victim.
   If he or she doesn't wash it off within a matter of seconds, the person
   will be dead in a matter of minutes. There is very little chance of
   the victim being able to wash it off if he or she doesn't realize what
   it is. If they try to rub it off, it will be absorbed into the skin
   all that much sooner.

                  Provided By: The Digital Online System

Many software modules develped for the MIT Athena Project have been accepted by
the Open Software Foundation (OSF), so the products based on them carry the
insurance of open-systems industry standards.

The success of MIT with Project Athena has been noted, and the distributed
network emulated at other universities, among them Iowa State University, the
University of North Carolina, Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology, and
Australia's Bond University.

Several of Digital's commercial customers also saw the potential for managing
their own distributed workstations, and purchased Digital's implementation of
the new technology.

Two such companies are SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, a division of a
transnational healthcare organization headquartered in Great Britain, and
Eastman Kodak Company, the photographic goods manufacturer based in Rochester,
New York.

 Dateline: 12-5 DIGITAL WINS AWARD FROM LOCKHEED
           Provided By: The Digital Online System

MAYNARD, Mass. -- December 5, 1991 -- Digital Equipment Corporation
announced today the winning of a multimillion dollar award from
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company to deliver a comprehensive
software engineering solution for the development of systems
software for the F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter project. The F-22
will be the newest entry into the U.S. Air Forces's stable of
fighter aircraft. The initial award, totaling $8.5 million in
hardware, software, and services, represents the first in an
anticipated series involving the Lockheed F-22 team.

Lockheed ASC, teamed with General Dynamics Fort Worth Division
and Boeing Defense and Space Group's Military Airplanes Company, was
selected by the U.S. Air Force to develop the F-22 Advanced Tactical
Fighter to replace the aging F-15 Eagle as the superiority fighter
of the future. As the future vanguard weapon in America's air
defense arsenal, the F-22's design goal for all areas calls for a
100 percent improvement over the F-15.

Digital's recently announced COHESION ASD/SEE (Aerospace-
Defense/Software Engineering Environment) is the basis for Digital's
selection to provide the software development environment to the
F-22 team.  The COHESION ASD/SEE solution will be used to develop
the several million of lines of Ada software code required by the
aircraft's systems.  COHESION ASD/SEE is a component of Digital's
COHESION set of integrated software products and services for
computer-aided software engineering (CASE).

The award signals government recognition of Digital's intent to
support the COHESION ASD/SEE environment throughout the lifecycle of
the F-22 project, which could extend up to 30 years.

According to Martin Hoffmann, Digital Vice President and
General Counsel, "The widespread use of VAX VMS in government
applications, the certified DEC Ada programming language, and the
capabilities of the COHESION software development environment all
contributed to Digital's selection to provide the environment for
the F-22 project."

Jack MacKeen, Digital Vice President, Government Systems,
added, "The COHESION ASD/SEE solution was designed to address the
increasing number of critical business and technical challenges the
aerospace defense industry faces in developing and integrating
software for mission critical systems."

Digital's COHESION integrated solution for computer-aided
software engineering is a comprehensive set of products and services
that provides an evolving unified environment in which to develop,
deploy, manage, and maintain all types of software. Based on
Digital's Network Application Support (NAS) architecture and
designed for both VMS and UNIX platforms, the COHESION environment
brings together multiple computing platforms, vendors, tools,
application types, computing styles and support services for
development project of all sizes.

VMS, VAX and COHESION are trademarks of Digital

 Section [8]: End of Year Comments
              Written By: Mercenary

     Well, so much for 1991. Two whole Issues for the year.
    As for 1992 We hope to release each issue on the last day of the month
     Phantasy is looking for writer of ORIGINAL articles for each Issue
    Contact me on any of the Listed Distribution nodes to arrange your
    article submission. Since the Rune Stone is down articles may be
    mailed to us at our private mail box, mail a disk 360 or 1.2
    and we'll return it with the Newest Issue of Phantasy.

                      THE I.I.R.G.
                      862 Farmington Ave Suite 306
                      Bristol,CT. 06010

    I hope everyone has a happy holiday season and a prosperous
   new year, With the recession and eventual depression I know
   some of us will be hard hit.
    Of course the Government see's fit to waste huge amounts
   of money on foreign aid. Come on Congress, help the United States
   not a bunch of third world trash.
    Lets see the United States take our technological lead in the
   world back from Japan, Lets the Soviets rot in Hell.... I'd like to
   quote Dimitry Manuliski, an instructor at the Lenin school of
   political warfare in Moscow, 61 years ago in 1930 he said....

   "War between communism and capitalism is inevitable, Today (1930),
    of course, we are not strong enough to attack. Our time will come in
    30 or 40 years. To win, we shall need the element of surprise.
    The western World will have to be put to sleep, So we shall begin
    by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record. There
    shall be electrifying overtures and unheard of concessions. The
    capitalist countries, stupid and decadent, will rejoice to
    cooperate in their own destruction. They will leap at another chance
    to be friends. As soon as their guard is down, we shall smash them
    with our clenched fist"

   Sounds quite a bit like whats going on now, huh folks?
   So for 1992 I'd say lets all collectivly watch our butts, lets not
  let our guard down. The hacking community right now is in the
  lime-light of attention, and the government has seen fit to try to
  wipe out our spokesman and fore-runners.
   Of course ignorance is a fact of life in Washington,DC.
  Anything that cannot be controlled or dominated is a threat to them
  and by God lets stay free men from both our enemies, Foreign and
  Domestic.

                        Mercenary - Dec 7,1992
                        Sort of Ironic isn't it
