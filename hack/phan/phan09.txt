 Section [1]: A Bill to Be Entitled An Act.
              By: Author Unknown


  There has been much ado of late about the need for model legislation. If any
 proposed law fufills this need, it is the one reproduced in this article.
  A Georgia statute for hunting wildlife has been revised to target the most
 carnivorous and vicious of animals - Secret Service Agents - .
  The Bill, the brainchild osf some wise and progressive Georgians, has not
 and never will be introduced in the Georgia Legislature, But it Should!!


                        A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT

 To amend Part 1 of Article 1 of Chapter 3 of Title 27 of the Official Code
 of Georgia Annonated, relating to general provisions applicable to hunting
 wildlife, so as to provide for hunting Secret Service Agents, to provide
 for certain restrictions, to provide for related matters, to repeal
 conflicting laws, and for other purposes.

            BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:

 Section 1. Part 1 of Article 1 of Chapter 3 of Title 27 of the Official Code
 of Georgia Annotated, relating to general provisions applicable to hunting
 wildlife, is amended by inserting immediately following Code Section 27-3-25
 a new Code Section 27-3-26 to read as follows:

 27-3-26 (A) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any person

             provisions of Code Section 27-3-2 may hunt or trap Secret Service
             Agents,FBI Agents, or any Employee of the SPA for recreational
             noncommercial purposes, subject to the following:

  [1] The Taking of SS,FBI,SPA Agents by deadfall is permitted; provided that
      the use of currency as bait is tantamount to shooting on a baited field
      and is prohibited.
  [2] The Killing of SS,FBI,SPA agents with a vehicle is prohibited, provided,
      however that such limitation shall not apply to golf carts.
      If accidentally struck, dead agents shall be removed from the right of
      way and the afflicted vehicle taken to the nearest car wash.
  [3] It shall be unlawful to attract SS,FBI,SPA Agents for hunting purposes
      with calls of "PHANTASY","PHRACK", or "FREE SCOTCH" or the use of any
      device mimicking the sight and sound of a Bulletin Board.
  [4] It shall be unlawful to chase,herd, or harvest Agents from an air boat,
      helicopter, or aircraft.
  [5] It shall be unlawful to hunt Agents within 100 yards of a strip bar,
      whore house,or retailer of sunglasses; Including without limitation
      on Wednesday afternoons.
  [6] It shall be unlawful to hunt agents within 200 yards of courtrooms,
      law libraries,health spas,golf courses,computer stores, or hackers
      conference.

      purposes of enticing Agents for hunting purposes.

      hunting Agents.

 Section 2. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are repealed.

  It is worthy of observation,that the most imperious masters of their own
  servants,are at the same time, the most abject slaves to the servants of
  other masters.

 Section [3]: Comic Book Review "The Hacker Files"
              Review By: Anubis

  DC Comics has just started publishing a new 12 part mini-series comic about
 computer hackers named, "The Hacker Files",the "A" in hacker is drawn as the
 Anarchy symbol "A",we thought this was a great touch to the cover.
  Writer and creator of the comic is Lewis Shiner, with pencils by Tom Sutton,
 and inks by Mark Buckingham.
  The Series is called "SoftWar 1.0" and the plot idea isn't bad but the story
 does stray away from reality in the hardware department.
  The basic idea of the Plot so far is an aging hacker named Jack Marshall is
 brought in as an emergency consultant for the Pentagon as they've been
 infected by a computer virus.
  Standing in Jacks way are the standard red tape of the government as well
 as his former employer and manufacturer of the computers used in the story,
 "Digitronix".
  Helping Jack with his quest are "The Speed Metal Kids" a group of younger
 hackers potrayed as your stereotypical computer nerds.
  Issues number 1 and 2 are out as of this articles writing and we'd
 recommend you add this series to your files.
  So far except for some typical type-casting, hackers are potrayed in a
 positive light, we hope this trend continues.
  On a scale of 1 to 10, We'd give the story a 6 so far.

 Section [4]: CAFFEINE: Hackers Drug of Choice or Divine Miracle
              By: Saint Anarchy


  Caffeine is an alkaloid, a class of naturally occuring compounds containing
 nitrogen and having the properties of an organic amine base. (alkaline,hence,
 alkaloid).
  Most people ingest caffeine in some form of beverage, mainly Coffee,Tea,or
 soda. The orgins of coffee and tea are so old that they are lost in legend.
  Coffee is said to have been discovered by an Abyssinian goatherder who
 noticed an unusual friskiness in his herd when they ate a certain plant with
 red berries.
  Tea is attributed in the orient to Damura,the founder of Zen. Although
 the legend is complete horse-crap and I won't bore you with it.
  But that "Unusual Friskiness" is what we're interested in as hackers, mainly
 for those all night hacking sessions.
  Members of the IIRG have different tastes in there ingestion of Caffeine,
 I've Noticed Mercenary prefers Mountain Dew or Jolt, and on extremely tough
 nights will mix up High-Octane. Anubis prefers to take his in the form of
 Excedrin tablets, while most others ingest large quantities of Coffee.
  But what is truely the quickest,cheapest and most expedient way to
 a rush out of caffeine? Lets do a little exploring.

  Substance             Dosage                   Caffeine, in Milligrams
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Vivarin               one pill                 200
  No-Doz                one pill                 100
  Brewed coffee         one cup = 5 ounces       90-125
  Cocoa                 one cup = 5 ounces       5-100 Depends upon Brand
  Instant coffee        one cup = 5 ounces       60-80
  Instant tea           one cup = 5 ounces       25-75
  Black tea             one cup = 5 ounces       28-75
  Excedrin              one pill                 65
  Soda                  12 oz                    32-60
  Anacin                one pill                 32
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   As the chart illustrates Vivarin is the most potent of the pill forms of
  caffeine,although constant ingestion of these tablets will give you a
  wicked case of heartburn if you have a sensitive stomach.
   Brewed coffee is the strongest of readily available liquids, however if
  your like me, this to can bother your stomach in large quantities.
   Teas alright, but without some chinese food to go along with it, I dont
  want it.
   Soda must be selected with care for the maximum content, Coke contains
  3.5 mgs per ounce, hence for a 12 Ounce soda it would contain 42 mgs of
  caffeine. The FDA requires that a cola contain no more than 5 milligrams per
  ounce, thus Jolt has 60 milligrams in a 12 ounce can.
   Thus for your hard earned cash, 1 package of Vivarin or a 6-pack of Jolt
  would be your best investment.

   MAKING HIGH-OCTANE

   Ingredients: 1 Package of Vivarin (16 Tablets)
                1 Cup Sugar
                1 Gallon Fruit Juice
                1 Mortar and pestle
                1 Blender

   Prepare sugar in Mortar by grinding into powder and pour into fruit juice
   Crush down and grind Vivarin into powder and pour into fruit juice
   Pour juice into blender and whip at high speed until frothy
   You now have 1 gallon of High-Octane with 3200 Milligrams of Caffeine
   Drink in small amounts over your hacking session, preferably with one or
   two other people.

  -WARNING-: Ingestion of High-Octane can be dangerous to your health
             and the recipe is provided here for informational purposes
             only. The Author and Publishers of Phantasy disclaim any
             responsibility for individuals attempting to prepare or
             ingest the recipe.

 Section [5]: RUMOR MILL
              Edited By: Mercenary

 There seems to be quite a bit of Rumors flying around in the last several
 weeks, so the IIRG has decided to review the most popular.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Following information, (EDITED) has been circulating up in the New England
 area of operations. The file has been validated as legal as the individual
 named is known to have turned in The Purgatory BBS for having semi-legal
 posted material.

 City/State    : Wallingford, Ct.
 Zip code      : 06492

 Biography:

 After being thrown out of the military service for computer hacking while
 on duty, Its believed that Ronald is now trying to court favors from AT&T
 for a $50,000 job in New Jersey by turning in phreakers and hackers.
 It is already officially confirmed that Ron has turned in one BBS and
 is now setting sites on other BBS's. Its too bad he doesn't know about
 AT&T's policy of not hiring hackers as they figure that an ex-hacker
 employee cannot be trusted,we urge you to delete him from your system
 if you have any files that are not public domain.

                         MESSAGE FROM LOUIS CYPHER
                       Date:7/31/92    Time:4:21 pm

The file areas have been closed due to some, uhhhh, 'legal' problems...I can't
really say when they will be opened again, or if the board will continue to be
up....all I can really say is that it is nothing for YOU to worry about. I just
have recieved some information that is disturbing to ME, and hence the file
areas have been closed, and the board might go down for an indefinite amount of
time....If you call, and the number has been disconnected, then you know what
happened....for those of you that see me on other boards, you can e-mail me
there and I will try to explain the situation to you, and tell you if the board
will be going up again or not....
It was fun while it lasted(already speaking in past-tense...damn)....well, I
hope to be able to continue running the board, but if things get any more hairy
then they are now, I am afraid it will be no more...

 My 7 year old son was watching TV this morning,and I
 happened to hear the words "Legion of Doom" .. I went
 to look at the TV and saw some bizarre wrestling types
 ("WWF")  in makeup , posturing themselves..

 Maybe we should warn the Secret Servce.
