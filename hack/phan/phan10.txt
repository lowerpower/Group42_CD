                **********  PUMPCON  BUSTED!!!  ***********
                                10/31/92
                    written by someone who was there
                     who wishes to remain anonymous

 NOTICE:  The word "Hacker" is used frequently throughout this file - it is
          to be interperated as "a computer literate person", and NOT as
          "someone who engages in illegal activities using a computer".

Friday, October 30, Pumpcon began, at the Courtyard of the Marriott, in
Greenburgh, NY.  All in all, about 30 hackers showed up, and had a great time.
At least until the evening of Oct. 31st, when 8-10 members of the Greenburgh
police force showed up and raided the Con.  At the time of the raid, there were
between 20 and 25 hackers in the hotel.  3 of the 4 rooms rented by Con
attendees were raided.  All the occupants of these rooms were taken to a
conference room, and then another hotel room (255) where they were held
approximately 6-8 hours for questioning.

The police all came in unmarked police cars, and parked on all 4 sides of the
hotel.  No one noticed they were there, until they were standing in the hall
where all 4 rooms were located.  The officers stood in the hall outside the
doors, but did not enter the rooms right away.  They waited about five
minutes, for some unknown reason, which was just enough time for them to be
noticed by the hackers in at least one of the rooms.  Unfortunately, there was
no way the hackers in one room could warn the other rooms - the fone lines were
busy, and the cops in the hall kinda left the "walk down and tell 'em in
person" option out.

  The police produced copies of a search warrant to search rooms 246, 233, and
237.  Room 246 was the one where everyone was hanging out; it was pretty much
THE room.  It was where the computers were located, and where most of the Con
attendees were 99% of the time.  The other two rooms were rented by attendees
of the con, and were simply used for sleeping quarters.

Before too long, the police entered the rooms, and began rounding up people.
My recollection of this time period is a bit faint, and I don't remember all
the minute details.  All I know is that we all ended up in a conference room,
and then room 255.

A few hackers who had been out driving around during the time of the bust
returned a few hours later, and when they were seen by police, they were
immediately taken to 255 and questioned.  (They were walking down the
hall, when a cop appeared, and told them to step into a room)  The cops asked
them if they were hackers, and when they didn't answer, one police officer
reached into the coat pocket of one of the people, and produced an auto
dialer.  This in itself was enough to send the three to room 255, where the
rest of the hackers were being held for questioning.  My question to you -
isn't that just a bit illegal?  Bodily search without probable cause OR a
warrant?  Ooops - I'm forgetting - we're HACKERS!  We're ALL BAD!  We're
ALWAYS breaking the law.  We don't have RIGHTS!

Room 255 was packed.  No one was allowed to smoke, and everyone was nervous
as hell.  One by one people were called to be interviewed, with some
interviews lasting 5 minutes, others lasting 30 or 45 minutes.  Some people
were sleeping, others were conversing, and still others were shaking, and
looked like they were about to puke at any second.  Even though the situation
was quite serious, a few joked around, saying things like "So guys, I guess
PumpCon '93 won't be held here, eh?".

No one knew who was going to be arrested, or when they would be released.
The 2 cops in the room with them were actually pretty cool, and answered any
questions they could to the best of their knowledge.  They weren't the guys
in charge of the investigation; they were simply there to make sure we didn't
leave.  Of course, as friendly as they seemed, they were still cops...

All the people who were detained were held until between 5:45 and 6:30am.
Four hackers were arrested, 1 because 2 of the rooms were registered in his
name, a second because he signed for the rooms, and the others for previous
crimes, apparently.  No one knows as of yet. As of this message, no news
on what will become of those arrested is known.  They have not yet been
arraigned.  The other hackers were all searched, questioned, and then released
pending further investigation.  Those under the age of 18 had their parents
notified.

To my knowledge, there were no federal investigators there at the time of the
bust.  However, people kept mentioning the FBI and the Secret Service, and it
is very possible that they will be called in to investigate.  Actually, it's
more than just possible, it's almost guaranteed.  The police said that
although most of those detained were released, there will most likely be more
arrests in the near future, as more is learned about the alleged illegal
doings.

3 computers (2 Amigas, and 1 AT&T dumb term) were confiscated, along with
anything which looked like it could have been involved in phone fraud.  For
some odd reason, although Auto Dialers were listed on the search warrant, not
all of them were confiscated.  I acutally don't know if ANY were, I do know
that not ALL were. ;)

In one of the rooms, there were about 2 dozen computer magazines which were
apparently confiscated, although the warrant did not specify that magazines
could be taken.  But, when you're busting HACKERS, I suppose you can take what
you want.  After all, hackers are evil geniuses, and don't have the same rights
as NORMAL criminals do.

As of yet, the actual charges against the hackers are not known.   The raid
apparently stemmed because the hackers were ALLEGEDLY using stolen calling card
numbers and/or access codes to obtain free phone calls.  One of these card
numbers or codes was rummored to have tripped a flag at AT&T, which alerted
security personel that something was possibly wrong.

This assumption about the calling card fraud is made because the police
confiscated any calling card found during their searches, and some of the
questions they asked the detained centered entirely around calling card
theft and use.  A few other questions asked me were "Do you know what
computer systems were accessed?", "Do you refer to each other with handles?",
"Who was primarily responsible for this meeting?", and "Where did you hear
about this meeting?"

My interview lasted only about 10 minutes, and it started at about 5:50am.
Everyone was dead tired, and the cops wanted to get everything over with
as fast as possible so they could get some sleep.  After the interviews were
over, everyone left, to wait and see what the next few days will bring.

I am releasing this file now, to prevent any rumors from starting, and to try
to make the outside world aware of what happened during PumpCon.  I have
left out any specific incidences and references to specific people as a
precaution, since the investigation is only beginning.  We were hoping to write
a file of all the attendees of PumpCon, to share with the world the names of
those who were there.  However, as you can obviously see, that would be highly
stupid.  For anyone who WAS there who is reading this, rest assured that the
running list of names which was kept made a very tasteless dinner for the one
who had it in his pocket.

Oh, BTW, one of the cops who was apparently in charge made a comment to me...
he said "You can post a message on the boards telling your friends to stay
out of Greenburgh".  Well boys, you heard him - PumpCon '93 will be held in
Greenburgh, at the Courtyard Marriott....


                            *--------------*

The following is a word for word copy of the search warrant issued to each
person who was detained and questioned.  No spelling errors were corrected,
but I probably made a few when I typed this in.  Oh well.

 Now for the truth on Caller Id Operation,

 1. A Caller Id phone or box will show the information for every call WHERE
   THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE, If the the call comes from another area,
   where Caller ID has not yet been approved, or from an area that is not
   connected to your area's service, the display will read "OUT OF AREA".


 2. If a caller pays for the block-out service and prevents information from

             DIGITAL TO CLOSE TWO MANUFACTURING FACILITIES


               DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION ANNOUNCES
           ITS INTENTION TO CLOSE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
        IN SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS AND BURLINGTON, VERMONT



 MAYNARD, Mass. -- October 29, 1992 -- Digital Equipment Corporation
 informed its employees today that it intends to close its
 manufacturing facilities in Springfield, Massachusetts and
 Burlington, Vermont. There will continue to be Sales and Services
 facilities in both cities.
     The process for the plant closings, which will affect
 approximately 320 employees in Springfield and 350 in Burlington,
 will be a gradual reduction of the workforce over the course of six
 months. It is expected that the process will be complete by April of
 1993.
     The details for closing the plants were outlined today to
 employees in group meetings. Digital will offer the affected
 employees a number of benefits including a financial support package
 based on years of service to the corporation; continuation of
 medical, dental and life insurance for a specified period; and
 professional outplacement assistance.
     Edward B. McDonough, vice president, Manufacturing and
 Logistics for Digital, said, "The computer industry has been going
 through a period in which technology has advanced by orders of
 magnitude, increasing the efficiency with which products can be
 manufactured.

     "The movement of computing power to semiconductors; the shift
 in demand to high-volume, low-margin commodity products; and the
 decreased demand caused by a soft worldwide economy has left
 Digital, and other companies in our industry, with excess worldwide
 manufacturing capacity. For over three years, the corporation has
 been restructuring its manufacturing function to adjust to the new
 capacity needs by eliminating redundancies and divesting in areas
 where we cannot clearly differentiate ourselves in the market."
     McDonough continued, "Manufacturing will remain a core
 competency for Digital. Our goal is to position manufacturing
 capacity to best serve our customers worldwide and to optimize the
 utilization of our assets. It is on the basis of this strategic
 intent -- and not an issue of quality of work -- that the decision
 was made to close the Springfield and Burlington plants. Both plants
 and their employees have held an important place in Digital's
 history."
      The disposition of the two sites, which are owned by Digital,
 has not yet been determined. The corporation is currently working
 with state and local governments, as well as outside organizations,
 to find external alternatives for the plants.

 Part 2:
                FBI EAVESDROPPING PLAN DRAWS INDUSTRY FIRE

                               By Steve Higgins

  A broad flank of computer industry and public policy groups is
 rallying in a renewed attempt to thwart an FBI proposal to limit the
 security of electronic communications.
  The U.S. Congress adjourned last month without considering a bill embodying
 the FBI's so called "Digital Telephony Proposal," which seeks to force
 vendors and end users of communications equipment to ensure the FBI's
 ability to tap their communications networks.
  "But they will probably do it next year," said David Banisar, a policy
 analyst for Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
 in Washington.
  That likelihood has generated a round of vehement opposition from an
 unlikely consortium:  industry vendors including IBM and Sun Microsystems
 Inc., professional groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the
 CPSR, and watchdog organizations including the American Civil Liberties
 Union.
  If the proposal becomes law, "it will require that every system from
 AppleTalk LANs up have multiple, redundant systems to let the FBI tap
 them," Banisar said.
  In its proposal, the FBI suggests levying daily fines on vendors and
 users of equipment that do not comply.
  "We have to have the technical capability, or we are out of the business
 of wiretapping," said Keir Boyd, deputy assistant director of the FBI's
 technical services division in Washington.  "We are not willing to back
 off on the compulsory part."
  Those opposed say the FBI's plan would cost U.S. industry money by
 requiring that vendors and users retool existing products. The opponents
 also say that the plan would hinder U.S. competitiveness by preventing
 American companies from developing advanced communications equipment
 and that it would pave the way for groups other than the FBI to tap
 private communications.
  "We are moving [to] a society where E-mail communications and video
 conferencing are the norm," said. Whitfield Diffy, a cryptography engineer
 at Sun in Mountain View, Calif.
  Diffy said that if the FBI proposal is passed, privacy will be virtually
 non-existent and "democratic government and free life could be swept
 away."
  All that, members of the opposition say, is not worth the value of the
 estimated 600 to 800 wiretaps that the FBI conducts each year.'
  Next year, the rhetoric is likely to rise as Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT)
 and Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Texas) formally consider the proposal for inclusion
 in a congressional bill .
  But, for its part, the CPSR isn't waiting until the next Congress to take
 action. The group recently filed a request under the Freedom of Information
 Act for the FBI's reasoning behind the proposal.
  Meanwhile, CPSR and other members of the consortium are still talking to
 the FBI to head off what they consider an extreme proposal.
  "We always offer to be helpful, to see if there are any less Draconian
 solutions," said John Podesta, a consultant at the Electronic Frontier
 Foundation, a lobbying group of industry professionals in Washington, who
 said meetings with the FBI are "always cooperative."
  But, Podesta added," [the FBI] still always seems to say,'We won't back
 off of this legislation.' There will be a fight next year."

 Part 3:
                    PUMP-CON BUST RUMORS FLY

  Actually, here is what I heard about Pumpcon:

  They had multiple terminals set up hacking cards and systems.  The manager
 came to the door and told Randy that there was a noise complaint.
  Just as Randy was starting to talk to the manager, the Feds, AT&T security
 and various other organizations busted into the room.
  They Rounded up 35 people, some of which are still in jail because they
 couldn't make bail.  The case is a now federal one, having been turned over
 to the FBI.
  I've also heard that AT&T and the FBI want to turn this case into an example.
 It is already high profile in the NY/CT area from what I understand, and
 those out on bail have already received messages from reporters.
  It would seem to me that the noise complaint was just bullshit to get them
 to open up the door.
  Now the question that comes to mind is how did the FBI, AT&T security and
 everyone else coordinate so quickly and bust this hotel room?
  Well, speculation is (as always) that someone dropped a very big dime on
 Pumpcon.
  There is also speculation on who did it.  Right now the leader in
 the polls is No Name Brand.
  NNB has friends in Metromedia and AT&T security.
 Keep in mind that he was busted not too long ago and returned to hacking in
 record time.
  His excuse for not showing up?
 According to him, his ride (Orion) screwed him over and left him.
  Another possibility kicked around was that Phiber did it to receive a break
 on his upcomming sentencing but most people aren't going for this one.
 Most are going the NNB route.
  Randy's phone is tapped.
  Night Ranger reportedly got away (he and Spicoli supposedly carded their
 room and $110 worth of pizza).
 All this info is second generation from Randy S. Hacker.  Believe what you
 want, make your own conclusions.
  Thirty five people...they didn't have enough cells for them all and
 supposedly questioned them for 10 hours.  In my opinion, someone dropped a
 dime on them.  It is also my opinion that NNB was that person.
  He is just the type of self-serving, vindictive, egotistical little fuck
 to pull a stunt like that.

 Part 4:
                      RESPONSE TO PUMP-CON RUMORS

                     THESE RUMORS ARE NOT TRUE!!!!

  Yes, there were computers there.  NO! they WERE NOT set up to hack cards and
 systems!
  People were playing games on them, and a few people were calling out at
 various times.  The FBI was **NOT** there.  AT&T security WAS there though.
  The case has NOT been turned over to the feds - it's still a local thing,
 and will hopefully stay that way.  Only 4 people were arrested, 3 of whom are
 out on bail, 1 had an outstanding warrant and was being shipped back to his
 home state.  He had no bail set.  I talked to Randy myself, just got off the
 phone with him.
  He set me straight on a LOT of things.  There are a LOT of places where the
 cops possibly screwed up, which may help the defense.  No one knows as of yet.
  The charges are apparently are "Illegal use of a computer"  and "Computer
 trespass".  There may be more charges added at a later time, and there may be
 charges dropped.  It's too early to tell.  AT&T said there was an 800 system
 in GA which was hacked "by SOMEONE in that room" and that apparently set off
 flags all over.  *I* personally know of NO such thing, OR system,and neither
 did a few others I talked to.  I DO know for sure that whatever was done, it
 wasn't Randy's fault; I didn't once see him behind a terminal.  I believe to
 that it was a setup - PumpCon was HIGHLY announced, and there were a few who
 could have benefitted from "ratting" on it.
  I don't know who those people are, nor will I point any fingers.
 But I guarantee you the person, if any, who set up PumpCon will wish someday
 that he hadn't.  Anyway, I wanted to post this to clear up the rumors that
 are starting.  I know I can't control them all, but some of this shitis
 getting WAY out of hand.

 Biography:

 After being thrown out of the military service for computer hacking while
 on duty, Its believed that Ronald is now trying to court favors from AT&T
 for a $50,000 job in New Jersey by turning in phreakers and hackers.
 It is already officially confirmed that Ron has turned in one BBS and
 is now setting sites on other BBS's. Its too bad he doesn't know about
 AT&T's policy of not hiring hackers as they figure that an ex-hacker
 employee cannot be trusted,we urge you to delete him from your system
 if you have any files that are not public domain.

Subject: File 4--Computer Access Arrests In NY (NEWSBYTES reprint ((CR))

 GREENBURGH, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 NOV 3 (NB) -- The Greenburgh, New
 York Police Department has announced the arrest of three individuals,
 Randy P. Sigman, 40; Ronald G. Pinz, Jr, 21; and Byron J. Woodard, 18
 for the alleged crimes of Unauthorized Use Of A computer and Attempted
 Computer Trespass, both misdemeanors. Also arrested was Jason A.
 Britain, 22  in satisfaction of a State of Arizona Fugitive From
 Justice warrant.

 The arrests took place in the midst of an "OctoberCon" or "PumpCon"
 party billed as a "hacker get-together" at the Marriott Courtyard
 Hotel in Greenburgh. . The arrests were made at approximately 4:00 AM
 on Sunday morning, November 1st. The three defendants arrested for
 computer crimes were granted $1,000 bail and will be arraigned on
 Friday, November 6th.

 Newsbytes sources said that the get together, which had attracted up
 to sixty people, had dwindled to approximately twenty-five when, at
 10:00 Saturday night, the police, in response to noise complaints
 arrived and allegedly found computers in use accessing systems over
 telephone lines.  The police held the twenty-five for questioning and
 called in Westchester County Assistant District Attorney Kenneth
 Citarella, a prosecutor versed in computer crime, for assistance.
 During the questioning period, the information on Britain as a
 fugitive from Arizona was obtained and at 4:00 the three alleged
 criminal trespassers and Britain were charged.

 Both Lt. DeCarlo of the Greenburgh police and Citarella told Newsbytes
 that the investigation is continuing and that no further information
 is available at this time.

  Now we find that Ronald Pinz has been arrested at Pump-Con, what better way
 than to court favors from AT&T than to attend a hackers conference, let
 people incriminate themselves and than have the police barge in an arrest
 you and the others. Ive heard AT&T security was there, Now doesnt that make
 you folks out there wonder? Lets see what happens to Mr. Pinz in court.

  Bad news from Berlin, on Wed. Oct 25th,twelve mailboxes,25 machines,and
 some thousand floppies were seized. People are charged for distributing
 pirated software. The local DA refuses to give further information.
  But the real thing is, some sysops couldnt resist to keep track of TOO
 MUCH INFORMATION, not only names,telephone numbers,and addresses, but even
 precise logs of who downloaded which software.
  Authorties are believed to be planning on prosecuting users who downloaded

 Section [6]: PHANTASY TIDBITS: News and Views of Interest

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Part 1: Police Officials Cited for Searching Private Computer Records

  Los Angeles (AP, 30 Oct 1992) More than 45 police officials have been
 cited since 1989 for using department computers to check the backgrounds
 of baby sitters,house sitters, and others for personal reasons.
  "Its a very serious problem", Police Commissioner Ann Reiss Lane Said
  The citations came to light after a civilian Police Commission investigator
 was suspended 10 days for using department computers without permission to
 get confidential data on White Supremacist Tom Metzger and actor Arnold
 Schwarzenegger.
  The union representing Robert Bauman appealed the suspension and submitted
 records showing that more than 45 department employees had been disciplined
 in the last three years for illegal computer use.
  Most recieved suspensions of two or three days or verbal reprimands.
 As an example, Lane said Thursday, an officer might use the computer to check
 the background of an individual about to marry one of the officers relatives.
  Bauman's 1--day suspension without pay was upheld last week by the Civil
 Service Commission. Bauman, a 23-year civilian employee, said he already
 has served the suspension and was back at work. Bauman a permit processor
 routinely uses police computers to check the criminal records,police files,
 and tax records of people apply for police permits for massage parlors, gun
 stores and pawn shops.
  He said he gathered information on Metzger because he is a part-time
 historian who does research on right-and left-wing political groups.
  Bauman said he tapped into Schwarzeneggers files because a co-worker
 was curious about the actor.

 Part 3: Landmark Software Decision

  Published in the San Francisco Examiner is the following legal decision on
                             disassembly of software

    "In the first binding ruling on the application of copyright law
     to a common process called reverse engineering, a federal appeals
     court said video game maker Accolade Inc. of San Jose could copy a
     video game system's code copyrighted by Redwood City-based Sega
     Enterprises Ltd. in order to design games for the Sega console.
     Reverse engineering is the parctice of taking apart a product to
     see how it works, and using the knowledge to design one's own
     product.  During the process, Accolade made a copy of Sega's
     encoded computer program, designed to exclude unlicensed game
     makers, in order to translate the information and extract the key
     to the code.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal in San Francisco
     said the copying did not violate Sega's federally protected
     copyright on it's software package.  The court said Sega's
     exclusive rights over it's own programs did not entitle it to
     Enterprises Ltd. in order to design games for the Sega console.
