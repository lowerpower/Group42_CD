              By: Mercenary


 Well Folks, I've got good news and I've got bad news.....

 First the bad news, The Rune Stones public line will not be installed most
 likely until May of 1993. This is due to the fact that I'm moving again.
 For those IIRG Members with access to the private line, please note that
 that the number will be changing. Please pick up the newest member package.
 My move is prompted by the current economy, hence where the money is, so am I.
 So whem Im settled in at my new location, so will the Rune Stone.

 Now the good news...

 The Rune Stone BBS number will be made generally available to all readers of
 Phantasy and when you log-on and become a Validated user,you will have
 access to over 3000 H/P/A Text Files.

 Please note that due to my changing locations, the next several Issues of
 Phantasy may be slow in appearing as I'll be busy and wont have much time
 to devote to the magazine till after the move.

                               Thanks for the Help and Support

                       OPERATION GRAY CHIP COMPLETED

  The FBI,US Customs Service,and Internal Revenue Service along with
 detectives from Santa Clara,San Jose,and Fremont California have just
 completed a four month sting operation code-named "Operation Gray Chip".
  Undercover agents and detectives reportedly bought and sold allegedly
 stolen semiconductors and computer parts on the "Gray" Market.
  The sting operation targeted brokers and dealers in California,Taiwan,
 Argentina, and Singapore. Most of these dealers have reportedly been
 selling parts to legitimate computer companies in the United States and
 Far East for years. Some 30 "Gray" Market brokers have been arrested
 as a result of the sting operation.
  The sting operation is said to have been designed to send a message to
 those who purchase semiconductors,disk drives, and other parts from less
 than legitimate sources According to Sgt. Paul Kirby of the Santa Clara
 Police Department.
  Those individuals arrested have been charged with criminal conspiracy,
 and multiple counts of attempted receipt of stolen property. Names of
 those arrested and the companies involved are expected to be released
 soon.
  Parts for the sting were provided by Intel,Quantam Corp,and Conner
 Peripherals,along with other well known companies. The sting involved
 sales by undercover agents to brokers who thought they were getting a
 deal because the merchandise was HOT.
  More than 2 Million in Cash and 1.55 Million in parts were confiscated
 over the 4 month duration of the operation.

Hello, this is John or Predat0r the former SysOp for Blitzkrieg BBS. I'd like
to say as of the 12th of January, 5.00pm, 502-499-8933 will no longer be an
active line which means the system's gone.

When I get a new line and a new number I'll put it on Pentavia, Ripco, other
real popular boards like that. I'd like to say thanks for everybody who
supported the system while it was up.

>From February of 1990 to January 1993 it had 27,834 callers. The last official
user to call was Sinister Solution.

I'd like to say when the new system goes back up it'll be bigger, better and
even more underground than it was now.

I officially retire as Predat0r and I officially retire Blitzkrieg. So when the
 new system goes up, I'll have a new handle and a new name for the board.

If you need to get in touch with me, use the post office box, there still good
and if you want my new voice number you'll figure out how to get it.

Stay free and I'll see you all again real soon...

        AT&T SMART CARD VOICE PRINTS INCREASE SECURITY OF NCR ATMs

     SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- NCR Corporation and AT&T Smart Cards
have demonstrated a prototype of a new generation of automated
teller machines (ATMs) they are developing that will use AT&T's
contactless smart card technology to offer customers additional
services, like a security system that works by verifying the
cardholder's voice print.
     The prototype and several potential applications of the new
terminals are being shown at the Retail Delivery Systems Con-
ference here this week.
     The two AT&T units also announced that AT&T's smart card
readers can be connected to NCR's point of sale terminals, and
that they will begin working with banks to develop new smart
card-based applications that will run on ATM and point of sale
machines.
     NCR, a unit of AT&T, is the world's largest supplier of
ATMs.  AT&T Smart Cards is a leading supplier of contactless
smart cards and applications.
     AT&T contactless smart cards look like other bank cards--
they're the same size and just as thin--but they have
microprocessors and memory chips laminated within their plastic
shells.
     Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the United States,
their electronic memory can hold the equivalent of several pages
of typewritten information, personalized to the card's user.
     That data is accessed by a reader/writer device, which, in
addition to being installed in an ATM, can be connected to a cel-
lular or wired telephone, personal computer, automobile (for
electronic toll collection), or other device.  Because the reader
has no moving parts, it is more reliable than contact-card
readers.
     "Our smart card can be viewed as a secure, portable, per-
sonal database that will provide banking customers with enhanced
security and a broad spectrum of new services," said Diane
Wetherington, president of AT&T Smart Cards.
     {familiar ATM into a new kind of financial transaction
station," said Jim Adamson, vice president of NCR Self-Service
and Financial Systems Division in Dundee, Scotland.
     "One obvious benef{ion beyond PINs (per-
sonal identification numbers), which a thief might be able to
find out.  For example, one of the demonstrations at the Retail
Delivery Systems Conference will be a voice-based security system
that works by comparing the cardholder's voice print with one
stored on the card.  Unless the two match, access to the account
is denied.
     "But that's just the beginning," Adamson adds.  "Since much
of a customer's account information is stored on the card, he or
she doesn't necessarily need to go to an ATM if all they need to
do is check that information.  You can use a personal computer
with a smart-card interface, for example, or a similarly equipped
public telephone.
     "Of course, security features on the card will prevent users
from changing the information on the card when they are not
linked to their bank's computer network."
     When customers do go to an ATM, they are given customized
menu options based on their account profile stored on their smart
cards.  This might even include offering them a connection to a
financial institution not normally on the ATM network, such as
a brokerage house where they have a money market account.
     In addition to convenience and security, another benefit of
using AT&T contactless smart cards with NCR's terminals, is that
a single card can be used for multiple applications--a solution
to consumer complaints about the proliferation of cards they need
to carry around.
     Using AT&T's communications network and NCR's installed base
as a backbone, AT&T can develop and deploy applications for a
variety of customers.  For example, a single card could serve as
an ATM card, an insurance information card, and a debit card for
making purchases in a store, placing phone calls, paying highway,
bridge and tunnel tolls, paying mass transit fares, and even
buying from vending machines.
     Funds for each of these uses can be transferred at any ATM
from the customer's bank account to the debit portion of the
card.  With a smart card reader/writer connected to an NCR point
of sale terminal, the consumer has access to a full range of pay-
ment options.
     AT&T smart cards also make it possible for ATMs to expand
beyond mere banking functions.  For example, "electronic tickets"
for airline travel, sporting events, plays, or concerts could be
purchased at an ATM and loaded onto the smart card.  The card
would then be accessed at the airport, stadium, theater or con-
cert hall.
     "The AT&T contactless smart card reader is a perfect example
of the potential for joint technology development between NCR and
AT&T," said Adamson.
     AT&T plans to make the smart card interface available to
other terminal developers, as well.
     NCR, an AT&T company, develops, manufactures, markets,
supports and services enterprise-wide information systems for
worldwide markets.
     AT&T Smart Cards, based in Bridgewater, New Jersey, is an
AT&T strategic business unit that develops and markets smart card
products and applications.
     The business does all of its development and manufacturing
in the United States (its factory is located in Little Rock, Ar-
kansas).  AT&T also has a cooperative agreement with Nippondenso
Co. to market smart card applications in Japan.

ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND ABOUT AT&T'S SMART CARDS

     AT&T's smart card consists of an 8-bit microcomputer, and
features its own operating system, 3 kilobytes of electrically
erasable read-only memory (EEPROM), an asynchronous serial data
link, and a security system to prevent files from unauthorized
use.
     AT&T's smart card differs from other smart cards in several
important ways:
   o It uses a contactless interface to provide power to the card
     and to perform data transfer.  Other smart cards have ex-
     posed metallic contacts, which produce reliability problems
     with wear, contamination, and damage due to electrostatic
     discharge.  AT&T pioneered a design that allows the smart
     card to transmit data to a card reader without metal-to-
     metal contact.  The card transfers data by changing the
     charge on capacitive plates in the card and the reader.
   o The microprocessor uses a flexible, UNIX(TM)-like operating
     system designed specifically for AT&T's smart card.  Host
     computers or terminals can interact with the card using
     predefined, high-level software commands.
   o Security is also enhanced by the inclusion of a security al-
     gorithm.  Encryption, decryption and message authentication
     can be performed to facilitate secure transmissions over in-
     secure links to and from the host system or terminal.
   o The card's file management architecture allows a number of
     applications to reside on one card.  For example, in
     banking, one card can be used to hold information on a
     customer's checking, savings, loan, and line-of-credit ac-
     counts, while also storing biometrics, such as the
     customer's signature, voice and fingerprints for security.
     In addition, that same card can be used for travel or other
     applications.
   o The card has built-in security features.  Information stored
     on the card can be isolated in such a way that access to
     data in a particular file on the card can be limited to
     users authorized to access that portion of the card.  This
     allows different applications to reside on the same card
     without giving all handlers access to the entire database.
     AT&T smart cards are already being used in several ways:

ELECTRONIC TOLL COLLECTION
     Without stopping, drivers approaching a toll plaza insert a
smart card into a transmitter mounted on their dashboards.  In-
formation stored on the card is transmitted to the toll station
via radio link, and the cost of each toll is either debited from
a pre-paid amount on the card or recorded for billing later.

PENSION RECORD-KEEPING
     Italy's post office is now using a pension-administration
system supplied by Olivetti that uses AT&T's smart card as a
record-keeping device for pensioners.

COMPUTER SECURITY
     Other customers are using the AT&T smart card to limit ac-
cess to computer systems containing proprietary information.
Authorized users dial into the systems from their portable com-
puters, and the systems have been programmed to interface with
a smart card.  Without the card, the systems cannot be accessed.

BUILDING SECURITY
     AT&T has several applications in the U.S. and Japan in which
the smart card is used for employee identification and building
access control.
     But these are just the beginning.  The government could use
smart cards to replace printed food stamps, driver's licenses and
voter registrations.  And a medical smart card could provide a
physician with a patient's complete and up- to-date medical
record.  The same smart card can also store insurance information
in a separate file.  Having this information on a card would also
expedite admittance to a hospital.
     "The 1990s is a decade of customization," says Wetherington.
"Businesses will need to redesign the way information is gathered
and processed, in part because customers' definitions of ac-
ceptable service times and intervals are changing.
     In some cases, this will require reengineering where and how
products and services are delivered.  "Smart cards will
revolutionize personal and business information access and
processing by providing instant point-of-need transactions," she
said.

                      DEA SECURITY - NOT THAT SECURE!

  The Government Accounting Office (GAO) has just released a new report
 titled "Computer Security: DEA is Not Adequatly Protecting Sensitive
 Drug Enforcement Data".
  It seems DEA Agents reguraly made standard Security Violations in the
 areas of,

    1. Sharing Computer Passwords
    2. Left Passwords Taped to Terminals
    3. Used easily identifiable Passwords (Such as "DEA")
    4. Threw out Classified Materials in the Trash

  So for all you Console Cowboys hacking the DEA, times a Wastin
  these boys know nothing of proper security procedures!

 numbers, Sysops' handles, Sysops' real names, Sysops' voice
 numbers, Sysops' addresses, Sysops' ages, his accounts on
 small-time pirate boards, EVERYTHING! This kid fucked
 EVERYBODY over! Several decent pirate Sysops deleted their
 entire hard drives for fear that the FEDS would come knocking
 at their doors. He shattered the fragile trust that exists
 between the members of Connecticut's pirate community. In a
 taped phone conversation (which was eventually made into a
 Sound blaster VOC and then distributed) he admitted to
 turning in pirate boards and also uploading viruses to
 several BBS's. He also said that his "master plan" consisted
 of bringing down all pirate boards and trashing the local
 modem scene with "outside help from ex-modemers" who
 supposedly hold grudges against current-day users. He turned
 in kids who were hacking Internet also. If this kid ever
 calls your BBS, just fucking delete his punk ass!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We didn't know if the information was true as Mercenary is based in CT. and
 He'd heard nothing of any Major BBS Busts or actions in the area.
  But all of a Sudden this appeared in the Paper as well as in CUD 5.03.

  From the 1-7-93 Issue of The Cheshire Herald (Front Page)

          THREE CHS STUDENTS CHARGED IN BURGLARIES
           Former CHS Student Also Charged in Case
               by Amy Carpenter, Herald Staff

     Three Cheshire High School students and a former student charged
with the theft of $23,000 worth of computer and electronic equipment
from the high school have turned themselves in to Cheshire police.

     Jared D Bishop, 17, of 500 South Meriden Road, William J Vallo,
17, of 1081 South Meriden Road, and John Beltrami, 17, of 12 Woodland
Drive, have each been charged with 6 counts of third-degree burglary,
6 counts of third-degree conspiracy to
commit burglary and first-degree larceny by common scheme,
police said.

     Brendan Monahan, 17, of Littleton, New Hampshire, was
charged with third-degree burglary, third-degree conspiracy
to commit burglary and third-degree larceny, police said.

-Lesser Charges

     Monahan, a former CHS student, received the lesser charges
because he is believed to have participated in only 1 of 6 burglaries
at the high school, said Detective Thomas Stretton.

     Bishop and Vallo turned themselves in last week, and Beltrami and
Monahan turned themselves in early this week, Stretton said.

     All four were released to the custody of their parents
and are scheduled to appear in Meriden Superior Court on
January 14, police said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 It seems funny to us that these two incidents would originate from the same
 place, so there may be some validity to the Rumor we recieved.

                      IBM WORKING ON SUPER DRIVE?

  IBM Corporation is rumored to be working on a read/write head for hard-disk
 drives that will propel disk bit densities up into the range of 8 billion bits
 per square inch. Current leading edge Winchesters area densities are in the
 neighborhood of 250 million bits per square inch.
  Even this may fall short of the rumored that students at the University of
 San Diego are working on a head capable of 10 Billion bits per square inch.

                        THE GRIM REAPER IS A NARC
                Oh No!, Mr. Narc has kicked me out of TDT!

=============================================================================

  Today at about 6:00 Central time I was talking with my girlfriend.
 I clicked on my call waiting button and it was The Grim Reaper
 (Mike A.(IIRG DELETE). He told me to call him back because his didn't want
 to pay for the phone call. I told him I would call him back in 5 minutes and
 he said fine. I was called back 10 minutes later by Grim and he told me I was
 kicked out.I asked why and he said it was because I hadn't called him
 back. He said I didn't respect him and wasn't loyal to him. He went on and
 on about how I've never done anything for TDT, but now that
 he has kicked me out,I guess I might as well tell everyone the real story
 about The Grim Reaper.
        The truth is Grim is a narc.  He is the one who got Mind Bomb nailed.
 He went off on Sought After and has been trying to get him busted for
 a while.  His next targets are Renegade Chemist and Butcher.  He always
 told me that all other cracking groups would eventually die out.  And the
 way this would happen would be through his great ability to narc.  Why do
 you all think I followed him from FLT to OFG to TDT?  Remember Infinite Range
 Rock?  He wasn't loyal to Grim, he was nailed.  I've stuck with that fucking
 Narc for 3 groups.  He has told me a lot of shit, and now I'm going to tell
 it all to you.
        I have nothing against TDT, I have nothing against Sought After, or
 anyone in the pirate scene.  I do have something against Grim.  He was the
 person who took the fun out of all the groups I was in.  He wanted people
 to fear him.  And when I wouldn't kiss his ass he kicked me out.
        Grim didn't even go to court when he got busted with TNSHB.  I don't
 know all the details about the deals he cut, but I know he is a narc.
 He is putting out shit about me not doing anything for the group which is
 complete bullshit.  People like the Grim Reaper should not be in the pirate
 scene.  He kills accounts, he busts people, and ruins BBSing to further
 himself.
        Luckily, I have a life!  People like the Grim Reaper who quit
 college, have no job, and no friends to BBS are sorry.  I'm going to lay
 low for a while, and just hang out on a few boards.  I'm done with groups.
 TDT is and will be my last one.  I have a girlfriend, I have school, and
 now I don't have to deal with Grim's bullshit.  My warning to guys in TDT
 and the pirate scene.  Grim is a NARC, you don't screw with people like
 that.  I've learned my lesson.  All I can say is get out of TDT.  Get out
 from under the thumb of Grim.  He will fuck you over.

 Grim Repear [TDT/NARC] DD Go ahead bust me.  I can care less. Hell, you can
   even post my address and come to my house.  The last time we talked I had
   it .VOC'ed.  I kept tabs on you Mike.  I'm not going to release it unless
   you try something.  Like I said before, I'm not here to take TDT down or
   do any bullshit like that.  I'm here to tell the truth.  Don't fuck with
   me Mike.  The only way to learn from a narc, liar, and thief like you is
   the hard way.  I've learned, and now it's over.  Go to hell, die, and
   get a life fat ass.

 Sought After [TDT] DD  I have nothing against you.  You are cool Zach.
   Everything I thought about you was wrong.  I was brainwashed by the big
   Narc.  Get out while you can.  You know he busted Mind Bomb, you were
   on the fucking phone, don't deny it.



 To All DD  I never tried to break apart TDT after I found out I was kicked
            out.  I'm not interested in going after Grim or narcing on him,
            unless he pulls his bullshit on me.
