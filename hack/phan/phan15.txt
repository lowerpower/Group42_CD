 Section [2]: Not Dead Yet
                                         From: DR. RIPCO

  Were not dead yet, but getting there...

  Well folks, things didn't quite work out as we planned, no surprise with
 messing with Unix based OS. Because of a limitation in the OS and the
 hardware on this end, the expected closing is going to be delayed for a while.

  We'll probably be playing with the new system on a different machine so
 things here will be normal, or as close to it for a while.

  Things are a bit screwed up though, since everything was transfered off and
 returned back in a different order a few minor items got messed up. I'll be
 tweaking things on and off so hang on to your shorts if you run into a
 problem.

                                               Dr. Ripco

                                       RIPCO II BBS (312)-528-5020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Date: Sun  4-11-93, 10:26 pm
   From: DR. RIPCO
     To: All
Subject: System Closing Update

 Just to clear up the situation around here and to answer the bunch
 o'questions I've received in e-mail...
 First off, the system will be gone sooner or later. Some things jumped the
 gun without proper forethought but since somewhat new ground is being broken
 around here, the earlier annoucement probably should not have been made when
 it was.
 Secondly the new system at this point in time will be a complete second
 system totally disconnected from this one. It'll be that way until the
 second system is stablized enough to run on it's own.
 I've even been toying with the idea of letting this system run on it's own,
 probably on a different phone number even after the second system gets
 going. Not sure on this matter, it depends much on how the newer system
 looks to me and what it's capable of doing.
 In any case, to answer the question of when and if it's worthwhile calling
 here for the mean time, the answer is soon, probably by mid-summer at the
 earliest and no later than fall. If things don't come together by then, I
 doubt if it'll come to pass at all.
 To answer the question of "why" is simple. The new system presented itself
 much easier in thought than in real execution. Everything is going along but
 each step taken creates another fork in the road. Rather than killing the
 current system off and making the users pay for it in frustration of it
 being here one day and not the next, it was decided to start from scratch
 and all the "messing around" will be done on another computer system.
 So consider things to be "as usual" for the immediate future.

                                               Dr. Ripco

 Section [3]: Phone Phreak Techniques
              By: Mercenary

  As companies attempt to secure there phone systems, many phreakers are once
 again turning to residential systems to secure there on-line time.
  I feel this may be the kiss-of-death for many of you out there.
 For everytime phreakers abuse residential systems a general uproar is usually
 started in certain Law-Enforcement circles after numerous complaints from
 residential customers.
  I present to you here some more of the popular scams being used by the
 phreaking community at this time.

 1. THIRD PARTY BILLING

  This scam usually is pulled on someone the phreaker knows, but dislikes.
 It works well with traveling salesmen or others who's job requires them to
 spend a large amount of time away from home but leaves their family behind.
  The Phreaker will pose as the individual who is away and will have the
 operator call the real individuals home.
  The operator will inform the family Member that their "Loved-one" is making
 a third-party call and will they accept the charge.
  The unsuspecting family member will say, Yes we'll accept the charges
 thinking it is their real "Loved-one"
  And thus the phreaker has secured his access.

 2. JUST SAY YES!

  With this scam the phreaker will pose as a Security Representative of an
 individuals long distance carrier (Sprint,AT&T,MCI) and say someone is using
 your phone line for some form of illegal activity.
  He will inform the unsuspecting "mark" that if he will accept a request to
 charge a long-distance call to his phone from the operator who will call him
 in several moments, it will allow them to trace the "criminal".
  The phreaker will of course explain to his "mark" that he will credit their
 account and they will not really be billed for the call.
  Being a law abiding "Americas Most Wanted" viewer, the mark will of course
 help the "Security Representative" get his man and accept the charges.
  Once again the phreaker has secured his access.

 3. CALL FORWARDING SCAMS

  A phreaker posing as a telephone company technician will go to a "marks"
 house and present a legitimate looking ID they will have either scanned
 (stolen from a real employee) or created with a desktop publisher.
  He will inform the "mark" that they are having problems with the lines in
 his area and could he come in and do a quick check on the "marks" line.
  The phreaker will go to the "marks" phone and do what looks like just a
 quick check of the "marks" phone, but in reality he is call-forwarding the
 phone to a payphone where his accomplice will answer the phone.
  He will inform the "mark" that everything is fine and will leave.
  In the meantime, his accomplice will be answering the payphone and saying
 yes, I'll accept the charges for half of their phreaking buddies around
 the country placing third-party-calls.
  Sometimes the phreakers will not even enter your home to call forward your
 phone. they will clip into your lines with a homemade linemans handset and
 call forward from there. This is known as "Call Clipping".
  This particular technique works well in apartment complexes  where almost
 all the junction boxes are located in the basement.

 4. SOCIAL ENGINEERING

  In this scam, the Phreaker will call his "mark" posing as a police detective
 or some form of Law-enforcement official. The Phreaker will inform the "mark"
 that they have caught a family member or close friend commiting telephone
 fraud.
  The Phreaker will say that he cannot give out the name of the individual,
 because if he's innocent, the police do not want to make his name public.
  The phreaker will then ask the "mark" if they would help clear their family
 member or friend by accepting a collect call so they could trace the call to
 the real "criminal".
  Once again the phreaker gets his time.

 Section [4]: DEF CON I Announcement

 Hey Schlenises:

 Pulled from the fringeware@wixer.cactus.org

                   Finalized Announcement: 4/09/1993

              We are proud to announce the 1st annual Def Con.

  If you are at all familiar with any of the previous Con's, then you
 will have a good idea of what DEF CON I will be like. If you don't have any
 experience with Con's, they are an event on the order of a pilgrimage to
 Mecca for the underground. They are a mind-blowing orgy of information
 exchange, viewpoints, speeches, education, enlightenment... And most of all
 sheer, unchecked PARTYING. It is an event that you must experience at least
 once in your lifetime.
  The partying aside, it is a wonderful opportunity to met some of the
 celebrities of the underground computer scene. And those that shape its
 destiny - the lawyers, libertarians, and most of all the other There will
 be plenty of open-ended discussion on security, telephones and other
 topics. As well as what TIME magazine calls the "Cyberpunk Movement".
  Las Vegas, is as you might have guessed a great choice for the Con.
 Gambling, loads of hotels and facilities, cheap air fare and room rates.
 It's also in the West Coast making it more available to a different crowd
 than the former Cons have been.
  Your foray into the scene and your life will be forever incomplete
 if by some chance you miss out on DEF CON I. Plan to be there!

   WHO:  You know who you are.
  WHAT:  Super Blowout Party Fest, with Speakers and Activities.

 DESCRIPTION:
  So your bored, and have never gone to a convention?  You want to meet
 all the other members of the so called 'computer underground'?  You've been

 writers, activists, lawyers, philosophers, politicians, security officials,
 cyberpunks and all network sysops and users to attend.

 Vegas at the Sands Hotel.  Why Las Vegas?  Well the West Coast hasn't had
 a  good Convention that I can remember, and Las Vegas is the place to do
 it.
  Cheap food, alcohol, lots of entertainment and, like us, it never sleeps.
 We will have a convention room open 24 hours so everyone can meet and plan
 and scheme till they pass out.  Events and speakers will be there to
 provide distraction and some actual information and experiences from this
 loosely knit community.

 the time, dates and location of the convention.  Future announcements will
 inform you about specific speakers and events.

Andy Hawks has been producing an electronic mailing list called Future
Culture for the last two years, catering to the desires of modern
thinkers. This list, along with the Frequently Asked Questions file which
is a primer for the list,arose out of an interest primarily in cyberpunk
fiction, particularly the idea that "cyberpunk is really about the present".
>From there, the spectrum of information contained in the FutureCulture
list spread to include a wide snapshot of aspects of modern culture
that are ahead of the mainstream, oriented towards the near-future.
This includes all realms of what is commonly called "new edge",
"technoculture", or "cyberculture" -- a mishmash of postmodernism,
psychedelics, hacking, raves, cyberspace, industrial music, cyberpunk
fiction and realities, etc., that are proving to be important
constructs in the evolution of world culture.

The list and file continues to grow and morph, gaining a wide audience
including,at one time or another, a variety of sociologists and
anthropoligists, authors and writers, hackers, scientists, students,
and prominent "cyber-" oriented figures.Those who share an interest
in the topics discussed in the file can participate in in-depth or
light-hearted discussions via the FutureCulture E-list.

Concurrently, and independantly, Paul Leonard has been releasing fiction
into the cybersphere through the Cult of The Dead Cow. The goals of cDc
, since it's inception in 1986, have always been to create a culture within
the new world of cyberspace. He has also ventured into the realm of print
publishing with FNORD! Magazine, from 1989 to present.

The two of us came together through the FutureCulture mailing list, along
with the Leri & Aleph mailing lists. The bond was solidified over
discussions on the Internet Relay Chat #leri conference. After a long period
of deliberation it was decided that we should allow our ideas to propagate
to as many people as possible. We decided that the best way to do this
at this time was to start a print magazine based around our ideals. We
live in a world where paper and television are the informational
messengers of choice to the masses.

The magazine will be designed and produced on the Macintosh computer, in
an 8 1/2 x 11" format, and each issue will be in the area of 64 pages. We
are planning to sell the magazine at a cover price of $3.50 (US), but
until costs are measured, we cannot say for sure.

We are looking for submissions and assistance with this project from all
angles:  fiction writers, essayists, ranters, graphic designers,
artists, poets, etc.  Submissions are welcome in any form, in any
style, in any tone, though that is not a guarantee that everything we
receive will be printed.  We are looking for submisisons as soon as
possible, but feel free to send them in whenever you like.  For first
issue, send them in by the second week of April.

Due to lack of available resources, we are unable, for now, to reward
monetarily those who contribute to PHAGE. We have have little money, and
our primary interest is producing the highest-quality magazine possible,
containg an immense spectrum of information.

 Section [6]: The Rumor Mill (Unconfirmed Rumors From the Underground)
              Edited By: Mercenary and Anubis

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

              *** HARD CORE IS A THIEF AND HERE IS PROOF ***

All right before I start on the actual proof here I want to make shure that the
few well known facts are stated so that EVERYONEknows the real story!

 1) Ultima 7 Part 2 was released by Public Enemy first it was uploaded
    to Unlawfull Entry about 4-5 Hours before TDT's version was
    released!

 2) As I was starting to upload the third disk a TDT courier was
    downloading Public Enemy's Crack file.

 3) 4-5 hours later Hard Core nukes Public Enemys version saying the
    original and the crack were stolen from TDT. (Hard Core in particular)

 4) Hard Core's proof of the stolen crack consisted of blank lines that were in
    our TSR file that were supposed to have originally had Hard Core's first
    name in there twice ROB ROB.


 Now these are known facts and im shure no one will dispute the fact that
this was the information that was being spread by TDT namely Hard Core.
Well I am here now to prove the thief to be Hard Core. First we will adress the
ROB ROB that was supposed to be in Hard Core'sTSR. If you look to Rob's TSR you
will find that the ROB ROB that is in there also has many other blank spaces
around it. You may ask yourself why are those other spaces there??
Well i'll tell you, the TSR that was used was written by TERMINATOR he took it
from a previous crack of his that he did while he was cracking for Fairlight a
little while back. That release was called MEGAFORTRESS. If you download that
release from any BBS you will find the TSR to be the same one with TERMINATOR'S
info filling those blank spaces perfectly! I will upload the TSR from that game
following this text file get it and compare orif you want to be 100% shure
download MEGAFORTRESS pull it apart and see for your self! Now if this is not
enough for you people who still dont believe I have a second piece of proof for
you! Download any TDT release that Hard Core supposedly wrote a TSR for and run
it. You ask what for?? because you will hear silence! Now do the samewith any
game TERMINATOR cracked and wrote a TSR for and run it. You will hear
Terminators LEGENDARY beep. Now the deciding factor run the TSR from TDT's
version of Ultima 7 and holy shit it fucking BEEPS! Now for a third piece of
information any of Hard Core's TSR's that you will look at stay in memory where
Terminators ALWAYS TERMINATE! The TSR that we supposedly stole from Hard Core
Terminates from memory! See what happened here is whoever stole TERMINATORS
crack for Ultima never took out his beep and put ROB ROB in there to try and
make it look like we stole it from Hard Core. Now I dont know if hard Core did
this or Hydro did this (since Hydro uploaded the crack file I dont know why)
but whatever the case Hard Core claimed this to be his own! So its very obvious
that Hard Core was NEVER able to crack this game!
To Hard Core if you really could not crack the game why not deal with it?
Did you really think you were going to get away with this?
I really cant believe this was done...
But at least the truth is nowout all that is left to say is

                             GREAT JOB TERMINATOR!

                       1993 - 3RD YEAR ANIVERSARY ON IBM

 For all of you guys that wonder what the HELL is going on in the PIRATE scene
 right now...

  [1] Public Enemy is the first group on the IBM that took another groups
      crack and game and released on their own, they are NEVER gonna get
      respect on the scene since they fucked up so badly, they will always be
      remembered as a NO BALLS GROUP.

  [2] The Grim Reaper is NO LONGER affiliated with TDT since he tried to run
      the group on his own and start to tell people this and that person was
      out of TDT
      I'm the only person in this group that can do that.

  [3] There is no changes in TDT except of one person i out of it. If you
      have any questions about this contact me on Unlawful Entry.

  PERSONAL NOTES:

  THE HAWK - How can you be so lame and calling me a lie'er when you know
             in your heart that you guys stole my crack and remove my name?

  SPEED MASTER - Don't try to put an attitude on anyone, a lowlife like
                 will never kick ass like you always wanted, you should just
                 crawl back to your whole and keep shut up

  BLADE RUNNER - Man, get a life. Your mates at PE dont even know how to spell

  SCRIPT LANGUAGE - Dont tell me you loose respect for me for doing this,
                    you are the one loosing respect from everybody

  RESET OF PE  - How can you guys stay in such a lame as group, where you guys
                 dont have the balls even to admit you guys cant crack shit

  THE SCENE    - Don't ever respect anyone in PE LAME. You can rag, you can
                 bullshit, call each other lamers, but NEVER EVER steal
                 somebody elses CRACK that that person spent 4 days to do,
                 and then try to tell him he is a fuckhead. There were several
                 persons that got the game and even HAL9000 said he dont even
                 try on this one. NOBODY belives a slow fuck like terminator
                 could do it, and besides, he just needed to change my crack a
                 bit.

  FINAL WORD   - A few positions left in TDT, if you are the one that
                 want to be a part of a REAL CRACKING GROUP then contact
                 us today!

                 FIGHT AGAINST LAMERS!!!

                    IIRG NOTE ON SECT NEWS ANNOUNCEMENT

       The previous news file released by SeCT is partially correct.
  The IIRG has recieved a tape of a phone conversation that was apparently
 secretly recorded amongst some of the people mentioned in the SeCT file.
  The truth of the matter in what we've transcribed so far is that the only
 real person responsible was the person named "JASON".
  Mercenary recieved an E-mail letter from one of the persons mentioned in
 the file and this is what he recieved... (Edited of Course)

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

 Subject:      SIN CITY BBS
 To: The IIRG <works!mercenar@uunet.UU.NET>

 Hello... this is Lou XXXXXXX... I have written to you in the past... I have
 seen an article floating around recently accusing me of having helped out in
 the turning in of XXX XXXXS... this is not true. it has come to my attention
 that Muther has given you the JASON TAPES as I call them... I think you know
 what I'm talking about... please help me clear my name... I was an active user
 and contributed much to XXX XXXX before its demise... why would I want it
 down? I had no motive whatsoever! Jason is fully responsible... not me, and
 not Kevin XXXXX. Please transcribe the JASON TAPES in the next issue of
 Phantasy so that justice may be done. Thank you, I appreciate this. please
 reply

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  The IIRG will be presenting a transcription of the Tape in Phantasy 17
 and hopefully this will correct some of the dis-information floating
 around out there and clear the matter up once and for all.

 Section [7]: PHANTASY TIDBITS: News and Views of Interest

                          PUPILS HAD BOMB GUIDE
                          ---------------------

                  150 - Page Manual Came from Computer

  Lebanon,CT. - A 150-page manual on how to make bombs and homemade explosives
 has been found in the hands of 13-year-olds in a Connecticut middle school.
  The inch-thick book, chock full of tips on bomb building and vandalizing
 schools was discovered last week at the Lebanon Middle School after a
 Mathematics teacher overheard a discussion among a few of his pupils.
 "It explained how to make bombs and how to cause mayhem at the school." said
 resident State Trooper Mark Maynard, who was called in to investigate.
  The manual had been obtained through a non-school computer bulletin board by
 an older brother of one of the middle school pupils.
 "The boy who obtained it is a computer whiz. He said he obtained it for the
 purpose of doing a class project," Maynard Said.
  But four or five copies of the manual wound up in the hands of middle school
 pupils and were being sold to seventh- and eighth-graders for $10.00 apiece.
  The older brother, a high-school student, apparently retrieved the computer
 information about two months ago, but it did not surface at the middle school
 until march 14th, not long after the bombing at the World Trade Center in New
 York City.
 "The first concern was that it was related to that," Maynard said. "It just
 happened to surface right after it".
  And while retrieving such information falls under Freedom of Speech and is
 not illegal, it is against school rules to sell anything not for a school
 Fund-raiser, said Bert Bosse, principal of the middle school.
  Superintendent of Schools Albert Vertefeuille said some disciplinary actions
 will be taken against the pupils for selling the computer document on school
 grounds, but he declined to elaborate on what that action would be.
  The computer information was not obtained through any school computers, but a
 copy was later placed on one of the computers at nearby Lyman Memorial High
 School. That also violated school rules, the school officials said.
 "The thing that bothered us was that there was specific things on how to
 terrorize schools,teachers,and principals," said Bosse. "My biggest concern
 was not that any of the kids we dealt with would have used this for terrorism,
 but they may have tried to attempt [to build explosives] themselves and caused
 serious injuries."
  Nationwide, hundreds of children and teenagers are maimed or killed every
 year from experimentation with homemade explosives. Information obtained from
 computer bulletin boards on homemade bomb making has been a major contributor
 to such mishaps, police said.
 "I think the problem is there is no law pertaining to this," Maynard Said.
  In connecticut, teenagers learning how to manufacture bombs through home and
 school computers contributed a nearly 50 percent increase in the number of
 homemade explosives discovered last year by state police.
 "We are definitely seeing more of it. Kids by nature experiment", said Sgt.
 Kenneth Startz, who supervises the emergency services ddivision of the state
 police, which includes the bomb squad.
 "Bosse described the boys involved with the incident at the middle school as
 good pupils who had not been in trouble before. He said he believed they were
 driven by curiosity than anything else.
 All of the kids were very cooperative, Bosse said. The parents were totally
 shocked when they read what was in it".

                   HIGHWAY SIGN HAS OFFICIALS BLUSHING

  Fairfield,CT.-Thousands of motorists traveling South-bound on Interstate-95
 got a terse message on an electronic traffic sign: "YOU ALL SUCK".
 We dont know how they did it," said State Police Lieut. Albert Masek of
 troop G in Westport. "We thought maybe a computer hacker did it"
  The incident was reported on the morning shift Sunday, Apr. 4th and
 responding troopers could not disable the large, yellow lights on the
 portable, 10-foot-high sign located near Exit 19. The sign displayed the
 message for several hours until a state Department of Transportation crew
 got it covered with a large tarp.
  DOT spokesman William Keish said Monday that the sign can only be programmed
 from DOT offices in Wethersfield or State Police headquarters in Meriden.
 Bill Stoeckerd, director of DOT's incident management office reprogrammed it
 Monday.
  "Were taking steps with the contractor to upgrade our security," said
 Stoeckerd. "We really don't know, whether [the pranksters] were able to come
 into access accidentally or not."
  He said the sign, in use since August, was recently the target of a similar
 prank, but not the exact same wording.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         VULGAR HIGHWAY MESSAGES AN OUTSIDE JOB, POLICE SAY

  Connecticut State Police have concluded a computer infiltrator is
 responsible for two crude messages, the latest lambasting Gov. Lowell P.
 Weicker Jr., that have flashed on a highway electronic message board in
 Fairfield,Ct. in the past two weeks.
  CT State Police Master Sgt. Scott O'Mara would not comment on reports that
 police had identified a suspect, he said "the 10 day old investigation was
 progressing".
  The message board reportedly can only be operated from the state Department
 of Transportation operations center in Wethersfield or the state police
 communications center in Meiden,CT. but police believe the vulgar messages
 did not come from either of those locations.
  Instaed, "We believe it's a computer crime by modem through a phone line",
 O'Mara Said.
