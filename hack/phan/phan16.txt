 Section [1]: Local Lamer Update
              By: Mercenary

  As promised in Phantasy Issue 16, here is a partial transcription of a tape
 supplied to the IIRG by an anonymous donor thru an IIRG member.
  Now I've reviewed the entire tape, and this is the only area of it that I
 find relevant to the story or truly interesting.
  The mentality of the person recorded on this tape, (Player #3) leaves
 something to be  desired.
 Now (Player #1) has sent me e-mail which I provided to you in Phantasy 16.
 By the contents of this tape he seems to be innocent, and I would hold blame
 against (Player #3) in this sordid little tale of jealousy and back-stabbing.
  The hacking world should be based upon the ideal of free information and the
 free exchange of ideas for all.
  If any sysop has this user on their system and you can identify Him, I
 would urge you to delete his account as this individual does not deserve
 any form of access and could not be trusted in the hacking community.
  The IIRG takes care to protect everyones Identity, so we've only used the
 culprits first name. I know this may seem like more than he deserves, but
 alas how can one preach ethics If he doesn't practice them.
  If the individual who was responsible for this incident reads this, I would
 urge you to reconsider your values, take some time to grow up, and most
 importantly of all - Sell Your Computer - We don't need your kind in
 cyberspace.
  I know our judgement may seem harsh to some, but we'll let you decide
 for yourselves after reading this little play constructed for your
 enjoyment by the human values of jealousy,envy, and mental unstability.

  PS: Many thanks to the individuals who sent this our way, it caused
      much merriment and hysterics at several IIRG meetings.

 3: I didn't Fuckin do that

 1: The only thing...

 3: How the fuck would I know everbodys handle on the pirate....

 1: The only thing that I....

 2: Alot of people don't know who...

 1: Jason,Jason I will swear to God right now, the only thing that I posted
    that was accusatory to you was what you had Ok'd on the phone that didnt...

 3: What do you mean that I'd Ok'd...

 1: Listen the thing that I'd typed up...

 2: You had said it was Ok

 1: Listen, the thing that I'd typed up that night when we were on the phone
    and when you were talking about it, that thing, after I read the whole
    thing to you you said oh-hoh, you didn't say you didn't want it posted,
    You didn't give any negative feelings towards it whatsoever.
    So I posted it, it had nothing to do with trying to get you in trouble,
    it was merely, it was like a newspaper article, it had, it wasn't look
    "Oh everbody go kill Jason because he did this."

 3: The next day fuckin Stargazer called me up with Eddie, thinking....

 1: Well now the whole things blown out of proportion. Because what started out
    as an informing article has become..

 2: Something else. something that has nothing to do with Lou, Lou's now
    fucked entirely.

 1: Well the thing is here, since um..., Rob and AJ were on the phone at the
    time that you were talking about this along with me. They have a,...
    They've talked to sysops and they've gotten sysops to listen and they're as
    you know they're very credible in the modem world and they got sysops to
    listen. And sysops now believe, for the most part anyway.
    But the, the damage isn't completely undone.
    But most sysops now believe, based on what AJ and Rob tell them, and from
    their accounts of listening, that I am innocent in every respect to this
    and that I had nothing to do with it other than taking it down and posting
    it.

 2: You didn't do anything...

 1. I only posted..

 2: Other than talking to them on the phone and that was stupid

 1: Right

 1: I only posted what you had said was Ok, the night that I had wrote it.

 3: I never said that was Ok,I thought it was funny,but I never said it was Ok.

 1: Well if you thought that, you should have said, well thats great Lou, don't
    upload it anywhere or don't post it...You Know??
    But I mean...

 2: You have a mouth, you use it alot. If you really objected you would have
    said something. Your a Bullshitter.

 1: And if you were afraid of being caught, then you would have told me..
    "Oh, No-No, Don't,Don't Don't..." You Know??
    So that just...

 2: Hey smartmouth, you always hear what you think. If that was true, you would
    have said something.

 1: Exactly, now listen, I'm doing the best, I'm doing the best to get my name
    cleared up. In this case I think the best thing to do is just tell, if
    you wanna get un-blacklisted if you think you are, or if you just want to
    get back in the good graces of local sysops. The best thing to do is just
    tell them exactly what you told me, exactly what you said to the S.P.A.
    Sure...

 2: Tell them you did it as a joke, maybe that will help.

 3: Thats because I didn't give them anybodys name.

 1: Well...

 2: I thought you gave them like everybodys.

 1: Well, Listen if you post that, if you post that, then ah.., then things
    will be Ok. I mean I know. I'm gonna tell you right now, thats not the
    whole truth.

 2: Yeah, because Jason, you have'nt said anything lately.

 1: Because I heard, I.....

 3: Well thats because, I have'nt been able to get on the fuckin boards, every
    local board. Deathstar hasn't answered for me, its been busy the last half
    hour. I've been lettin it ring.

 1: I,I,I, will stake my ah.., I will,I will,I will risk my life right now, I
    will swear on my life that you,that you gave Vinnies board number to the
    SPA, Because I heard you do it. I was on the phone when you did it and you
    can't deny it, because you did do it.
    Now if you post that to sysops because that is the truth, if you post that.
    First of all the SPA never got back to you did they??

 3: NO

 1: So if you post that to sysops, look I gave the the number but the SPA
    never called me back anyways, so it doesn't matter. Because if they were
    going to take any action they would have called me back.
    They probably thought it was a little prank. From what I understand, some
    users heard about it and then they called up the SPA and said that you were
    their little brother playing a joke. Ok so that....

 3: Which users??

 1. That probably prompted the SPA to say, "Oh this is bullshit, will just
    ignore it and throw the number out. That is what probably happened, because
    thats what I heard some kids did.
    Now....

 3: Like who??

 1: They Saved your ass by doing that, because if they hadn't done that.
    The SPA wold have taken your call "Seriously" and would have taken some
    action and we would all be screwed.

 2: Especially you.

 1: Now listen...

 3: Why me??

 1: Because your the one that did it. Now listen....

 3: SO

 1: If you post...

 3: I didn't do it...

 1: Oh My God!! Just don't deny it Jason

 2: Jason

 1: If you, If you deny it, then things will just get completely worse.

 2: Jason, I think you can say it to us, we know...
    Jason, I was on the phone....

 3: Im glad, I hope it gets worse.

 2: Jason, I was on the phone, AJ was on the phone,Lou was on the phone.
    You can say it in front of us. Were not gonna go "OOOooo Guess what
     happened". Like I dont give a shit.

 1: We all thought of it as a joke.

 2: The only thing Im worried about is my Board stays up.

 3: Now I don't

 Section [2]: SIN CITY BBS: Valgamon's Story
              Written and typed by Valgamon on May 9, 1993

     Now I have tried to clear my mind before I wrote this...
 to ward off all outside influences. Because I want the public
 to know the TRUTH about the demise of the Sin City BBS, so
 they can do away with all the HYPE and DIS-INFORMATION.
     The basic story is, I was a user on this BBS. I had an
 agreement with the SysOp (The Plague) that I would supply him
 with "0-day 'zines," (electronic magazines given to the
 Plague on the same day that they were published) in exchange
 for unlimited download access. Now, granted, some of you out
 there are scratching your heads and wondering, "How could the
 Plague be so dumb? That deal's not fair!" Well here's why...
     The Phantom, SysOp of the Legion of Doom BBS (also in
 Waterbury), was also after my 'zines. He wanted to get them
 before the Plague. (Apparently the two boards were in heated
 competition). But Phantom made no offers to me... he just
 wanted them and that was it. So obviously I turned to the
 Plague to see what his setup would be. He offered me the
 aforementioned plan. But a crucial factor of this plan (which
 I adhered to even up to the HOUR of Sin's expiration) was
 that I make my 'zine supply EXCLUSIVE to The Plague. This
 prospect infuriated the Phantom, who immediately lowered my
 access on his BBS. But I didn't care, I had no ratios on Sin!
     Things went well for a few weeks. Under the handle
 "Dolph Lundgren,"  (yes the guy from Universal Soldier and
 Masters of the Universe and Rocky 4, etc), I kept a steady
 stream of 0-day 'zines coming in to the City, and I flexed my
 downloading muscles as well. But I NEVER leeched beyond what
 I felt was a reasonable amount, based on what I sent up. I
 did what I would have wanted the Plague to do for me if the
 situation was the other way around (do unto others, bla bla).
     So things are going great. I get the files I want and he
 gets the 'zines he wants. NO PROBLEM. If left uninterrupted,
 this setup would have probably continued to this day.
 Unfortunately, this was not the case.
     JASON L*****, a high school junior from Wallingford,
 takes a major role in this case starting now. You all
 probably shudder at the mention of his name, and
 subconsciously start hiding boxes of floppies and preparing
 to nuke your hard drives. I am not surprised.  Even before
 this whole incident, Jason had a track record of turning in
 boards (Thunderstorm/Vampire Connection 2, Firezone, Brigade,
 etc) and the sysops of those boards will confirm this. Before
 he ever came into the picture, Jason was ALREADY a HATED SPA
 informant. Audio tapes of tapped phone conversations (in
 which he boasted about busting boards and uploading viruses)
 were made into Soundblaster .VOC files and played on speakers
 across the state. In fact I personally called up some Sysop
 friends of mine and made sure that they heard these tapes.
 There was no doubt as to whether or not it was Jason doing
 the talking; they had all spoken to him before (some had even
 been prank-called and threatened by him). So let's just
 establish that Jason's credibility was already PROVEN to be
 LOW, if not NONEXISTENT, before this whole thing started.
 Now, what he did in relation to Sin...
  Jason and I were acquainted before this incident. I
 hesitate to say that we were friends, but we did talk
 occasionally. I had very little respect for this bastard of
 an SPA informant, who worked in conjunction with them to
 further his own personal goals and desires. (Something which
 even the SPA condemns). He did it for the MONEY, not out of
 some great desire to help software publishers. He was NOT a
 do-gooder, he merely wanted to get CASH REWARDS, cause
 anarchy and chaos and ruin peoples' lives. Jason THRIVED on
 HATE and MISERY, a fact which several of my Sysop and user
 friends will confirm. He loved to see people squirm. But he
 was very crude and barbaric about making them do so. For
 instance, he would call up people at 2 in the morning and
 have his soundblaster shout swears at them. He got even more
 joy out of doing this if the people were senior citizens! He
 preyed on the weak for sheer enjoyment. He even mentioned to
 me one time that when his basketball team was losing, he felt
 a "deep inner warmth" because his teammates felt bad. THIS IS
 JUST A SAMPLE TO SHOW YOU WHAT KIND OF A PERSON JASON IS. He
 is the kind of kid who kicks you when you're down, whether
 you're friend or foe. And incidentally, and OBVIOUSLY,
 friends are one thing Jason L. had no great surplus of.
     Now, in one of our few conversations, Jason mentioned
 to me how he was surprised that I was getting all these great
 new files. Frankly, he was amazed, and a little bit jealous.
 He wanted them too, but didn't have the access to get them.
 So he asked where I got them. I refused to tell and changed
 the subject. But Jason didn't stop there. He PAID a user
 (who I won't mention here to protect his identity) ten
 dollars to get one of the files that I got from Sin and had
 uploaded somewhere else. He then looked at the info file
 contained within that archive and found the Sin City ad. But
 the phone number was [wisely] written over with X's. So that
 put a stop to Jason's greed... or so I thought.
  Soon after, a new version of the Connecticut BBS list
 (at the time written by Kevin B***** who I'm sure you've all
 heard of thanks to the SeCT news file) was released. Now,
 just a quick side-note on Kevin... the SeCT file (which I'll
 explain more about later) incriminates him as having been the
 MASTERMIND behind the busting of Sin City. THIS IS NOT TRUE.
 SeCT is mistaken. Kevin merely included Sin's number on his
 BBS list. He had NO CLUE what kind of a BBS it was, he didn't
 even call it. He had just received word (from who I don't
 know) that Sin existed, and since it WAS a BBS and it WAS in
 Connecticut, why not put it on the CT BBS list? THAT IS ALL
 KEVIN IS GUILTY OF, spreading information innocently
 with no malicious intent.
     Anyway, this version of the list came out with Sin's
 number on it, and of course, (you're way ahead of me) Jason
 got a copy of it. Now Sin is LD to Jason, but he didn't
 care. He immediately dialed it up and applied for access,
 with FALSE personal information. He portrayed himself as a
 blue-collar worker in his thirties who had recently been laid
 off from Pratt & Whitney. He claimed to have a lot of
 references which were completely BOGUS. He CONNED the Plague,
 or at least made an attempt to. Well the Plague must have
 seen right through Jason (who gave a fake phone # too)...
 because he put him in the GENERAL NEW USER VOTING section,
 which was essentially a death sentence for NEW USER LAMERS.
 Their personal information would be seen by already-validated
 users, and when it was found out that they had NO legit
 references and not much to offer, they'd be voted down and
 eventually DELETED. That is what SHOULD have happened to
 Jason's fake account. But it never got the chance. Here's
 why... Upon discovering that he was being voted down (new
 users being voted on can call and check their status), he
 went into a fit of rage. Everything he'd worked for was going
 down the tubes. His jealously of me and his sheer hatred and
 desire overwhelmed him. Once again, HE CALLED THE SPA.
  Now this may or may not be true, because Jason had been
 known to use this as a scare tactic on sysops who won't grant
 him access. He even TOLD me that he did it. But that is
 irrelevant. Because as soon as the Plague found out (through
 a tip off by ME), he immediately jumped the gun and took
 action. Now I even told him that Jason MAY BE lying about
 calling them, but he didn't care. He started deleting all his
 stuff systematically. He nuked his tape backups, his 1.7+
 gigs, EVERYTHING. His justification for doing this (which I
 found to be completely reasonable PROVIDED there was proof
 that Jason actually called) was that he had a hell of a lot
 to lose if he DID wind up getting busted. A family, a career,
 a house, kids, and possibly facing stiff fines and jailtime.
 He didn't want that, and I wouldn't have either if I were in
 his position. But amid all the chaos of the situation, the
 Plague's rationality and logical behavior escaped him. He
 literally went nuts for a time. And in this bewildered state
 of paranoia, he went looking for people to blame. And he
 found ME. He claimed that since I knew about Jason having
 called, that I was an accomplice and had helped the vile
 informant. Now as you know I found out from Jason TELLING me
 by his own free will, and I was so disgusted that after he
 told me I just hung up and ripped the cord out of the wall. I
 had a bad taste in my mouth. I mean, how could anybody be
 such a JERK and not have a guilty conscience?! But anyway,
 back to the story... the Plague turned against me, even
 though throughout this whole thing I had been trying to help
 him. He threatened to make my life miserable for months to
 come. (Which he has partially succeeded in doing if it gives
 him any comfort). He threatened me with violence, harassment,
 and more. He had, in his state of shock, convinced himself
 that I was plotting against him with Jason. I even offered
 to give him Jason's phone number and address, to see if that
 would calm him down and get him to think straight... but he
 didn't want to hear it. As far as he was concerned it was
 written in stone. I WAS GUILTY. And this is what he professed
 to all his friends and associates (which led to the creation
 of the SeCT SPA news file which you'll hear about VERY
 shortly if you haven't already). So essentially, Sin City was
 dead, and I was to blame as well as the truly guilty one.
  Well now I was ticked. I no longer could get the files I
 wanted, and on top of that, I had been framed! Now all I
 needed was some icing on the cake of death. That came in the
 form of a text file that I got from Misty Mountain...

     SECT-SPA.ZIP -- DESCRIPTION: News about SPA action in CT
                                  Local users incriminated!

 As soon as I saw that I freaked. I didn't think the plague
 would actually go out and TELL people that it was ME! It was
 basically a file that painted Kevin Brook as having been
 behind the whole thing, with me and Jason helping as his
 lackeys. It also encouraged Sysops to delete the three of us
 from their BBS's. It was awful... and what's even worse,
 there was nothing to contest it. It was my word against
 theirs. And I had NO evidence... (or did I)?
  Now as far as the creation of the file goes, I have
 heard 2 stories. 1) There really IS a group out there called
 SeCT who goes around broadcasting warnings of FED BUSTS to
 all those involved (and to those who aren't) and 2) the user
 ALABASTER and a friend of his FABRICATED the file (which I
 wouldn't doubt because Alabaster already held a grudge
 against me and the file only showed up on ONE BBS, the one he
 had sent it to). Now whichever story is true, it doesn't
 matter. If story 1 is true, then I congratulate SeCT for
 being the lookout for FED activity. Just get your stories
 straight in the future. And if story 2 is true, then I feel
 sorry for that balding fortysomething Alabastard, if he has
 that much free time to take his revenge out on a 15-year-old
 kid then he is really PATHETIC.
  Let's review the situation. Here's what Joe Sysop knows:

 1) Sin city has been BUSTED by the FEDS.
 2) Valgamon helped the guy who did it.
 3) Joe Sysop has been advised to delete Valgamon on his BBS
    NOW HOW DO I GO ABOUT CHANGING THAT?! 1 and 2 are NOT
    TRUE... as far as I know (i read the papers and watch the
    news) NO BULLETIN BOARDS IN WATERBURY (or in any other CT
    city for that matter) HAVE EVEN BEEN INVESTIGATED, LET ALONE
    BUSTED! No action was taken! Which means that Jason never
    made that call, and I was right. And I know that 2 is false,
    but how can i prove it? Like I said before, I have no
    evidence to support my story! Ahhh... but I do!!


 Remember those TAPES I mentioned earlier? The ones on which Jason BRAGGED
about busting boards and infecting sysops with viruses? Well I had THOSE.. plus
a few NEW ones I had made (particularly of Jason lying to me that he made the
call to the SPA). So upon remembering that I was in possession of those I
immediately called up the plague. BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR IT! He was
oblivious to the truth.

What NOW?!
     One of the 'zines I had been giving the Plague was PHANTASY Magazine,
published by the IIRG in Bristol. I decided I would use PHANTASY as a medium
for proving my innocence, since it seemed to have a very large reader base
(and since CuD probably wouldn't care). So I gave the tapes to a very good
friend of mine who has connections with the IIRG. Well they got ahold of the
tapes and listened to them. MY SALVATION CAME when (Volume 4 Issue 16)
of Phantasy was released on April 15... IT STATED THAT JASON  WAS THE
ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEMISE OF SIN CITY... and that the IIRG
was going to TRANSCRIBE the tapes in the next issue! I was overjoyed!
But would people believe it? Of course! The IIRG is no small-time group..
they have been around since '82 and are VERY credible people. Their leaders,
Anubis (Sysop of Dark Shadows) and Mercenary (Sysop of The RuneStone) have LOTS
of friends in the modem world and are VERY respected. So I had been saved!
My name had finally been cleared!
 I am going to pause at this point to personally thank Anubis,Mercenary and the
IIRG for helping me out in my time of need. Without you and PHANTASY I would
still be guilty in the eyes of the modem world. Thank you for proving me
innocent.
 So this file draws to a close... I am eagerly anticipating the release of
PHANTASY issue 17. I can't wait to read the transcriptions... they will serve
as further evidence that I had nothing to do with Sin City supposedly getting
turned in. I hope the plague will see that I am not guilty and that Jason
probably never even made the call. Not that that makes him any less guilty,
I mean, he still caused the Plague to delete over 6 years of work!
 I learned an important lesson from this whole thing. The golden rule doesn't
always apply. I tried to be friends with Jason L., I tried to be nice to him...
and look what happened! I tried to help the Plague, I let him know that he
should take precautionary measures (NOT delete all his stuff) and look what he
did to me! He blabbed to everyone and their Mother that VALGAMON IS GUILTY,
HE BUSTED MY BBS! So just keep in mind that "Do unto others as you would have
them do unto you" doesn't always hold true. I know we'd all like it to, but you
really can't trust anyone other than yourself in this day and age. It sickens
me that at 15 years old I should be discovering this but I guess that's just a
lesson to me about the way the world works. Society is really screwed up.
 I apologize for the unprofessional style of this file. But I hope you all got
its message. I also made it a point not to swear. I thought that would make it
a bit easier to read this. And I want EVERYONE to read this, to hear the TRUTH!
SO SPREAD THIS FILE AROUND, UNCHANGED, TO EVERY BBS THAT YOU CALL! IT NEEDS TO
BE READ!
 If you need to contact me, I can be reached on most New Haven and Waterbury
area bulletin boards. My Internet email address is YUNSANJ@YALEVM.YCC.YALE.EDU.
 My Prodigy email address if RFTN56C. I am not going to bother with "greets,"
I feel that they would spoil the informative nature of this file. But I do want
To reiterate my utmost thanks and gratitude to the IIRG.. I am deeply in their
debt.
  So this is the end. If you have any questions, contact me via one of the
above-mail addresses that you call. Thank you for taking the time to read this,
and good-bye.

 Section [3]: Reply to Comments
              By: The IIRG

  Since re-opening our public node to the Rune Stone BBS, we've recieved quite
 a few inquiries as to the nature of our groups purpose and direction.
  The IIRG has basically been operating since around 1982, when Mercenary and
 several others started the guild on the Commodore 64.
  Mercenary is the only remaining Original member from the Commodore 64 guild.
 All of the other current members were merged into the Guild when the guild
 converted to the IBM platform during the mid 80's.
  The guilds basic purpose is to provide what we consider the true concept
 of hacking to be. The distribution of free information.
  In a world full of cash-and-carry groups that charge for file distribution
 or just to use thier name on your system, we think of ourselves as the
 renegade of groups.
  The IIRG does however screen out systems now. We never used to, but
 conditions in the hacking community forced us to screen systems.
  One of the reasons we've been forced to do this is individuals were
 claiming affiliation with us or with Mercenary (SEE RUMOR MILL) and we
 had no affiliation with them what-so-ever.
  Our basic plan for the 90's and beyond is to increase our size, further
 our file distribution network, and bring more individuals around to the
 original concept of hacking, FREE INFORMATION FOR ALL!!!!

 Section [4] : John C. Dvorak Hype
               By: Saint Anarchy

  I think the "Hype" about the Rusty-N-Edies's BBS bust is finally starting to
 fizzle out. But lets look at a few things I find interesting in this whole
 little farce.
  In the May 11,1993 issue of PC Magazine we see some comments from a name
 in the computing world we should all recognize, John C. Dvorak.
 In his article John claims that "one intelligence-gathering service has found
 over 2,000 BBS's specializing in pirated software, out of the 25,000 it
 monitors".
  Well I'm no mathematician, but to monitor 25,000 BBS's it would require you
 to call 68.5 BBS's a day for one year.
  Assuming that you applied for access on the first call, this would mean to
 call 25,000 BBS's it would require you to call 137 BBS's per day for one
 year.
  I don't know about the rest of you out there, but this seems a little
 far-fetched to me.
  Have you ever tried logging onto a real quality pirate BBS??, some systems
 I have had to speed-dial for hours before I finally get a connect.
  I also find it amusing that Mr. Dvorak didn't site his source for this
 information in his article! Why not inform the public of this terribly gross
 infringement of Sysop's rights.

 What secret agency monitors BBS's in some dark secluded Washington office??

 What Secret conspiracy is some sysop dreaming of when trading the latest
 copy of "Ultima 3 Million" to his users??

  In my opinion, only an author who's looking for magazine sales
 would make a statement like that. And lo and behold look who made it.
  Only the mindless stooges who read PC Magazine would buy a line of total
 disinformation like that.
  I think a more extremely entertaining article could be done, if John could
 actually substantiate his claims, I know I'd buy a copy if they could prove
 it beyond the hype that it is!
  And say for a minute, it was true. Whats the EFF Doing about it? Whats the
 CPSR doing about it?, I've read all their press releases and have spotted
 nothing. Could such a gross infraction of a sysops rights actually be
 going on.  I personally don't think so.

                    Opposing View Points Welcome.....

 Section [5]: How to Waste a Perfectly Good Friday Nite!!
              (Or attending the Danbury,Ct. 2600 Meeting)
              By : Mercenary and Anubis

  On May Seventh, Anubis and myself headed down to the Danbury mall to check
 out the advertised meeting in 2600 Magazine. We were not expecting a large
 crowd but we had visions of at least say 8-15 people possibly attending.
  We'd prepared for the evening by getting the malls rent-a-cops frequency
 and programming it into my scanner. On an earlier trip to the we noticed
 that the payphones listed in 2600 were directly across from the malls
 security office and we didn't want any situation like what happened at the
 Pentagon Mall 2600 meeting.
  After picking up Anubis, we headed out on the highway for the 45 minute
 trek. We were already running slightly late because I had to work late,
 and Anubis was dragging his feet like usual.
  Now the ride was going well and we had some speed metal jamming on the
 car stereo when all of a sudden around 1 curve the traffic came to a complete
 stand still, Now I don't mind driving, but I absolutely hate waiting in lines.
  So after wasting another 1/2 hour for the rubber-neckers to see some guy
 over heated on the side of the road we finally arrived at the mall.
  Now after checking the scanner on the way in and doing a quick visual scan
 of the area, we approached the meeting site.
  There was one person on the payphones, but somehow I didn't envision a 65
 year old chain smoking gray-haired female hacker.
  After waiting about 10 minutes I noticed 2 individuals approaching the
 payphones, one was carrying a copy of 2600 magazine. Great we thought
 here comes start of the crowd.
  But after approaching them and identifying ourselves we learned that these
 2 individuals were just attending for the first time also.
  Needless to say we were the only individuals to show up at the mall
 and the trip was a complete waste of time.
  To the individuals who originally may have organized the Danbury meetings
 we would ask why you didn't contact 2600 to inform them that you were no
 longer having meetings.
  And to 2600 magazine, why dont you confirm the meetings you list??
 We even contacted your 700 Number to confirm the meeting.
  PLEASE STOP LISTING DANBURY, or Contact the Individual responsible for
 the meetings and ask him whats up..
  Fed up and Disgusted....

 Section [6] FOR THE PEOPLE
             Supplied By: Those Wacky Secret Service Agents
             Edited by: Mercenary
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We've decided to change the format of For the People to bring you news from
 your favorite buddies, and mine, The United States Secret Service.
  Since the "Established Media" likes to keep the men in shades out of the
 spotlight as much as possible, we'd like to turn ours on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  THE WE CAN'T KEEP A SECRET SERVICE

  Well it seems the ole' boys in shades are ticking off the Prez and his First
 Lady. It seems that some of the Secret Service Agents are revealing some
 personal Information that the Clinton's would like left personal.
  As a matter of fact, it seems that an Official of the Treasury Department
 has delivered an ultimatum: if the SS Agents can't keep their mouths shut
 another Agency will be found to protect the Presidential Entourage.
  Just what we need, more SS Agents to harass innocent Sysop's and
 their Computing Users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    WHO's THE WIERDOS IN SHADES??

  It seems that some Secret Service Agents are complaining about service they
 recieved in a Rural Southern "Denny"s" Restaraunt.
  Particular the Black agents are claiming discrimination because the White
 agents recieved faster and more polite service.
  However, regular Black patrons of the Denny's in question say the have
 always been treated well and with very good service.
  Underground Rumor has it that a Computer Hacker was on the floor that day
 and recognized the Boy's in Shades for who they were and gave all the
 Agents very shitty service. Our hats off to the employee if its true and
 our hats off to Denny's to providing the Boy's in Shades with what they
 deserve. Remember Boy's, What goes around comes around.
  And What was that Green Shit in your eggs????

 Section [7]: The Rumor Mill (Unconfirmed Rumors From the Underground)
              Edited By: Mercenary
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Message From The Phantom :

 The Following person has tried to use Mercenary/and the IIRG as a reference
 in attempts to logon to respected private systems, in this case I will
 describe the incident that happened on my system.

  A user going by the alias of "NEW MANNING" , claiming to be from a group
 called "MASSDES" told me that "Me" sent him to the bbs for access and
 wanted to know if I wished to be a MASSDES site.  I nonchalantly asked him
 exactly what MASSDES was and he said it is a group of people that hack out
 warez from Company Unix/Vax systems and release them.  Strangely I have never
 seen a release by them and since I have even seen 95% of the one time release
 groups, I know this guy was a lamer.  I asked him what he could do about
 Strike Commander,(this was on April-2nd, and hence it was not released yet)
 and he said he has had it for a week and that it was already released by 'a
 noname group that did a home-cracking job'.  I let well enough be alone and I
 asked him if he had anything interesting and he told me 'I am working on Dark
 Sun II'.  This was quite amusing since Dark Sun I (from SSI of course) is
 being beta tested as we speak and plans for a sequel have not been implemented
 yet.
 After asking him who "Me" was, he responded Mercenary' of the IIRG.
 I asked him if Mercenary would vouch for him and he said sure.
 I asked Mercenary myself and his response was to delete this person since he
 has never heard of him.
  I asked the guy where he was from and he said 'I can not say since
 I am using a box', fine, but he said he was from area code (415) I believe
 near Springfield, MA .  (415) 234-8899 was the supplied number he gave
 my PC Board so when I was bored I tried it for my interests and apparently
 a secretary answered and said 'Law Offices', I promptly went <CLICK>.
 This was probably just a bogus number, but just in case.

 Other aliases he says that he may be recognized as: KAOS

 I asked him what other (203) systems or anywhere in New England he
 called and he said he could not reveal bbs names even.  How odd...

 This was a lamer report on NEW MANNING.

                      FREE BIRD CRASHES TO THE GROUND

 This is a very long and sad story .

  As Im writing this online .. Ill try to make it short .. although Free Bird
 the Sysop of the excellent TDT BBS... deserves much praise and more time.
  Some school kids, (maybe local College kids) were caught hacking into
 their school computer. To cop a plea they turned in the Lite House BBS.
  This is in FLorida, so the local pigs decided to make an example of
 Free Bird. They Busted down his door and ARRESTED his Hardware, and took
 Free Bird down to the Station, questionned and then released him.
  He says he is facing 120 years in Jail and many THOUSANDS of dollars in
 Fines.
  The Pigs have already TAKEN his about 4-5 node, 4 Gig BBS, + Gig BACKUP
 Tapes etc etc... and ALL info on his BBS is now in PIG Hands...
 at least the FBI has NOT been called , they think ,, so far..

   ****IF YOU WERE A USER ON THAT BBS.. AND USE THE SAME HANDLES AND
   PASSWORDS ON OTHER BBS'S... ***CHANGE THEM IMMEDIATLY !!!!!******

  Note this fact... in CLintonian AMerica in the Free 1990's..

     THE HAVE FROZEN FREE BIRDS CHECKING ACCOUNT .... !!!!

    DO THEY DO THIS WITH **CONVICTED MURDERERSS???   I dont think so !!!

 HE HAS NOT been TRIED OR CONVICTED .. and ALREADY .. FREE BIRD has LOST
 his SYSTEM Sysops YOU Know how much a BBS like that costs??? What...$10,000
 with all the computers, nodes, Cards, LAN, HW etc,etc,modems.
 AND WITH HIS BANK ACCOUNT FROZEN He's got some explaining to do to his
 WIFE and KIDS and PARENTS and FAMILY and maybe EMPLOYER !!!

 Section [9]: PHANTASY TIDBITS: News and Views of Interest

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 ALPHA AXP SYSTEMS AVAILABLE ON INTERNET

  On Thursday April 29, 1993 -- As a service to the Internet
 community, Digital Equipment Corporation has made two DEC 4000 AXP
 systems available for evaluating the Alpha AXP architecture and
 testing the functionality of the supporting operating systems,
 compilers, tools, and utilities.

  Application developers who have access to the Internet can use
 these two systems to test, qualify, or port their software for the
 Alpha AXP architecture.  Other Internet users interested in Alpha
 AXP computing are invited to log on and evaluate these systems.

  In the first two days of availability, initial Internet
 response resulted in well over 1000 accounts from about 500
 organizations being set up on these Alpha AXP systems.

  One DEC 4000 AXP system (Internet address: axposf.pa.dec.com)
 is running the DEC OSF/1 for AXP V1.2 UNIX operating system. The
 other AXP system (Internet address: axpvms.pa.dec.com) has the
 OpenVMS AXP V1.5 operating system installed.  These systems can be
 reached either via telnet or rlogin.

  To register for an account, Internet users connect to the
 desired machine, log in as axpguest (no password), and answer the
 short qualifying questionnaire.  Users are asked to read all
 information in the motd/login banner and comply with all rules for
 machine usage/restrictions.  Customers with questions about their
 accounts should send mail to Internet address:
 axposf-root@dec.pa.com for the DEC OSF/1 for AXP system and to
 Internet address: axpvms-system@pa.dec.com for the OpenVMS AXP
 system.

  The Internet system -- linking more than 1.7 million host
 computers on 11,000 networks in 50 countries -- has more than 5
 million users.  The system is tied into most public and private
 electronic messaging services, expanding the user population able to
 exchange electronic mail to about 15 million people.  The system is
 doubling annually in users, networks, hosts, and traffic.

                         TAIWAN QUICK TO REACT

  The government of Taiwan (under pressure from the U.S.) passed the final two
 bills providing copyright protection for the United States.
  This was done to avoid possible trade sanctions under the special 301 Section
 of the Omnibus Trade Act.
  The U.S. had given Taiwan until April 30th to pass the bills, which have been
 a matter of friction between the U.S. and Taiwan.
  As of third week of April, the U.S. had not removed Taiwan from its list of
 countries that sanctions may be imposed against.
  If Taiwan is not taken off the "301 List", there will be a 100% tariff on all
 Taiwanese computer and peripheral equipment.

                          VLSI BEHIND CLIPPER CHIP

  VLSI Technology Inc has added a new manufacturing process and a library of
 electronic building blocks that will provide data-encryption capability.
  The new manufacturing process and design support has been developed by VLSI
 to build the "Clipper" chip for Mykotronx in Torrance California.
  The "Clipper" chip will be used by Mykotronx for secure communications
 equipment applications.
  Any data that is designed-in through VLSI's proprietary FSB library and tools
 will offer protection from visual and electrical probing techniques.
  VLSI sees their process being used in telephones,video games, and cable tv
 with a possible market share of 100 million by 1996.

                COPS SEIZE HOME COMPUTER IN RUDE SIGN CASE

  Connecticut State Police from the Westport,Ct. barracks raided a house in
 Stratford,Ct at 64 Bowe Avenue on Tuesday April thirteenth.
  The police armed with a search and seizure warrant confiscated a computer
 belonging to one Keith Blodgett.
  It seems Keith was responsible for those darling messages on Interstate-95
 that we reported to you in Phantasy Issue 16.
  Apparently Keith hacked into the Connecticut State Department of
 Transportations computer and re-programmed the electronic sign on I-95 to
 display "Weiker Blows,You all have a Nice Day" and "You All Suck" on
 different occasions.
  We admire Keith's political views, but he shold have known better than to
 keep hacking into the system after all the publicity.

           IM SORRY SIR, WE CAN'T LAND, BILL'S HAIR IS A MESS

  On May 20th,1993 the ultimate in stupidity occured at the L.A. International
 Airport. Several flights were denied clearance to land because Slick Willie
 was having his hair done in Air Force One on the tarmac.
  Beverly Hills hairdresser Cristophe spent about an hour primping and poofing
 Bill's thinning locks. Meanwhile wayward travelers were kept in limbo circling
 the airport.
  HEY BILL, You don't look any Better and you just lost a shitload of
 re-election votes. I hope your hair was worth it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       ATM SCAM - A TEXT BOOK OPERATION

  As many of you may have heard, a succesful ATM scam was pulled off at the
 Buckland Hills Mall in Manchester,Ct.
  Of course the media had an Over-Hype field day claiming this was a first
 in ATM history.. Give us a break I've seen this scam portrayed on tv shows
 its so old.
  At last check the crooks have made away with $60,000 dollars plus and
 despite Secret Service claims of an arrest within 48 hours on May 17th,
 none have been made as of a week later.
  Basically the scam was this, the thieves placed an ATM inside the courtyard
 of the mall with enough seed money to entice shoppers into complacency.
  After sabotaging 1 of the malls 2 legitimate machines the thieves racked
 up hundreds of card information and PINS after shoppers used the bogus
 machine.
  With this information they've been running around the country with
 forged copies of the cards and withdrwaing cash.
  We'll bring you a complete story in Phantasy Issue #18.
