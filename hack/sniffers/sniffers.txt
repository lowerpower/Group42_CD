I have not heard of a sniffer over a modem line, it seems kind 
of pointless, as you would have to on one of the connections 
points.  Sniffers are usually (though not always, if you want 
to fork out the dough!) software applications.  

>  How does it work?  

Networks communicate with each other using something called a 
packet.  A packet contains all the addressing info, control, 
error checking etc required by a network to deliver packet.  
Also included would be the data.

On local area networks, packets are broadcast to all nodes 
(read, computers) on the network (local, not internet!).  Each 
node will read the address in the packet.  If the packet is 
addressed to the node, the node reads it, otherwise it ignores 
it.

A sniffer is a program that makes a copy of the packet and 
stores the contents somewhere else (a file) for later perusal 
by the user of the sniffer.  By scanning through the file, it 
is possible to see the data being transfered, which can be 
passwords, but is 99.999% of the time data.

  It should also be noted that most networks also come equiped 
with software versions of ehternet sniffers, for use by the 
adminitrators.

Hardware sniffers (lan-a-lizers) are devices that can be 
plugged into a network via a port and are used to read the 
packets for diagnostic information.

>What effect does encrypted data have on

Packets themselves are not encrypted, as they need to be read 
by all nodes on the net.  Encrypting the data however, means 
that the data inside the packet is unreadable (unless, you can 
decrypt it)

It should be noted that packets send on the internet are not 
broadcast to all nodes (what a mess that would make!!).  They 
use a method called store and forward, where the packet is send 
from server to server until it reaches its destination points 
(only the servers in the path to the destination receive the 
packet)  Please note that server is braod... it can be any 
number of devices on the net... routers, gateways, file servers 
to name a few.

Hope that helped (I think it is all essentially correct.. I am 
kinda tired right now)

A good book on internet communications/programming would be:

Internmet Programming by Kris Jamsa, PHD and Ken Cope
Jamsa Press, isbn 1 884133-12-6

I can't think of any good titles on lans, though any library 
will have lots of resources.

	A packet sniffer, as I said before, is not 'placed' on a 
	communications medium.  The are usally software on a device
	the packets travel through.  They can be hardware, however.

	Depends what layer you are talking about.  Sure, link and physical 
	layers uses packets (some term the physical as bits, and the link
	as packets, but I don't make that distinction).  Network layers
	use datagrams, transports layers use segments...

	No,no,no.  On ETHERNETS they are.  Token ring networks,
	for example, DO NOT broadcasts packets in this manner.  Token
	Ring is a deterministic system.  It is nice and orderly and
	it passes a nice token around, checking to see if anyone has 
	any data to send or recieve.

	No.  Read my previous sniffer post.  It has information on 
	link-to-link and end-to-end encryption.

	Again no.  Store and forward (message-switching) techniques are 
	not the predominant form of routing on the Internet.  UUCP uses this 
	form of routing, and is intended for dial-up links, and is slowly 
	being phased out.  UUCP is a seperate group of protocols and is NOT
	in TCP/IP.  The predominant form of routing on the Internet is 
	packet-switching.  Data is broken down into datagrams and switched
	from device to device until it reaches it destination, normally
	with no reliability...

	If anyone really wants, I can go into depth on packet switching...?
