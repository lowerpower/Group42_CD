This document describes how the Checkpoint resonant tag system may work
(record and clothing stores).  The following data is provided for 
informational purposes only, and no guarantee is made to the accuracy
of the contained information. 
<p>
These systems appear to rely on a resonant tank circuit that is responsive
to signals from about 8500-9100 khz.  The signal appears to be swept between
these two values (at least from the point of being received on a shortwave
radio).  The change in the signal profile generated by a high Q tank circuit
is what sets this type of alarm system off.  Resonant tanks built for these
frequencies will set of checkpoint alarm systems.
<h3> Advantages </h3>
<p>
Tags have no active components, disposables can be deactivated electronically
in a manner that is not injurious to magnetic products.
<h3> Disadvantages </h3>
<p>
Very easy to defeat tags, some falsing problems due to other items being 
resonant in the detection band. Coils must be close together and can 
interfere with store exit layout.
