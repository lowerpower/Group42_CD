This document describes how the Sensormatic electrostatic/electromagnetic
electronic alarm systems work.  (record and clothing stores).
The following data is provided for informational purposes only,
and no guarantee is made to the accuracy of the contained information.
<p>
These systems work on a mixer principle.  In the control area (typically
at the exit of a store) a 915 Mhz radio signal and an approximately 100
khz modulated electric field signal is radiated into the control zone.
The tags (which consist of a schottky barrier diode or PIN diode between
two antenna elements) generate a signal which is the original 915 Mhz
signal modulated with the 100khz signal.  
<p>
This modulated signal is detected, and sets off the alarm.
<p>
Some relevant patents to the method are US 4642640  and US 4139844.
The system described in patent US 5349332 describes a very sophisticated
implementation of this idea.
<h3> Advantages </h3>
<p>
System has high pick rate, large exit zone, controllable transition zone.
Good resistance to false signals, tags can be deactivated in a manner that
doesn't damage magnetic materials.  Newer reusable tags are quite light and
don't interfere with customer handling of product.
<h3> Disadvantages </h3>
<p>
Use of active components in tags could increase cost of these items. Disposables
possibly vulnerable to ESD.
