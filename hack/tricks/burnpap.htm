<h2>Reading Burned Paper</h2>
by Codemaster of Group 42
</center>
<br>
Writing on charred or partially burned paper can somtimes be made legible
by photographic or chemical methods.
<p>
First off, never attempt to save the paper from the file if it is already
being burned.  Chances are that the burnt section of the paper will
seperate and become lost.  Extinguish the filer without moving the paper
and allow the paper to burn out completely.
<p>
The material must be collected with great care so that the burned papaer
is not broken.  If the burned material consists of a book, folded papers,
or currency, no attempt should be made to separate the different layers of
paper.  If transportation is necessary, use a wooden or strong cardboard
box in which the material is cushioned by cotton or other soft material.
Another method is to place the material in an airtight plastic bag which
is carefully blown up and sealed with a rubber band.
<p>
If for some reason you cannot transport the material without breaking it
up, spray the material with a fixing medium such as shellac solution, a
solution of celluloid in Ayml Acetone, or a 1% solution of gelatine
water.  use a small piece of the material to test the solution,  This
way the concentration of the solution can be changed if necessary before
spraying the entire material.  If the above solution process is used
it will be impossible to use a chemical method in determining legible
writing.  Thus, only the photographic method can be used.
<p>
Using photography with infrared sensitive plates can, in many cases,
make the writing legible, even if the material has already been chemically
treated.  When handling or photographing the material it should be enclosed
between two pieces of glass.
<p>
Typewriting and printing can often be read in specular light.  A silver
nitrate solution can also be used, making it easier to read.  In order
to make the paper easier to handle it may be treated with a 10-20%
Glycerine solution for this method.  Certain chemicals can be used on
the material to make the writing legible in some cases, such as a 60%
Chloral Hydrate solution, a 5-10% Silber Nitrate solution, or a
Potasium Perrocyanide soultion.  These chemicals are inapplicable to
typewriting, however.
<p>
When using the chemical solutions, use a large flat-bottomed dish
and place a piece of glass at the bottom of the dish.  The burnt
paper is then laid in the solution and allowed to sink down to
the glass.  Then gently remove the solution and place another
piece of glass over the burnt paper.  This flattens the paper
and allows it to be examined more carefully.
