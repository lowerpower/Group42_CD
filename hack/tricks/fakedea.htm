<h2>Detecting Fake Perscriptions</h2>
by Nickle of Group 42

<br>
Passing fake perscriptions is a big time no-no so don't do it.  This
information is just to tell you how it is done and how you can spot
fakes.
<p>
Any doctor practicing in the United States is given an ID number
by the Drug Enforcement Agency.  It is called a DEA Number.  Below
is the specific formula that can be used to verify a doctor's
DEA Number.
<p>
The number has the following format: A L 1 2 3 4 5 6 7<p>
Where:
<ul>
<li>A = A, any doctor that is allowd to prescribe controlled substances will
        have a DEA number that starts with A.
<li>L = the first Letter of the doctors Last name.
<li>Numbers 1-6 can be any number.
<li>Number 7 has to be calculated by takeing the ones digit of the number
        calculated by (1+3+5)+((2+4+6)*2).
</ul>
<h4>DEA Number Example</h4>
Lets say you have a perscription from a DR. Dillweed, on his perscription
form it reports that his DEA number is <b>AD1269984</b>.  You would
calculate the last digit by adding the first, third, and fifth number
(1+6+9=16) and adding this to the sum times two of the second, forth,
and sixth number (2+9+8=19*2=38).  This would give you (16+38) 54.  The
ones digit of 54 is 4 and the seventh digit of Dr. Dillweed's DEA
number is 4 so there is a good chance that his perscription is valid.
<p>
<h4>Other info</h4>
Simply photocopying perscriptions, then using some desk top publishing
program and a laser printer you can make as many forms as you want.  You
could also scan the Dr's signature and print it out very lightly and
trace over it with a pen, or print it out with a color printer.  Copying
a color printer output with a color photo copy machine will soften
the document and make it look more real.
<p>
Be warned though that some of the heavier drugs are what doctors call
triplicate, where the perscription form is filled out in triplicate.
You will get busted if you try to pass of a regular perscription form
for these drugs.
<p>
Drugs like antibiotics shouldn't rase any pharmisists eybrows, although
for antibiotics you would be safer to go to a feed supply store and
buy antibiotics ment for animals.
