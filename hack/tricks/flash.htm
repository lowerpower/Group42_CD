<h2>Making and Using Flash Paper</h2>
by Nickle of Group 42
</center>
<br>
In the old days bookies, always edgy about raids, started using a technique
where a liquid was placed on their blank bet sheets and let to dry.
When it was dry the bookie would take down the bet information on this
paper.  When a raid happened, the bookie would throw all the slips in
a trash can and put a match to it.  Within a fraction of a second the
paper was turned into ash and thus no evidence, hence the birth
of <b>Flash Paper</b>.
<p>
You can use this method to protect you papers from whomever, just
go down to a magic supply store and ask for flash paper or a
commercially made liquid to make your own.  Alternativly you can
go to a chemical supply store house and obtain some Potassium
Nitrate (also known as Saltpeter.)  Mix this chemical in water,
using as much of the chemical that will dissolve in water and then
dip you paper in this solution and let dry.
<p>
Bookies today still may use this method, but another method they use
is chalk and dry erasable marker boards.  If a raid takes place they
simply wipe their chalk or marker board down eraseing the information.
<p>
Methods like these are becomming less and less necessary since the
advent of high powered computers and crypto software.  Using a computer
and crypto software like secure drive/device a bookie could keep
the information on his computer on an encrypted drive and simply
turn off his computer during a raid.  If the bookie had selected
his pass phrase correctly and took precautions about using swap files
and other common security leaks the police, FBI, or other govenment agency
would have little chance on opening up the encrypted drive.
