<h2>Making and Using Transparent Letter Spray</h2>
by Nickle of Group 42
</center>
<br>
Sold at most <i>spy supply</i> stores for about $30 dollars a can under
names such as <i>The Leter Bomb Visualizer</i>, transparent letter
spray turns most paper it comes in contact with transparent allowing
someone to peek through an envelope to see or read what is inside.
<p>
Although it is sold as one way to detect a letter bomb placed in
an envelope or similar package, most <i>spy supply</i> sales people
will hint to you that you will be able to read what's inside of an
envelope without leaving any indications of doing so.
<p>
One simply sprays the liquid on the envelope and the contents become
visible through the envelope.  Approximately ten seconds later, the
liquid dries off leaving no trace.
<p>
Well the trick is that this transparent letter spray is nothing other
than liquid freon.  You can save yourself about $29 by going to
a film retailer store an purchaseing some liquid freon.  Pour the
freon in an old spray bottle and use as necessary :')
<p>
<i>A word of caution though:  A lot of people get carried away when using
the transparent letter spray for the first time and inhaling
liquid freon over a period of time can cause nausea and related sicknesses.
So be carefull and use in a well-ventilated area.
