<h2>Detecting Two-Way Mirrors</h2>
by Nickle of Group 42
</center>
<br>
If you have ever been busted by the pheds you will notice there
is always a large mirror in the room, most likly with a camera
recording the goings on.
<p>
To check to see if a mirror is an ordanary mirror or a two way mirror
place the point of an ordinary pencil to the surface of the mirror
and observe the reflection.  If the reflection of the pencil <i>
touches</i> the pencil, it is a very good bet that it is a two-way
mirror through which you can be observed from the other side.
<p>
If there is a distance of about 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch between the
actual point and the reflected image you can be 99% sure that it is
a one-way mirror.
<p>
In the cases where you don't have a pencil, a finger can work, it is
just harder to determine if it is a thin one-way mirror or a two-way
mirror.
