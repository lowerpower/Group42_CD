<i>Video Scrambling and Descrambling for Satellite and Cable TV</i> by
Rudolf F. Graf and William Sheets (ISBN 0-672-22499-2) US$20.00. 
Published in 1987, it is somewhat dated but is useful for understanding
what is happening when a video signal is scrambled.  Covered topics
include SSAVI, gated sync, sine wave, subcarrier recovery, outband,
VideoCipher II, B-MAC, etc.  246 pages.

<h3>Scrambling_Technologies</h3>

<h4>Traps (Traps/Addressable Taps)</h4>
A cable system may not be scrambled at all. Some older systems (and many
apartment complexes) use <i>traps</i> or <i>filters</i> which actually
<b>remove</b> the
signals you aren't paying for from your cable. (These are negative traps
because they remove the WHOLE signal.) These systems are relatively
secure because the traps are often located in locked boxes, and once
a service technician finds out they're missing or have been tampered
with (by pushing a pin through a coax trap it to change its frequency,
for example), it's a pretty solid piece of evidence for prosecution.
Another method is where the head-end ADDS an extraneous signal about
2.5 MHz above the normal visual carrier which causes a tuner to think
its receiving a very strong signal--the tuner then adjust the automatic
gain control and buries the real signal. If you pay for the service, the
cable company adds a <i>positive trap</i> which then REMOVES the extraneous
injected signal so it becomes viewable. (This system is very easy to
circumvent by building your own notch filter, so it is not very commonly
used.) Advantages to a cable system with this technology is that you
don't need a cable box--all your cable-ready TVs, VCRs, etc. will all
work beautifully. The disadvantage is that pay-per-view events are not
possible, and that every time someone requests a change in service, a
technician has to be dispatched to add/remove the traps.
<p>
An article for building a tunable notch filter to block data 
streams sent just above the FM band was in the April 1992 issue of
Radio-Electronics (pp. 37-39). Notch filters (as well as kits for
them) for other frequencies are frequently advertised in Nuts & Volts
magazines as <i>beep</i> filters and the like.
<p>
Becoming more and more popular, not only because of the Cable Act of
1992 but also in an effort to stop <i>pirates</i> are addressable taps. Many
cable companies will be moving to this technology in the near future,
(which they call <i>interdiction</i>). These are devices located at the pole,
where your individual cable feed is tapped from the head-end. Similar
to addressable converters, they each have a unique ID number and can be
turned on/off by a computer at the head-end. Any stations which you are
not paying for are filtered out by electronicly switchable traps in the
units. (Including the whole signal if you haven't paid your bill or had
the service disconnected.) {Several patents have already been issued for
various methods of making SURE you don't see a channel you don't pay
for.} Again, these almost <b>guarantee</b> an end to piracy and don't have any
of the disadvantages of the manual traps. Plus, they provide a superior
signal to those customers paying for service because they no longer need
complicated cable boxes or A/B switches -- and they can finally use all
of the <i>cable-ready</i> capabilites of the VCR, TV, etc. About the only
known attack on this type of system is to splice into a neighbors cable,
which again provides plenty of physical evidence for prosecution.

<h3>Sine-Wave</h3>
Early Oak (and some very early Pioneer boxes) employed a sine-wave sync
suppresion system. In this system, the picture would remain vertically
stable, but wiggling black bars with white on either side would run
down the center of the screen. The lines were caused by a 15,750 Hz
sine-wave being injected with the original signal, causing the sync
separator in the TV to be unable to detect and separate the sync pulses.
Later, Oak came out with a <i>Vari-Sync</i> model, which also removed a
31,500 Hz sine-wave added to the signal. Oak was one of the first to
use extra signals (<i>tags</i>) as a counter-measure for pirate boxes -- in
the normal mode, a short burst of a 100 KHz sine-wave (the tag signal)
would be sent during the VBI, along with the AM sine-wave reference
on the audio carrier and scrambled video. They would then put the AM
sine-wave reference signal onto the audio carrier, leave the video
alone, and NOT send the tag. Any box which simply looked for the AM
sine-wave reference would effectively scramble the video by adding a
sine-wave to the unscrambled video! Real decoders looked for the tag
signal and still worked correctly. Other combinations of tag/no tag,
scrambled/unscrambled video were also possible.

<h3>6 dB In-Band Sync Suppression</h3>
Early Jerrold boxes used in-band gated sync suppression. The horizontal
blanking interval was suppressed by 6 dB. A 15.734, 31.468 or 94.404
KHz reference signal (conveniently all even multiples of the horizontal
sync frequency) was modulated on the sound carrier of the signal, and
used to reconstruct the sync pulse. An article in February 1984 issue
of Radio-Electronics explains this somewhat-old technique. Converters
which have been known to use this system include the Scientific-Atlanta
8500-321/421, a number of Jerrold systems [see numbering chart], Jerrold
SB-#, SB-#-200, SB-#A, RCA KSR53DA, Sylvania 4040 and Magnavox Magna
6400.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>Tri-mode In-Band Sync Suppression</h3>
A modification to the 6dB sync suppresion system, dubbed <i>tri-mode</i>,
allows for 0, 6 and 10 dB suppression of the horizontal sync pulse. The
three sync levels can be varied at random (as fast as once per field),
and the data necessary to decode the signal is contained in unused lines
during the VBI (along with other information in the cable data stream.)
See the February 1987 issue of Radio-Electronics for a good article
(both theory and schematics) on the tri-mode system. Converters which
have been known to use this system include a number of Jerrold systems
[see numbering chart], Jerrold SBD-#A, SBD-#DIC, Jerrold Starcom VI
(DP5/DPV models), Regency, Scientific- Atlanta 8550-321 and early
Pioneer systems.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>Out-Band Sync Suppression</h3>
Out-band gated sync systems also exist, such as in early Hamlin
converters. In this system, the reference signal is located on an
unused channel, usually towards the higher end (channels in the 40's
and 50's are common, but never in the low 30's due to potential false
signalling.) The signal is comprised of only sync pulse information
without any video. Tuning in such a channel will show nothing but a
white screen and will usually have no audio.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>SSAVI / ZTAC</h3>
SSAVI is an acronym for Synchronization Suppression and Active Video
Inversion and is most commonly found on Zenith converters. ZTAC is an
acronym for Zenith Tiered Addressable Converter. Besides suppressing
sync pulses in gated-sync fashion, video inversion is used to yield
four scrambling modes (suppressed sync, normal video; suppressed sync,
inverted video; normal sync, inverted video; and normal sync, normal
video).<p>
The horizontal sync pulses of an SSAVI signal can be absent
completely, at the wrong level, or even present, and can be varied on
a field-by-field basis. Any decoder for an SSAVI (or similar) system
has to be able to separate a video line into its two basic components--
the control and picture signals. In SSAVI, the horizontal sync is never
inverted, even if the picture is. So a method of inverting the picture
without inverting the control section is necesary. This is complicated
by the fact that almost every line in an SSAVI signal has no horizontal
sync information, making it difficult to perform the separation (since
the usual reference point--the horizontal sync pulse--is gone).
<p>
In the
older suppressed-sync system, the sync pulse could be recovered from the
gating signal buried in the audio subcarrier, but SSAVI is <i>pilotless</i>.
The key to this system relies on the strict timings imposed by the NTSC
standard--if you can locate one part of the signal accurately, you
can determine where everything else should be mathematically. Since
the cable company is sending a digital data stream---the security and
access-rights--during the VBI of the signal, the VBI makes a great place
to find a known point in the signal. Obviously if the electronics in the
cable box can locate this information, so can electronics outside the
cable box! :-)
<p>
The only constant in the SSAVI system are the horizontal sync pulses
during the VBI (the first 26 lines of video), which are sent "in the
clear". The pulses from the VBI can be used as a reference for a
phase-locked loop (PLL) and used to supply the missing pulses for the
rest of the video frame. With 20 or so reliable pulses at the beginning
of each frame, you can accurately generate the missing 240 or so pulses.
Of the 26 lines in the VBI, lines zero through nine are left alone by
request of the FCC, lines 10 to 13 are commonly used to transmit a
digital data stream, line 21 contains closed-caption information, while
other lines are used for a variety of <i>stuff</i> depending on the cable
system and the channel you're watching. When you tune to a scrambled
channel with a cable box, logic circuits in the unit count the video
lines, read the transmitted data stream, and compare the transmitted
data with the information stored in the box. If the box is authorized
to receive the signal with that particular data stream, the decoder
is enabled and the scrambled signal becomes viewable. If not, the
signal is passed through without being decoded, or more commonly, a
<i>barker</i> channel (whose channel number is sent via the data stream) is
automatically tuned instead. This prevents people from using the unit
as a tuner for <i>add-on descramblers</i> often advertised in the back of
electronics magazines.
<p>
In the SSAVI system, the video can be sent with either normal or
inverted picture information. The descrambler needs a way to determine
whether to invert the video or not. Originally this information could
be found on line 20, but has since moved around a lot as the popularity
(and knowledge) of the system increased. In any event, the last half of
the line would tell the decoder whether to invert the picture or not. If
the rest of the field was not inverted, the last half of the line would
be black. If the video in the rest of the frame was inverted, the last
half of the line would be white.
<p>
The Drawing Board column of Radio-Electronics starting in August '92
and going through May '93 described the system and provided several
circuits for use on an SSAVI system. Note that audio in the system can
be <i>scrambled</i> - usually by burying it on a subcarrier that's related
mathematically to the IF component of the signal.
<p>
Addressable data for Zentih systems is sent in the VBI, lines 10-13,
with 26 bits of data per line.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>Tocom systems</h3>
The Tocom system is similar to the Zenith system since it provides three
levels of addressable baseband scrambling: partial video inversion,
random dynamic sync suppression and random dynamic video inversion.
Data necessary to recover the signal is encrypted and sent during lines
17 and 18 of the VBI (along with head-end supplied teletext data for
on-screen display). The control signal contains 92 bits, and is a 53 ms
burst sent just after the color burst. Up to 32 tiers of scrambling can
be controlled from the head-end. Audio is not scrambled.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>New Pioneer systems</h3>
The newer 6000-series converters from Pioneer supposedly offer one
of the most secure CATV scrambling technologies from a <i>major</i> CATV
equipment supplier. From the very limited information available on the
system, it appears that false keys, pseudo-keys and both in-band and
out-band signals are used in various combinations for a secure system.
From U.S. patent abstract #5,113,441 which was issued to Pioneer in
May '92 (and may or may not be used in the 6000-series converters, but
could be), "An audio signal is used on which a key signal containing
compression information and informaton concerning the position of a
vertical blanking interval is superimposed on a portion of the audio
signal corresponding to a horizontal blanking interval. In addition,
a pseudo-key signal is superimposed...so that the vertical blanking
interval cannot be detected through the detection of the audio signal...
Descrambling can be performed by detecting the vertical blanking
interval based on the information...in the key signal, and decoding
the information for the position which is transmitted in the form of
out-band data. Compression information can then be extracted from
the key signal based on the detected vertical blanking interval, and
an expansion signal for expanding the signal in the horizontal and
vertical blanking periods can be generated."
<p>
Note that Pioneer boxes are <i>booby-trapped</i> and opening the unit will
release a spring-mechanism which positively indicates access was gained
to the interior (and sends a signal to the head-end on a two-way system,
and may disable the box completely.) {See U.S. patent #4,149,158 for
details.} The unit cannot be reset without a special device.
<p>
Pioneer systems transmit their addressing data on 110.0 MHz, and there
are several programmable <i>cubes</i> that can activate these systems.
<p>
The data is a manchester I encoded FSK signal at ~6kHz data rate,
this data is easly readable using software developed by Group 42
that will be available on the next release of this disc.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>New Scientific-Atlanta Systems</h3>
Some of the early S-A boxes used 6 dB only sync suppression (some of
the 8500 models), and some of the 8550 boxes are tri-mode systems.
The three digit number after the model (such as 321) is a code which
indicates the make of the descrambler in the unit. Apparently some of
the newer S-A boxes use a technique called <i>dropfield</i>, and some
of the newer 8600 and 8570 models use baseband methods (see Jerrold
Baseband below).
<p>
Scientific-Atlanta systems transmit their FSK addressing data on 106.2 or
108.2 MHz.  There are several programmable <i>cubes</i> that can activate
these systems.  On the newest 8600 systems the the addression data is
hidden elsewhere, possibly the video blanking region.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>Oak <i>Sigma</i> Systems</h3>
This a secure system which replaces the horizontal sync of each line
of video with a three-byte digital word. Video is switched from
inverted to non-inverted between scene changes, and the colorburst
frequency is shifted <i>up</i>. This is a standard <i>suppressed</i> sync
video scrambling method and is relatively simple to defeat with the
appropriate circuitry. HOWEVER, the three-byte digital word in the
area where the sync normally is contains audio and sync information.
The first two bytes contain a digitized versions of the audio, the
third byte contains sync information (and perhaps addressing data?) The
two bytes of digitized audio are encrypted; a separate carrier signal
contains the decryption keys for the digital audio datastream.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>Jerrold Baseband (dpbb and CFT model units)</h3>
Jerrold has gone one step further in scrambling the signal at the
baseband level.  Other less complicated methods like tri-mode scramble
the signal at the RF level (ie. the channel 73 signal is scrambled when
the signal is already modulated on channel 73.)  With baseband scrambling
the signal is scrambled, then modulated on the desired channel.  Using
this method the scrambling device has more control and more complicated
methods can be used.<p>
The most popular way to defeat these systems is to use a <i>test chip</i>
or a cube device to activate the original Jerrold equiptment.  Addon
descramblers are more difficult to build since you have to convert
the signal to baseband levels, descramble, then remodulate the singnal.
<p>
Cable Companies have been experementing with several new methods of
defeating test chips and cubes, most notably is the use of <i>Multi
Mode</i> and adding an extra checksum byte in the FSK data packet
format.  Pirates are starting to clone cable companies test boxes
to get around the most problem areas of multi mode and newer test
chips and cubes are getting smarter to combat both multimode and
the extra checksum bytes.
<p>

<h3>Chameleon</h3>
The research and development division of Fundy Cable Ltd., NCA
Microelectronics, has a systemd dubbed <i>Chameleon</i>. They claim it is
a cost-effective solution that prevents pay TV theft by digitally
encrypting the video timing information of sync suppression systems. The
company claims the technology has been proven to be effective against
pirate and tampered boxes. Supposedly, existing decoders can be upgraded
to Chameleon technology with a low-cost add-in circuit, and that the
card's sealed custom IC, developed by NCA, is copy-proof.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>VideoCipher</h3>
The VideoCipher system is now owned by General Instrument and is used
primarily for satellite signals at this time. VideoCipher I is the
"commercial" version which uses DES (Data Encryption Standard)-encrypted
audio AND video. A VCI descrambler is not available for "home" owners.
VideoCipher II is the now-obsolete system which used a relatively simple
video encryption method with DES-encrypted audio. (Specifically, the
audio is 15 bit PCM, sampled at ~44.1 KHz. It is mu-law companded to
10 bits before transmission.) This has recently been replaced by the
VideoCipher II+, which has been incorporated as the 'default' encryption
method used by VideoCipher IIRS (a smart-card based, upgradeable
system). Supposedly, coded data relating to the digitized, encrypted
audio is sent in the area normally occupied by the horizontal sync
pulse in the VCII system. (The Oak Sigma CATV system uses a similar
technology.) Several methods existed for pirating the VCII based system,
and some SUPPOSEDLY exist for the new VCII+ format, although this has
never been verified.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<h3>DigiCable/DigiCipher</h3>
DigiCipher is an <i>upcoming</i> technology being developed by General
Instrument for use in both NTSC and HDTV environments. The DigiCipher
format is for use on satellites, and the DigiCable variation will
address CATV needs. It provides compression algorithms with forward
error correction modulation techniques to allow up to 10 "entertainment
quality" NTSC channels in the space normally occupied by one channel.
It provides true video encryption (as opposed to the VCII-series which
only DES encrypts the audio). In a Multiple Channel Per Carrier (MCPC)
application, the data rate is ~27 MB/second via offset QPSK modulation.
Audio is CD-quality through Dolby AC-2 technology, allowing up to four
audio channels per video channel. The system uses renewable security
cards (like the VCIIRS), has 256 bits of <i>tier</i> information, copy
protection capability to prevent events from being recorded, commercial
insertion capability for CATV companies, and more. The multichannel NTSC
satellite version of DigiCipher started testing in July of 1992, and
went into production several months later.

<h3>B-MAC</h3>
MAC is an acronym for Mixed Analog Components. It refers to placing TV
sound into the horizontal-blanking interval, and then separating the
color and luminance portions of the picture signal for periods of 20
to 40 microseconds each. In the process, luminance and chrominance are
compressed during transmission and expanded during reception, enlarging
their bandwidths considerably. Transmitted as FM, this system, when used
in satellite transmission, provides considerably better TV definition
and resoluton. Its present parameters are within the existing NTSC
format, but is mostly used in Europe at this time.
<p>
<hr size=5 noshade>
<h2>Miscellaneous Information</h2>
<h3>Two-Piece vs. One-Piece</h3>
There are both advantages and disadvantages to the one-piece and
two-piece descramblers often advertised in the back of electronics
magazines. Most <i>one-piece units</i> are real cable converters, just
like you'd get if you rented one from the cable company. It has the
advantages of <i>real</i> descrambling circuitry and the ability to
<i>fit-in</i>
well when neighbors come over (avoids those <i>my box doesn't look like
that...or get all these channels!</i> conversations. A disadvantage is
that if you move or the cable company installs new hardware, you may now
have a worthless box -- most one-piece units only work on the specific
system they were designed for. Another disadvantage is that if the box
has not been modified, it can be very easy for the head-end to disable
the unit completely. (See Market Codes & Bullets, below.)
<p>
A <i>two-piece unit (combo)</i> usually consists of an any-brand cable TV
tuner with a third-party <i>descrambler</i> (often referred to as a <i>pan</i>)
which is designed to work with a specific scrambling technology. The
descrambler typically connects to the channel 3 output of the tuner,
and has a channel 3 output which connects to your TV. (Although some
tuners have a <i>decoder loop</i> for such devices.) They have the advantage
that if you move or your system is upgraded, you can try to purchase a
new descrambler -- which is much cheaper than a whole new set-up. You
also can select the cable TV tuner with the features you want (remote,
volume control, parental lockout, baseband video output, etc.) Two-piece
units typically cannot be disabled by the data stream on your cable.
(Note however that there ARE add-on <i>pans</i> manufactured by the same
companies who make the one-piece units that DO pay attention to the data
stream and can be disabled similarly!) The main disadvantage is that a
third-party descrambler MAY not provide as high of quality descrambling
as <i>the real thing</i>, and it may arrouse <i>suspicion</i> if someone
notices your <i>cable thing</i> is different from theirs.

</pre>

Also note that some Jerrold converters (particularly the DP5 series
and some CFTs) have a tamper-switch, and that opening the box will
clear the contents of a RAM chip in the converter. This may or may not
be corrected by letting the unit get <i>refreshed</i> by the head-end
FSK data stream.
<p>
Most Jerrold systems in the United States and Canada transmit their
addressing data on 97.5, 106.5 or
108.5 MHz.  Some DPV7 and DPBB7 models have S7, S8, or S9 as
the last numbers on there modle numbers, these correlate to 97.5,
106.5 and 108.5 Mhz directly.  CFT model numbers almost always
use 108.5Mhz.  DPV5 and older units mostly use 106.5Mhz.
In Europe 122.75 Mhz seems to be the addressing frequency used,
at least in several parts of Jolly old England.
<p>
The datastream is Manchester II encoded FSK, with approximately
a 14kHz clock.  And is fully readable with software developed
by Group 42 available on a future relase of this disc.

<p>

<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3>Market Codes</h3>
Note that almost every addressable decoder in use today has a unique
<i>serial number</i> programmed into the unit -- either in a PROM,
non-volatile RAM, EAROM, etc. This allows the head-end to send commands
specifically to a certain unit (to authorize a pay-per-view events, for
example.) Part of this <i>serial number</i> is what is commonly called a
<i>market code</i>, which can be used to uniquely identify a certain cable
company. This prevents an addressable decoder destined for use in
Chicago from being used in Houston. In most cases, when a box receives a
signal with a different market code, it will enter an <i>error mode</i> and
become unusable. This is just a friendly little note to anyone who might
consider purchasing a unit from the back of a magazine -- if the unit
has not been <i>modified</i> in any way to prevent such behavior, you could
end up with an expensive paper weight... (see next section)

<h3>Test Chips</h3>
So-called <i>test chips</i> are used to place single-piece converters (that
is, units with both a tuner and a descrambler) into full service. There
are a number of ways to accomplish this, but in some cases, the serial
number/market code for the unit is set to a known <i>universal</i> case
or, better yet, the comparison checks to determine which channels to
enable/disable are bypassed by replacing an IC in the unit. Hence, the
<i>descrambler</i> will always be active, no matter what. This latter type of
chip is superior because it cannot be disabled and is said to be <i>bullet
proof</i>, even if the cable company finds out about a <i>universal</i>
serial number. (When the cable company finds out about a universal serial
number, it is easy for them to disable the converter with a variation on
the <i>bullet</i> described below.)
<p>
<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3>Cubes</h3>
Another type of <i>test device</i> has been advertised in magazines such as
Electronics Now (formerly Radio-Electronics) and Nuts & Volts. It's
called a <i>cube</i> and it SIMULATES the addressing data signal for a cable
box, most commonly for those from Pioneer and Jerrold (the Zenith data
stream is sent in the VBI, making this apporach more difficult). You
plug the cable into one side, where it filters out the real data signal,
and out the other side comes a normal signal, but with a new data
stream. (There are also <i>wireless</i> cubes which you just periodically set
near your box with the cable disconnected to <i>refresh</i> it.)
<p>
This new data signal tells whatever boxes the cube addresses to go
into <i>full-service</i> mode (including any cable company-provided boxes).
Sometimes it is a non-destructive signal, and if the the <i>cube</i> is
removed from the line, the real data signal gets to the electronics
inside and the converter goes back to normal <i>non-test</i> mode. Note
that sometimes it IS destructive: there are some cubes that re-program
the electronic serial number in a converter to a new value. This type
has the advantage that it will work with any converter the cube was
designed to test (but changes the serial number to some <i>preset</i> value).
The <i>non-destructive</i> versions of a cube usually require that you
provide the serial number from the converter you're interested in
<i>testing</i>. That way a custom IC can be programmed to address that
converter with the necessary data. (Otherwise the converter would ignore
the information, since the serial number the cube was sending and the
one in converter wouldn't match.)
<p>
The best cubes that we have seen are the <i>Stealth FSK</i> and
<i>RFT-2</i> units.  These seem to offer the most trouble free performance,
don't require a serial number, and are non-destructive devices.
<p>
There are some newer cubes on the market called <i>genesis</i> FSKs that
will reboot (or reactivate) a shut down box.
<p>
<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3>Bullets</h3>
First and foremost, <b>THE <i>BULLET</i> IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE NORMAL
CABLE FSK DATA STREAM WITH THE APPROPRIATE <i>CODE</i> TO DISABLE A
CONVERTER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE CABLE COMPANY.</b>
For instance, the head
end could send a code to all converters which says <i>unless you've been
told otherwise in the last 12 hours, shut down.</i> All legitimate boxes
were individually sent a code to ignore this shut down code, but the
pirate decoders didn't get such a code because the cable company doesn't
have their serial number. So they shut down when the see the <i>bullet</i>
code.
<p>
The <i>bullet</i> is NOT a harmful high-voltage signal or something as
the cable companies would like you to believe -- if it was, it would
damage anyone with a cable-ready TV or VCR connected to the cable (not
something the cable company wants to deal with!)
<p>
The only way to get <i>caught</i> by such a signal is to contact the cable
company and tell them your illegal descrambler just quit working for
some reason. :-) Not a smart thing to do, but you'd be surprised,
especially if it's someone else in the house who calls, like a spouse,
child, babysitter, etc.  While we're on the subject, it's also not a
good idea to have cable service personnel come into your residence and
find an unauthorized decoder...
<p>
<hr size=5 noshade>
<h3>Time Domain Reflectometry / Leak Detection</h3>
The cable company can use a technique called <i>Time Domain Reflectometry</i>
(TDR) to try and determine how many devices are connected to your cable.
In simple terms, a tiny, short test signal is sent into your residence
and the time domain reflectometer determines the number of connections
by the various <i>echoes</i> returned down the cable (since each device
is at a different point along the cable, they can be counted.) Each
splitter, filter, etc. will affect this count. A simple way to avoid
being <i>probed</i> is to install an amplifier just inside your premises
before any connections. This isolates the other side of the cable from
the outside, and a TDR will only show one connection (the amplifier).
<p>
The cable company also has various ways of detecting signal <i>leaks</i>
in their cable. The FCC REQUIRES them to allow only so much signal to
be radiated from their cables. You may see a suspicious looking van
driving around your neighborhood with odd-looking antennas on the roof.
These are connected inside to field strength meters which help locate
where the leaks are coming from so they can be fixed (to prevent a
fine from the FCC!) If you've tampered with a connection at the pole
(say, to hook up a cable that had been disconnected) and didn't do a
good job, chances are the connection will "leak" and be easily found by
such a device. This can also happen INSIDE your residence if you use
cheap splitters/amplifiers or have poorly-shielded connections. The
cable company will ask to come inside, and bring with them a portable
field strength meter to help them locate the problem. Often they will
totally remove anything causing the leak, and may go further (e.g.,
legal action) if they feel you're in violation of your contract with
them (which you agree to by paying your bill.) Obviously it's a bad
idea to let cable service personnel into your house if you ARE doing
something you shouldn't (which you shouldn't be in the first place), but
if you DON'T let them in (as is your right), it will definitely arouse
suspicion. Eventually you will have to let them in to fix the "leak", or
they will disconnect your cable to stop the leak altogether. (After all,
it's a service, not a right, to receive cable!)
<p>

<h3>Some Common Ways Pirates Get Caught</h3>
There are many ways for a <i>pirate</i> to get caught. Since stealing cable
is illegal in the U.S., you can be fined and sent to jail for theft of
service. Cable companies claim to lose millions of dollars in revenue
every year because of pirates, so they are serious in their pursuit of
ridding them from their system.
<p>
<ul>
<li>A pirate will often show-off the fact they can get every channel
   to their friends. Pretty soon lots of people know about it, and then
   the cable company offers a "Turn In A Pirate And Get $50" program. A
   "friend" needs the money and turns the pirate in...
<p>
<li>A pirate (or more likely, unsuspecting housemate of a pirate who
   knows nothing about whats going on) calls the cable company to report a
   problem with the equipment or signal. The cable company makes a service
   call and finds gray-market equipment connected to the cable...
<p>
<li>During a pay-per-view event such as a fight, the cable company offers
   a free T-shirt to all viewers. Little does the pirate know that just
   before that message appeared on the screen, legitimate viewer's boxes
   were told to switch to another channel WHILE STILL DISPLAYING THE
   ORIGINAL CHANNEL NUMBER (yes, cable boxes can do this.) So now the
   legitimate subscriber continues to see the "original" signal (without
   the T-shirt offer), while the pirate gets an 800 number plastered on
   the screen. The pirate calls, and the cable company gets a list of all
   potential pirates...
<p>
<li>The cable company temporarily broadcasts some soft-core pornography
   onto what is supposed to be The Disney Channel (and vice-versa). They
   simultaneously reprogram subscriber converters to re-map the channels
   correctly, so the change is transparent to all but non-company 
   converters. Those who call to complain about the "non-Disney" 
   entertainment (or cartoons on the Playboy channel :-) are more than 
   likely to have gray-market decoders...
<p>
<li>A big cable descrambler business gets busted. The authorities
   confiscate their UPS shipping records and now have a list of
   "customers" who most likely ordered descramblers for illegitimate
   use...
<p>
</ul>
And this is only the beginning. Unconfirmed reports of the cable company
driving around with special equipment allowing them to determine what
you're watching on your TV (like HBO, which you don't pay for) have also
been mentioned (but unlikely.)
<p>
Of course, the best thing to do is simply PAY FOR WHAT YOU WATCH!  Then
you don't have to worry about the possibility of a prison term, criminal
record, hefty fine, etc.
<p>

<h3>The Universal Descrambler</h3>
In May of 1990, Radio-Electronics magazine published an article on
building a <i>universal descrambler</i> for decoding scrambled TV signals.
There has been much talk on the net about the device, and many have
found it to be lacking in a number of respects. Several modifications,
hoping to fix some of the problems have also been posted, with limited
success. The Universal Descrambler relies on the presence of the
colorburst for its reference signal. In a normal line of NTSC video,
the colorburst is 8 to 11 cycles of a 3.579545 MHz clock (that comes
out to 2.31 microseconds) which follows the 4.71 microsecond horizontal
sync during the horizontal blanking interval. <p>

Since a large
number of scrambling systems depend on messing with the horizontal sync
pulse to scramble the picture, the Universal Descrambler attempts to
use the colorburst signal to help it replace the tainted sync pulse.
Unfortunately, random video inversion is still a problem, as are color
shifts which occur from distorted or clamped colorburst signals, etc.
Most people have not had very good results from the system, even after
incorporating some modifications.

<h3>Glossary of Related Terms</h3>

<b>CATV:</b>   Acronym for Community Antenna TeleVision. Originally cable TV
        came about as a way to avoid having everyone in a community have
        to spend a lot of money on a fancy antenna just to get good TV
        reception.  Really all you need is one very good antenna and 
	then just feed the output to everyone.  It was called Community
        Antenna Television (CATV).  Of course, it has grown quite a bit
        since then and everyone now just calls it cable TV.  The old
        acronym still sort-of works.<p>
<b>Converter:</b>
	A device, sometimes issued by the cable company, to "convert"
	many TV channels to one specific channel (usually channel 3).  
	Used early-on when VHF & UHF channels were on different dials
	(and before remote controls) to provide "convenience" to cable
	customers.  Now mostly considered a nuisance, thanks to the
	advent of cable-ready video equipment, they are mainly used as
        descramblers.<p>
	An "addresable" converter is one that has a unique serial number
        and can be told (individually by FSK or other signal) by the
        head-end to act in a
	certain manner (such as enabling channel x, but not channel y). 
	Addressable converters nearly always contain descramblers for
	decoding premium services subscribed to by the customer. 
<p>
<b>Colorburst:</b>
	Approximately 8 to 10 cycles of a 3.579545 MHz clock sent during
	the HBI.  This signal is used as a reference to determine both 
	hue and saturation of the colors.  A separate colorburst signal 
	is sent for each line of video, and are all exactly in phase (to 
	prevent color shifts). 
<p>
<b>Control Signal:</b>
	The first 11.1 microseconds of a line of NTSC video.  The signal
	area from 0 to 0.3 volts (-40 to 0 IRE units) is reserved for
	control signals, the rest for picture information.  If the
	signal is at 0.3 volts (or 0 IRE) the picture will be black. 
	See IRE Units; Set-up Level. 
<p>

<b>Cube:</b> A test device that generates an FSK signal to the cable box to
activate itself into full service mode also called FSK device or FSK unit.
The first Cubes were named because of the cube shaped box that they were
sold in.
<p>

<b>Field:</b>  One half of a full video frame.  The first field contains
	the odd numbered lines, the second field contains the even
	numbered lines.  Each field takes 1/60th of a second to
	transmit.  Note that both fields contain a complete
	vertical-blanking interval and they both (should) have the same
	information during that interval.  Since the NTSC standard is
	525 lines, each field contains 262.5 lines--therefore it's the
	half-line that allows the two fields of a frame to be
	distinguished from one another.  See Frame; Line. 
<p>

<b>Frame:</b>  An NTSC video signal which contains both fields.  A frame
	lasts 1/30th of a second.  See Field; Line. 
<p>
<b>FSK:</b>  Acronym for Frequency Shif Keying.  A common data modulation
        method.  Addressable cable systems usually send there control
        information using this method.
<p>
<b>FSK Device:</b> See Cube.
<p>

<b>Head-end:</b>
	The main cable distribution facility where your CATV signal
	originates from.  (Easily identifed by several large satellite
	dishes, some smaller ones, and usually an antenna tower.)
<p>

<b>HBI:</b> Acronym for Horizontal Blanking Interval.  The first 11.1
	microseconds of a line of video.  It contains the front porch,
	the 4.71 microsecond horizontal sync pulse, the 2.31
	microseconds of colorburst, and the back porch.  The horizontal
	sync pulse directs the beam back to left side of the screen.
	Almost every scrambling method in use today mutataes this part
	of the signal in some way to prevent unauthorized viewing.  See
	Colorburst.
<p>
<b>Interlace:</b>
	Term used to describe the dual-field approach used in the NTSC
	standard.  By drawing every other line, screen flicker is
	increased--but if all the lines were painted sequentially, the 
        top would begin to fade before the screen was completely "painted". 
        (Computer monitors, which do "paint" from top to bottom, do not
        have the problem due to higher refresh rates.)
<p>
<b>IPPV:</b>   Impulse Pay-Per-View.  A method whereby a viewer can order a
	pay-per-view event "on impulse" by just pushing an "Order" (or
        similar) button on a remote control or cable converter keypad.
        A customer's purchases are sent back to the head-end via a
	standard telephone connection (the converter dials into the cable
	co. computer and uploads the data) or via radio frequency (RF) if 
	the cable supports two-way communication (most don't).  A pre-set
	maximum number of events can be ordered before the box requires 
	the data to be sent to the head-end for billing purposes.
<p>
<b>IRE Units:</b>
	IRE is an acronym for Institute of Radio Engineers.  The NTSC
	standard calls for a peak-to-peak signal voltage of 1 volt. 
	Instead of referring to the video level in volts, IRE units are
	used instead.  The IRE scale divides the 1- volt range into 140
	parts, with zero-IRE corresponding to about 0.3V.  The full
	scale goes from -40 IRE to +100 IRE.  This is convenient scale
	to make a distinction between control signals (< 0 IRE) and
	picture signals (> 0 IRE).  See Control Signal. 
<p>
<b>Line:</b>   A video signal is a series of repeated horizontal lines,
	consisting of control and picture information.  The color NTSC
	standard allows a total time of 63.56 microseconds for each
	line, and each frame is composed of 525 lines of video
	information.  The first 11.1 microseconds make up the horizontal
	blanking interval, or control signal, the following 52.46 
	microseconds make up the picture signal.  See HBI; VBI.
<p>
<b>NTSC:</b> Acronym for National Television Standards Committee (or
	Never The Same Color, if you prefer :-) 
<p>
<b>Picture Signal:</b>
	The 52.46 microseconds of signal following the control signal. 
	Information in this area is between 0 and 100 IRE units.  See
	IRE Units. 
<p>
<b>PPV:</b> Acronym for Pay-Per-View.  A revenue-enhancing system where
	customer's pay to watch a movie or event on a "per view" basis.
	Cusomers usually place a phone call to a special number and order
	the event of their choice; some systems provide Impulse PPV.
	The presence of a PPV movie channel or your system guarantees
	you have addressable converters.  See IPPV.
<p>
<b>Set-up Level:</b>
	Picture information technically has slightly less than 100 IRE
	units available.  That's because picture information starts at
	7.5 IRE units rather than at 0 IRE units.  The area from 0 to
	7.5 IRE units are reserved for what is commonly called the
	"set-up level".  Having a small buffer area between the control
	signal information and the picture information is a "fudge
	factor" to compensate for the fact that real-life things that
	don't always work as nicely as they do on paper. :-)  See IRE
	Units. 
<p>
<b>VBI: </b>Acronym for Vertical-Blanking Interval.  The first 26 lines of
	an NTSC video signal.  This signal is used to direct the beam
	back to the upper-left corner of the screen to start the next
	frame.  In order for the horizontal sync to continue operating,
	the vertical pulse is serrated into small segments which keep
	the horizontal circuits active.  Both actions can then take
	place simultaneously.  The VBI is the most common place for 
	"extra" information to be sent, such as various test signals, 
	and in some cable systems, a data stream.

<h3>Television Frequency Chart</h3>

The following chart lists frequency information for the "standard"
carrier sets. In an HRC (Harmonically Related Carrier) system, all
picture carrier frequencies are derived from a 6 MHz oscillator, so
all channels except 5 and 6 will be 1.25 MHz lower than usual. Channels
5 and 6 will be 0.75 MHz HIGHER than usual. An IRC (Incrementally
Related Carrier) system, all channels are at their normal frequency
except for channels 5 and 6, which will be 2 MHz higher than usual.
<p>

Some older TV sets can't receive any channels except 5 and 6 on an
HRC system, and can't receive channels 5 and 6 on an IRC system. This
is also true of some cable converters. A few converters are set up
to allow HRC or IRC operation but with channels 5 and 6 on different
numbers -- 55 and 56, or 55 and 66. (Tnx to David Sharpe and Ed Ellers
for this info!)
