<h2>Removing Cable Security Sleeves</h2>

This file is for those wondering how to remove those annoying
spinning cylinders from the cable hook ups.
<p>
I wanted to get thouse cylinders off so I thought check the hacker
and cable groups for info. The advice was get a removal tool. No one 
could agree on the name of the cylinders. How can you buy the tool if 
you don't know what to call it. Walk in to the electronics store and say
"hi I want the tool that removes the spinning thing from the outside 
cable hook up, so i can pirate cable."  I don't think so. I did research
by going to electronics stores and looking at cable supply catalogs.
<p>
<h4>Terminology:</h4>
<p>
<i>Terminator caps:</i>
They look like little caps with a rounded 1/4 inch spike
in the center on the outside. They screw onto the male ends. I was 
told that they are used to end the line to stop line problems that 
cause double images, ghosts, warping, etc.
<p>
<i>Barrel connectors:</i>
These are simply to male ends used for connecting two cables together.
<p>
<i>Security Sleeves:</i> (this is what they were called in the catalog)
They look like 1 inch cylinders with a male end. They spin in both
directions so that you cant take them off.
<p>
I was going to buy a removal tool but they cost 20 bucks and it takes
two weeks for the order to arrive. There were three kinds of tools and 
the picture of the security sleeve was different than mine. I aboandoned
that plan
<p>
If you look in the end of the sleeve with a flashlight you will figure out
how they work. Look on the inside wall, and you will see little rectangular
notches in the inner part that is stationary. The tool would fit into these
and simply unscrew it.
<p>
<h4>Methods of removal:</h4>
I have thought of several methods some are destructive some are not.
<p>
1. buy the tool -to expensive -which kind?
<p>
2. drill through it sideways -to noisy
<p>
3. hack saw -noisy
<p>
4. reverse threaded bolt in the end, such as from a tap and die set
-what size?
<p>
5. Locking pliers, crush the sides and twist -possible damage
<p>
6. eraser with small diameter in the end -might work, tightness?
<p>
7. caulking with a small stick in the end -tightness?
<p>
8. paper clip -tightness?
<p>
9. snap ring pliers -about $7 -I used these- You can buy them at auto 
parts stores. Make sure you get a pair with removable tips, and that they 
come with tips that are bent at a 45 degre angle. Just stick one tip in 
the notch on the inside wall and twist.
<p>
Enjoy your cable.
