<h2>How to Build A Cube</h2>
<h4>4x of Group42</h4>
</center>
A cube is a Frequency Shift Keying transmitter that emulates a cable
head end with phony data that will turn on a cable box for full service.
<p>
In the early days of cubes, they were either single frequncy xtal controled
or tunable VHF VFO's.  The problem with the tunable VFO's was that they
were not that stable and required constant retuning.  The problem
with the old single frequncy cubes is that you had to know the customers
frequncy (for Jerrold or SA) before shipping, and that you had to build
different cubes for different frequencies.
<p>
We at Group 42 solved the problem by designing a better cube.  It is
a harmonic generator that will hit all Jerrold frequncies, and can
be easly adapted to SA and Pioneer Units.  To date it has been widely
copied in the grey market cable industry, making it the most popular
FSK design.
<p>
The <a href="cube.gif">schematic</a> is here.
<P>
R5 is not necessary unless you are leving the unit hooked up full time.
D3 is a 1n914 diode.
<p>
It operates by taking the <i>Manchester Encoded</i> digital signal from
the microcontroler and feeding it into the xtal oscillator driving the
HC4060 chip.  The voltage from the microcontroler is droped by D3 to .7
volts creating either a zero or .7 volt image accross D2 the variable
cap diode.  This changes the capacitance in the xtal oscillator driving
the HC4060, thus pulling the frequency of the xtal.  This creates a
frequency shift, thus FSK.
<p>
The xtal oscillator is divided down to a 500khz (using an 8Mhz xtal)
square wave that is feed out an F-Connector and into a cable box.
Since the output is a nice square wave we get lots of harmonics, every
500khz up to 200MHz and beyond.  This means a signal is present
on all 3 Jerrold frequencies (97.5, 106.5 and 108.5 Mhz).
<p>
It can be adapted to other frequncies by making sure that the divided
down value (ie 500khz) is dividable by the desired frequencie.
