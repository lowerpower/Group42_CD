<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<h4>Older Models</h4>
<ul>
Older models, 36 channel, 3x12 switch matrix versions, have a resistor
matrix consisting of 36 680ohm resistors.  Removing the resistor
appropriate to the channel desired, or punching out the hole in the track
leading to the resistor decodes the channel.
</ul>
<h4>Newer Models</h4>
<ul>
Nower models have an addressing module accessable from the bottom.  Shorting
pin 1 of IC3 (a 4081) to ground through an external spst switch does
the trick.  Any potting compound can be scraped away with the help of
a heat gun.
