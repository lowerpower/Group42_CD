<h2>Jerrold 450 Non-Trimode Full Service Modification</h2>
by 4x of Group 42

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This information is good for Jerrold non-trimode 450 series boxes.  An
external circuit using a 4081 or simalar <b>AND</b> gate, a 2n3906
transitor, two 10K resistors, a 100 ohm resistor, and a SPST switch.
<p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Logic <b>AND</b> pin 6 of the 4096 and pin 10 of the 4011 using
        a 4081 or simalar gate.
<li>Connect output of <b>AND</b> gate through a 10K resistor to the base of
        a 2n3906 Transistor.
<li>Connect Emitter of 2n3906 to -5 volts (wire post 5) through a 100 ohm
        resistor.
<li>Connect collector to -16 volts (wire post 3) through a 10K resistor.
<li>Cut the white wire going from wire post #10 to the metal can area at
        the metal can area.
<li>Connect the white wire to the collector of the 2n3906 transistor
        through the SPST switch.
<li>It might also be neccessary to short together wire posts 1 and 2
        to defeat the addressability function.
</ul>
