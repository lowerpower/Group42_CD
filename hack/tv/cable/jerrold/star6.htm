<h2>Starcom 6 Full Service Modification</h2>
by 4x of Group 42
<p>
</center>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This information is good for the following Starcom 6 units :<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Trimode Units</b> - DP5-210,310,410. DP5-212,312,412. DPV5-212,322,422.
        DPV5-210,310,410.
<li><b>Baseband Units</b> - DPBB-222,322,422. DPBB-212,312,412.
</ul>
<p>
This fix is designed to permanently turn on either a working unit or one
that has been shut down.  Once the modification has been installed
correctly, all channels will be received in the clear.
<p>
Several models of the Starcom 6 exist, and the same model number can
even have differnet board layouts.  Make sure you are working on
a Starcom 6 and not a Starcom 5 or a Starcom 7 since some cable companies
are using a combination of these.  Two distinct version of the Starcom
6 are avalable (Baseband and Trimode) and are not compatable with each
other.  The most common type is the Trimode gated sync descrambler
designated as DP5 or DPV5.  The other type is the baseband descrambler
designated as DPBB.  The first number following the dash indicates its
original channel output (i.e. DPV5-312 is a channel 3 output unit).
Some Trimode units have volume control which is designated by a 'V' in
the model number.  All baseband units have volume control.
<p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>To open the unit you must remove the GI star screws.  Either obtain
        a custom star driver bit or use a small pair of flush cutters
        placing the two blades into oppsite notches and turning.
<li>Place lid upside down to the front or the right side.
<li>Locate the tamper switch by one of the cover screws or by the
        display.  Hold the metal part of the switch down and us
        a soldering iron to melt the plastic underneath to hold it
        closed.
<li>Program a 2764 EPROM or a 27C64 EPROM with this <a href="jerld550.bin"
        >binary</a> or <a href="jerld550.hex">Intel Hex</a> file.
<li>Remove the 28 pin chip in a socket, it will normally be marked 2764 on
        the chip.  Remove this chip an make sure to note the position of
        pin #1.
<li>Insert the newly programed 2764 in this empty socket.
<li>Next locate a 40 pin chip marked <b>PIC 7040</b>.  It will normally
        be marked IC6 or U4 on the circuit board.  Cut pin # 36 in the
        center (so it can be soldered back if you desire.)
<li>Attach or solder a wire to the chip side of this pin and connect it to
        Ground.
<li>Replace cover and power up.
</ul>
<i>Notes : unit may display <b>E9</b> on first powerup, this is normal
and will go away when you push a channel button.
<p>
Some units may reset the channel output.  Try your TC on channels number
2, 3 and 4.  If this does not work check the green wire towards the rear
of unit.  it should have +5v on it, if not apply +5 volts and video
will return.
