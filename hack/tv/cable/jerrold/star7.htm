<h2>Starcom 7 R1 Full Service Modification</h2>
by 4x of Group 42
<p>
</center>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This information is good for the following Starcom 7 revision 1 units :<p>
<p>
This fix is designed to permanently turn on either a working unit or one
that has been shut down.  Once the modification has been installed
correctly, all channels will be received in the clear.
<p>
Several models of the Starcom 7 exist, and the same model number can
even have differnet board layouts.  This fix only works on R1 units.
R2 and CFT units need an R2/V5 fix.
<p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make a circuit board as shown for the testboard.

<li>Burn a GAL22V10 or PAL22V10 With one of the following:
        <a href="sc7newmp.bin">fix1</a>,
        <a href="sc7oldmp.bin">fix2</a>,
        <a href="sc7origl.bin">fix3</a>, or
        <a href="star7.jed">fix4</a> and install in testboard.

<li>To open the unit you must remove the GI star screws.  Either obtain
        a custom star driver bit or use a small pair of flush cutters
        placing the two blades into oppsite notches and turning.
        Hinge the top cover to the frount, upside down, and out of the
        way.
<li>Locate the EPROM (U4) in the unit and solder a 28pin socket over
        the EPROM.
<li>Some units have a talkback module that needs to be removed.  It is
        a long module with 2F fittings.  Simply disconnect the molex
        connectors and screws and remove.
<li>On some trimode units, cut W25.  On baseband units, make sure W25 is
        not cut.
<li>Locate the IC labeled 74HC138 <a href="star71.gif">(see diagram.)</a>.
        On trimode units you may have to lift the tuner slightly.  Solder
        a wire from pin 15 to test board pad where marked.
<li>Locate LC3518 (U5) and cut pin 20 in a manner that you can solder to
        the IC side of the pin.  Solder the wire from the test board to
        pin 20 of the LC3518 (U5).
<li>Insert the test board in in the socket on top of U4.
<li>Put the unit back together.  It takes a few seconds befor the unit
        will turn on.
</ul>
