<h2>TC-35B (Oak Vari-synch) Turn On</h2>
by 4x of Group 42, Dec 1984

<h3>Instructions</h3>
One method of activation the TC-35B decoder consists of tapping into the
potted blue-epoxy module located inside the box.  Pirates usually use an
overlay to get the hole positions right.
<p>
The basic procedure is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cut out the xtal by severing one lead (disables clock).
<li>Gnd pin 27 of the 28-pin (6805) uP (enables video.)
<li>Gnd pin 26 of the same chip (enables decoder.)
</ul>
With the large electrolytic capacitor on the left of the board (think as
9:00), the crystal is located at 1:00, and the pin numbering of the uP
(28-pin) is with pin 1 in the upper right-hand corner.  This chip is
bisible externally as an outline in the epoxy overcoat, and is located
just below the crystal but above the electrolytic capacitor.
<p>
This information is provided so that a repair technician can recognize
the problem and return the unit to normal (addressable) operation, or
in an emergenc situation to activate a box :')  It is not intended
that this procedure be used for unauthorized viewing...
