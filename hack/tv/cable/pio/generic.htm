<h2>Pioneer Generic Test Chip for Pre-6300 Units</h2>
by G-Man of Group 42<p>
</center>
This test chip can be used as an internal test chip or as an external
cube for all pre-6300 pioneer units.  It will turn on the Pioneer
unit for full service testing.
<p>
The test chip <a href="generic.bin">code</a> is programmed onto a
PIC16c54 micro processor and
either hooked up internally or run into a Voltage Controled Oscillator
running at 110Mhz to produce a FSK signal to be run into the input
of the Pioneer unit.
