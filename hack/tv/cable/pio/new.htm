<h2>Pioneer Custom Test Chip for Post-6300 Units</h2>
by G-Man of Group 42<p>
</center>
This test chip can be used as an internal test chip or as an external
cube for all post-6300 Pioneer units.  It will turn on the Pioneer
unit for full service testing.
<p>
The <a href="pioneer.exe">Pioneer custom program</a> is run and the
serial number of the box you wish to test is entered.  The program
will then generate a program that can be programmed onto a PIC16c56
micro processor and either hooked up internally or run into a Voltage
Controled Oscillator
running at 110Mhz to produce a FSK signal to be run into the input
of the Pioneer unit.
