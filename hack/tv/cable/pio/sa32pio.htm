<h2>SA-3 To Pioneer Conversion Instructions</h2>
by G-Man of Group 42<p>
</center>

There are many SA-3 descrambler pans out there and you should be able
to pick up used pans for $10-$15.  These are easly converted into
descramblers that will work on many Pioneer systems.  The basic
concept of the modification is to change the sync restoration
to the appropriate levels of a Pioneer system.
<p>
There are two versions of this mod, it will be apparent which one you
will need to use when you open up your SA-3 pan for the modification.
<p>
<h3>Modification Version #1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a .027ufd cap from pins 6 and 7 of IC6 (555 timer) to jumper
        K11.
<li>Connect a 10pf cap accress R40 (33K).
<li>Add a SPST switch as shown in diagram.  Switch can be mounted inside
        of case.

<li>Change R45 to 240 ohms.
<li>Change R46 to 510 ohms.
<li>Add a 10ufd cap from pin 15 of IC7 (TDA4040) to jumper K15. + goes
        to K15, - goes towards IC7.
<li>Add a 10K resistor in series with R27 (15K).
<li>Change R32 to 240 ohms.
<li>Cut one leg of C11 loose.
<li>Cut one side loose of R1 (270 ohms.)
<li>Cut one side loose of R3 (270 ohms.)
<li>Use heat sinks on IC7 and IC8.
<li>Cut loose one side of R5 and add a 240 ohm in series with it.  Attach
        a SPST switch with center off as shown.  Mount switch on back of
        case.

</ul>
<h3>Modification Version #2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Change R32 to 240 ohms.
<li>Add a 10K resistor in series with R27 (15k).
<li>Replace Jumper K15 with a diode with the cathode (band) twards C33.
<li>Replace Jumper K21 with a diode with cathode towards IC8.
<li>Add a 220ufd cap from K14 to ground, obviously the + side of the cap
        goes to K14.
<li>Cut one side loose of C11.
<li>Change R45 to 240 ohms.
<li>Change R46 to 680 ohms.
<li>Put heat sinks on IC7 and IC8.
<li>Follow steps to install the two switches as in Modification Version #1
        (also as shown in diagrams.)
</ul>
