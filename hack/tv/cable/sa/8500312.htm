The following procedure will allow the 8500-312 converter/descrambler
to receive all scrambled and non-scrambled channels, even
if it is shut down by the cable company.  It is a very simalar
<i>fix</i> to the 8500-321 modification.
<p>
<h4>Procedure</h4>
Locate the main processor IC on the main P.C. board with the part number
<b>MN1414ETG</b> on it.  This is IC305 on the circuit board.  Now locate
jumber W310 just below the IC.  Cut this jumper and install a .01uf
disk capacitor across the now open jumper.  On the lead of the capacitor
closest to the IC, solder a 22K resistor from this lead and connect the
other end of the resistor to pin 21 on IC305.  The descrambler should
now properly receive and descramble all channels.
<p>
See the 8500-321 modification for trouble shooting information.
