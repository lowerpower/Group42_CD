<h2>SA8580 Test Chip Code, 6 and 7 Button Versions</h2>
by G-Man of Group 42

If you have a 8580 7 button unit, program a MC68HC705C8P with this
<a href="8580plus.bin">code</a>
(also in intel <a href="8580plus.hex">format</a>.)
Remove original 40 pin processor and replace with your newly programmed
processor.  Your lock out code is <i>24124</i>.
<p>
If you have an 8580 6 button, find the chip with a Green or Red strip
on it.  This is a serial EEprom, a 93c46.  Reprogram it with either the
<a href="85806red.bin">Red</a> or <a href="85806grn.bin">Green</a> code
and replace in unit.
<p>
It is possible to write some pic code to program the 93c46 serial
EEprom with the above .bin files and use this as a test chip.
Infact that is how most <i>quick boards</i> work today.
