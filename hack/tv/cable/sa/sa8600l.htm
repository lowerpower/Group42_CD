<h2>SA8600 Longbord Test Chip</h2>

The SA8600 Longboard was the first stable 8600 fix we did.  The board
layouts are <a href="lbfix2.gif">here</a> and the schematic is <a
href="lbfix1.gif">here.</a>  But first you must burn a PIC16C56 with
this <a href="8600lb.obj">code</a>.
<p>
Snap the unit in and and power up the box.  You should now be able to
change the channels on the converter box from 1 to 99.  However most
units will take up to 48 hours for the converter to receive system data
that will align the channels to the correct channel number.  The box
must be plugged in and have the input cable connected in order to
receive system data.
<p>
If the converter stops working properly, unplug the AC cord, wait 15 seconds
and plug back in.
