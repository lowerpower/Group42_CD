First off, did you mean SA8590, not 5890? Assuming so, the 8590 can
theoretically be zapped one of 3 ways:

   a. An intelligent "cube" to simulate VBI command data.
   b. Replacing the micro-processor.
   c. Adding a "test kit" the writes over the serial EEPROM's, loading
      data that activates the box.

It is my opinion that it is not possible to do option A on this
particular model. Sending command data on top of real video coming in
from the cable company sounds very difficult and expensive; I doubt
anyone is doing it with any practical marketablity.

As for the Zenith box, your talking apples and oranges. It's not
logical that just because one brand can be done a certain way that
"any" brand can also be done. The device your "friend" showed you
sounds like a standard replacement PROM (some companies use PAL's
though), that is hardwired into the CPU of the ST-1000 and ST-1600
boxes. If I'm correct, it is NOT external to be box but seriously wired
internal. (Typically, it is a replacement PROM for an epoxyed covered
unit, and is connected with 3 additional wires.) You did'nt describe
enough hardware to account for a device that has a power supply,
generates a digital data stream, syncronizes it to the incoming video,
and merges it to the picture info (with an RF modulator to boot!).

A quick example on how "zapping" can vary model to model, never mind
brand to brand.

- A Scientific Atlanta 8550 and be zapped (once activated) with simply
ONE diode.

- A Scientific Atlanta 8580 CANNOT be zapped with a diode, but CAN be
zapped with an inexpensive FSK generator.

- A Scientific Atlanta 8570 CANNOT be zapped with a diode OR an FSK
generator, but can only be zapped by an serial EEPROM writer or
replacement CPU.

Be careful who you listen to. Not everyone is an expert...
