<h2>Simple Tocom 5504a compatable descramlber</h2>
by G-Man of Group 42

<h4>Introduction</h4>
The Tocom 5504a uses a very simple method of scrambling the video
of the picture, it simply inverts the picture levels.  Hardly
scrambling at all, but is effective since most people don't want
to watch an inverted signal.  This circuit can also be used on
the output of so called universal descramblers to correct an
inverted output.
<p>
The simple descrambler simply uses an LF357 opamp to invert a baseband
signal back to normal.  The base band signal is supplied by a VCR or
other tuner and modulated back to channel 3 or 4 using an inexpensive
computer modulator.
