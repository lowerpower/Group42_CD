<h2>Tocom 5504a 55 Plus Fix</h2>
by G-Man of Group 42
</center>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
The Tocom 5504a 55 plus unit can very simply be modified into full service
mode by installing a DPST switch, a SPST switch, a 20K ohm resistor,
a 100K ohm resistor, a .01uh cap and optionally a 10K variable resistor.
<p>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Install lead from U16 pin 9 to a SPST switch, other lead to ground.
This is the scamble/normal video switch.  Open is scrambled, closed
is Normal Video.
<li>Run a lead from U10 Pin 6 to a 20K resistor and then to pin 4 of J2
which is a source of 12 VDC.  This will enable the audio section.
<li>Ground Pins 9 and 10 on U16 to enable the video.
<li>Cut the printed circuit at point x (see diagram) and solder a lead and
a .01 cap to ground at this point.  The lead goes to the center wiper of
the 10K tuning pot, the other 2 ends of the tuning pot go to ground and
+25 VDC.  See diagram for location of the +25 VDC.
</ul>
<p>
If the lower board is used, Pin 16 and 17 must be removed on J3 to
enable the scramble/normal switch.
<p>
Different combinations of the A/B switch will probide full coverage of
the cable channels 2-6, 7-13, 14-36 and so on.
<p>
You can also use the Tocom as a channel 3 unscrambler with a channel 3
output converter ahead of the Tocom.  This allowes you to hard wire
the switches into a working configuration and not have to mess with
switching them for different channels.  Alternativly you can build
a simple <a href="toc5504a.htm">descrambler</a> that will replace this
box compleatly.
<p>
Also if you are using surplus main boards and power supplies, make
up a power coard to go between the power supply and J1 of the
main board as per <a href="tocom55p.gif">diagram.</a>
