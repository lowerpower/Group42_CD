<h2>Zenith Hand Remote Turn On</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
On some models of the Z-TAC unit, the following procedure will have to be
done in order to use the hand remote.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Slice a jumper wire into the purple wire that comes from the infrared
        receiver.
<li>Open the shielded area of the tuning board and attach jumper wire to
        Pin 11 of the processor chip that is inside.
<li>This pin number could varry depending on the particular chip that is
        being used.
<li>If need be, you can touch the wire from pin to pin until you find the
        right one.
<li>You don' have to worry about damaging anything, if you touch the wrong
        pin.  Some pins may shut the unit off.  All you do is turn the unit
        back on again.
<li>For some Z-TAC ST-1000 type boxes when IR remote will not work, there
        is a white wire rinning to J11 on the decoder board, unplug this
        wire and leave it loose.  This will usually restore proper IR remote
        operation.
</ul>
