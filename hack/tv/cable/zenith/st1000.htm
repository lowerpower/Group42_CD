the case with 1/4" screws.  It is a long narrow board with a battery on it.
It is identified on the component side by the numbers 204-1106-0314 and
9-132-04.  The foil side has the followin number on it 204-1106-03M.

At this point the box is open for video.  You may need to adjust the AGC,
the pot is located in the bottom center portion of the cabinet in a
tin enclosure.  The adjustment hole is at the right center of the module.
<p>
If you hear barker audio rather than the normal programming, one of the
pots near the ACG will need to be adjusted.
