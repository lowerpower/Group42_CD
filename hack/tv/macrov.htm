This article has been built upon my original &quot;Macrovision explained&quot; - one
that was posted to <b>rec.video</b> some time ago. Completely new in this version
is a &quot;reader-friendly front-end&quot;, i.e. an explanation for general audiences
without technical background. Also some minor modifications have been done
to the technical section.<p>

Some material has been acquired from the Net and some (most) from my own
experiments.<p>

New contributions <b>and</b> new questions are most welcome.  Grammar
corrections are accepted, because I am not a native speaker of English.<p>

Information presented here should be correct as far as <b>I</b> know, but utter
rubbish may have crept in, so proceed carefully.<p>

<a name="MACROVISION_003"><h1> 3) What is this? </h1></a>

<ol>
<li> What is Macrovision?

Macrovision is a videotape copy protection method for VHS video cassette
recorders. It is used on pre-recorded videotapes, and it seems to be more
common in North America than in Europe. If you want a tape that will have
Macrovision, get a Disney one.<p>

(Someone else might know who invented, marketed and/or used it, etc.)<p>

<li>What does it look like?

When dubbing a protected tape, the picture that has gone through the
recording VCR will get dark and then normal again periodically. The picture
may also become unstable when it is at its darkest.<p>

Some televisions do not like Macrovision either; the top of the picture
might be unstable all the time and the colors may flicker.<p>

If you have a TV that has an adjustment for picture height or vertical
hold, you can play with those. Macrovision signals can be seen as very
bright and very dark regions (stripes) near the top of the picture.<p>


<li>Is there an easy and economical way to get rid of it?

Not really. There are three main alternatives:<p>

<ul>
<li>Modify the VCR. It is easy in principle, just change the value of one
  capacitor or resistor in the destination deck. The problem is, you'd
  probably have to get a service manual to find out which one. Furthermore,
  you still don't get rid of the protection; it just makes the copying
  possible.

<li>Make an eliminator yourself. It is a relatively straightforward task
  (more in the technical section), _if_ you know electronics. Most
  people don't, unfortunately.

<li>Buy a commercial &quot;stabilizer&quot;. This method is definitely easy, but not
  the cheapest.
</ul>
</ol>

<hr>

<a name="MACROVISION_004"><h1> 4) A non-technical explanation </h1></a>

Here is a simple explanation of how the method works. It exploits the
automatic gain control (AGC) circuit in the recorder. The purpose of the
AGC is to adjust the level of the video signal in such a way that the
recording capabilities of the tape are fully used. This means that weak
signals are amplified and strong ones are attenuated.<p>

In the Macrovision method, some new signals are inserted in the non-visible
portion of the picture. These signals can make the VCR think that a
perfectly normal picture is suddenly way, way too bright. The AGC circuit
therefore darkens it until it thinks the brightness is normal. Of course,
now the _real_ picture is very dark. The picture is varied between bright
and dark periodically in order to defeat simple eliminators that would just
amplify the dark and murky signal back to almost normal.<p>

Why isn't the TV affected? Well, most TV sets do not have any AGC-circuits
at all, and the rest behave differently from VHS ones.<p>

<ol>
<li>My friend has a VHS VCR that is not affected. How is this possible?<p>

The proper behavior of the AGC-circuit is very important in order to
achieve good protection. Apparently the specifications were somewhat&quot;loose&quot; in the pre-Macrovision days, so the old (how old?) machines are not
affected.<p>

JVC, the VHS license holder, has tightened the spec and the control, so it
is difficult to get an &quot;immune&quot; VCR, but there are some machines that are
conveniently &quot;out of spec&quot;. No, I don't know which ones.<p>

<li>I have heard that 8mm video is not affected by it. Is this true?

8mm video is not affected by Macrovision, because it is totally separate
from VHS. There is no need to have AGC circuits that bear any resemblance
to JVC ones.<p>

Of course, 8mm recorders do not remove the protection, so any subsequent
VHS dub will again be unwatchable.<p>


<li>Can Macrovision be defeated by copying via the aerial inputs/outputs?

No, it can't. There was some ancient method that could be eliminated
like that, but it is now long dead. Macrovision is so integrated in the
video signal that these simple tricks will not work.<p>


<li>There are many mail-order companies in the USA selling those boxes.
   Can I buy one and use it in Europe?

No, not really. You might get some improvement, but the protection
timings are sufficiently different to keep it from working properly.<p>


<li>My TV does not get a stable picture, when I watch rental tapes. Could
   this be a fault of the copy protection?

Yes, very likely. Macrovision signals resemble false synchronization
pulses, and some sets mistake them for the real ones.<p>


<li>Can laserdiscs have Macrovision?

Apparently no. First of all, it is technically difficult, because the region
used by Macrovision is also used to hold control data for the laserdisc
players. Secondly, as long as the laserdisc market stays as a niche market,
the distributors will not pressure the manufacturers to change the specs.<p>
</ol>

<a name="MACROVISION_005"><h1> 5) A technical explanation </h1></a>


In this part, I represent the empirical data about &quot;Macrovision in
action&quot; that I have gathered with my trusty 20+ year old oscilloscope.<p>

The main topics are:<p>

<ul>
<li>current PAL Macrovision
<li>old NTSC Macrovision
</ul>

<hr>
<b>REQUEST</b>: If anyone can analyze the rumored new NTSC Macrovision
and send the data to me, I'd be very grateful. It's pretty hard to get
NTSC tapes here.
<hr>

Tapes that I used were Disney's Beauty and the Beast (PAL) and 101
Dalmatians (NTSC).<p>

NB: From here, it gets very technical. A basic knowledge of what video
signal looks like is required.<p>

First, some basics. A television picture consists of 25/30 (PAL/NTSC)
_frames_. Every frame contains a total of 625/525 _lines_ (not all are
visible, though). Frames are _interlaced_, i.e. they are divided into
two _fields_ that are drawn on top of another in such a way that the
first field scans every alternate line and the second field 'fills in'
the missing lines. The scanning is from top to bottom and from left to
right.<p>

The fields are separated by _vertical synchronization_ pulses. The lines
are separated by _horizontal synchronization_ pulses. Both PAL and NTSC
standards specify that those approximately 20 lines that follow a
vertical sync are not to be used in forming the picture. These lines are
not visible in properly adjusted TVs, so they can e.g. carry TeleText
data, or, in our case, Macrovision copy protection signals (see pictures
1 and 2). The vertical sync and invisible lines form the _vertical
blanking region_.<p>

<hr>

<a name="MACROVISION_006"><h1> 6) Macrovision </h1></a>

So, what is the trick with Macrovision? In order to understand that,
some knowledge of VHS AGC circuits is needed (AGC==Automatic Gain
Control). The AGC circuits adjust the amplitude of the video (luminance)
signal by measuring the voltage difference between the bottom of the
horizontal sync and the back (rear) porch (see picture 3). Chrominance
AGC is measured from the color burst.<p>

What Macrovision does is to introduce false synchronization pulses
followed by false back porches at a very high voltage level (~15% over
white level).  The VHS VCR looks at the signal and thinks that it is fed
with an extremely high-amplitude signal and adjusts the gain control to
minimum --> the real picture gets very dim (see pictures 4 and 5).<p>

The AGC response must be like this:<p>

<ul>
<li>React _fast_ (in a few lines time) to an apparent increase in
  amplitude by attenuating the signal.

<li>React _slowly_ (in a few frames time) to an apparent decrease in
  amplitude by amplifying the signal.
</ul>


In the following pictures '|' represents a vertical synchronization
pulse.  Because of interlacing, the sync pulses of corresponding lines
in different fields are spaced 1/2 lines apart. The fields are drawn on
top of another because 1) my 'scope shows them like this, and 2) the
fields are nearly identical anyway.<p>

The scale of the video signal pictures:<p>
<ul>
<li>sync bottoms are 2 characters below black level
<li>white level is 5 characters above black level
<li>Macrovision signal peaks are 6 characters above black level
  (a reasonably good approximation)
</ul>

I'll explain those regions later. It is very easy to calculate the
required timing for a Macrovision eliminator from this picture (more
later, also).  There are other line numbering systems, but this is &quot;time

As can be observed, NTSC timing is a little bit tighter. I'm not sure
about the line numbering, because I have no NTSC-references, so please
correct me.<p>

Now, what do those lines inside Macrovision regions contain? Back to
basics, once again.<p>

The lines drawn above are quite similar. Both try to present false
synchronization pulses to the VCR the first 40 microseconds or so. The
rest of the line is black, because false syncs there would trigger the
sync circuits in monitors/TVs and consequently the top of the picture
would be very unstable. Some TVs really do suffer even now, I have seen
it myself.<p>


But that is not all. If the pulses had a constant amplitude, it would be
quite easy just to increase the amplitude of the video signal and get a
decent picture. Therefore the false back porch voltage level is varied
according to some simple rules in order to get the brightness changes as
annoying as possible.<p>

The following pictures show, how the false back porch amplitudes change
with time. The lowest level is black, the highest is &quot;super-white&quot;. The
false syncs (below black level) do not change their amplitude. The
perceived brightness of the TV picture is the inverse, e.g. the highest
level in the diagram means the darkest picture on the screen.<p>

As can be seen, old NTSC-Macrovision cycle is very simple. Please, once
again, send me information about the new one.<p>

All the slopes and the stable regions between them are timed in seconds,
because a) the timing is not so critical and b) it is difficult to say
in which frame a slope starts or ends.<p>

<h1>DISCLAIMER:</h1>
<b>I have built an eliminator and have used it for backing up my own precious 
videotapes. Try, for example, get a replacement for your damaged &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; videotape. You're lucky, if you succeed. I almost never 
rent videotapes; the picture sucks and they are usually &quot;pan-and-scan&quot; 
transfers. And the last reason: I'm a hardware hacker, so I did it just 
for the heck of it.</b><p>

Macrovision elimination is _very_ simple, if you have some knowledge of
electronics. My primary inspiration was: <p>

<pre>&quot;Macrovision decoder/blanker&quot;
Elektor Electronics, October 1988, pp. 44-47.
</pre>

(Note: it features an older version of Macrovision; not that different,
though.)<p>

I built roughly an equivalent circuit myself, but it was highly
unsatisfactory. Reasons:<p>

<ol>
<li> The circuit assumes that the incoming video signal has a certain
amplitude ==&gt; it uses fixed voltages and signal levels, which do not
work properly (because of varying input level and inaccurate clamping).

<li>Too many cheap electronic switches along the signal path ==&gt; visibly
worse picture quality (soft, color fluctuations).

<li>Chops off color burst from protected lines ==&gt; horrible color purity
errors near the top edge of the picture (perhaps the most visible error).
</ol>

Below is a block diagram of my currently satisfactorily working device.
It resembles only remotely the EE one. The basic idea is that the
Macrovision pulses are replaced with a black level. I challenge anyone
to make a simpler device.<p>

</pre>

Some explanations:<p>

<ul>
<li>Sync separator is the small and cheap LM1881. Only vertical sync and
  burst gate are used. I mention the explicit type here, because the
  device is practically built around it and because it replaces a whole
  chunk of analog electronics.

<li>The sample and hold circuit is used to sample the black level. Although
  the sampling occurs at color burst time, I have not experienced any
  difficulties. 2 op amps, 1 electronic switch and a capacitor make a
  wonderful S&amp;H circuit. The sampling input is from the output of the
  video switch, because the false syncs trigger LM1881, too.

<li>The delay block delays the vertical sync until the Macrovision region is
  about to begin.

<li>MMV 1 (monostable multivibrator) is triggered when the Macrovision region
  starts and produces a pulse that lasts until the end of the region.

<li>MMV 2 is triggered at the end of the burst gate and it produces a pulse
  that lasts about 45 us == until all false syncs are gone. This MMV must
  not be retriggerable within the pulse, because the false syncs come
  through LM1881 and try to retrigger.

<li>The video output buffer can be a transistor or two. It does not need to
  have any voltage gain, because the VCR has the AGC circuits. If it
  doesn't, you don't need this circuit in the first place!
</ul>

I do have the whole circuit as a 2-color IFF-ILBM picture (Amiga native
format). I am able to convert it into almost any format, if anyone is
interested. Surely no-one is... B^)<p>

<hr>

<a name="MACROVISION_016"><h1> 16) Other methods </h1></a>

One method that I have seen on some old rental cassette is the changing
of horizontal sync amplitude in the middle of a frame. When dubbed, the
AGC circuits change the gain to keep the sync amplitude constant, and
the resulting picture has very noticeable bands of bright and dim
picture.<p>

</pre>


Disadvantages of this method:<p>
<ul>
<li>All the patterns I have seen have been stationary, so you can get used
  to it.
<li>It is effective only in dark pictures; it is virtually not noticeable in
  bright pictures.
<li>If TV/monitor uses sync tip clamping, banding becomes visible, although
  it is less disturbing and reversed:

</pre>

Remedy: clamp to front or back porch and re-create sync.<p>


Another method I have seen is to place a color sub-carrier burst at the
bottom of the horizontal synchronization pulse:<p>

..._      _MM___...
    |    | WW
    |MMMM|
     WWWW
</pre>

The only effect I noticed was that the colors changed a little, when
switching between 'clean' sync and 'bursted' sync. Does anyone
guess what it is supposed to be doing?<p>

OK, this is the end. Thank you for reading. Happy hacking.<p>

I modified the schematic so you can use a single supply voltage (though you 
smart folks would have figured that out anyway).  A voltage between 16-35vdc 
will run this, however if you use a supply over 24vdc you will probably need 
to add a heat sink for the voltage regulators.  I'd like to thank Bill McFadden
for the DC restorer circuit which I show as the LM1201 replacement and left 
his article in tact by only appending the rest of the macrovision circuit to 
his DC restorer.<p>
 
For those who plan to make one I must warn you that I take no responsibility 
for anything.<p>
 
<b>Notes:</b> This also eliminates time codes and close caption information. Sorry 
       about the cryptic schematic but what can you do when all you have is 
       ASCII to work with. If you don't see an &quot;+&quot; at an intersection it 
       isn't connected. All voltages used on A1-A6 are supplied by the two 
       voltage regulators shown at the bottom of this schematic. The op amp,
       used below, must be a video op amp like the RCA CA3100.<p>

<b>NOTES:</b> You can replace some of the pots with fixed resistors if you like. The 
       OFFSET pot can be replaced with a 7.85k to +12v and a 1.43k resistor to 
       ground. The POSITION pot can be replaced with a 6.25k resistor. The 
       WIDTH pot can be replaced with a 6.81k resistor. The BLANKING pot can 
       be replaced with a 4.18k resistor to +12v and a 592ohm resistor to 
       ground. I do not recommend replacing any of the other pots with fixed 
       values. If you do use fixed resistors please skip those steps in the 
       adjustment procedure.<p>

<a name="MACROVISION_021"><h2> 17.4) Timing diagram and adjustment procedure </h2></a>
 
<b>Set up:</b> Connect a scope up to the video input and trigger on vertical sync.
        The second channel will be used for looking at the device being 
        adjusted. Pre-adjust all pots for center position.<p>
 
<ol>
<li>Connect the 2nd channel on the scope up to A3-pin13.
<li>Adjust POSITION so the falling edge of the signal is in the middle of the 
   horiz. line just before the Macrovision pulses (see timing).
<li>Connect the 2nd channel of the scope up to A3-pin5.
<li>Adjust WIDTH so the falling edge of the signal is in the middle of the 
   horizontal line just after the Macrovision pulses (see timing).

<li>Connect the 2nd channel of the scope up to A4-pin4.
<li>Adjust EQ.START so the rising edge of the signal is just after the single
   Macrovision Burst (see timing)
<li>Connect the 2nd channel of the scope up to A4-pin12.
<li>Adjust EQ.WIDTH so the signal is low during the equalization pulses and
   goes high just after the color burst signal (see timing).
<li>Connect the 2nd channel of the scope up to Video Out.
<li>Adjust BLANKING level to match the rest of the videos blanking.
<li>The video output should now look like Macrovision never existed.
<li>Try it!
