<h4>Introduction</h4>
To the best of our knowledge it is legal to use battery cards in Canada
and some Caribbean countries.  We believe it is illegal to use them in
the United States.  This is not a legal opinion.  Battery card users have
had to have their cards reprogrammed twice recently and more reprogramming
is ahead.  Most of those using battery cards never see the programming
involved because there service is maintained by a professional dealer.
Some may wish to maintain there own service or at least have an understanding
of the process. Here is how it is done.  We present this information for
educational purposes only.  The reader alone is responsible for obeying the
laws of the country in which he resides.  Anti-static precautions must
be take during the following procedure.
<p>
<img align=right src="pgm1.jpg">

<h4>1. Install the Master Program</h4>
The first step in programming the battery card is performed by the dealer.
He purchases software which allows him to program a fixed number of cards.
In order to get his own clone IRD numbers he sends in the official smartcard
of an authorized unit.  This keeps the number of clones per master low that
it is not practical for DirecTV to purchase cards in order to try to
obtain the clone ID's.  Part of this program incudes a unique dealer ID.
If a consumer goes to another dealer he will have to have that dealer
reprogram his card with his master program.  The public has no access
to the master program.
<p>
<h4>2. Archive the IRD Number</h4>
It is important to archive the serial number of the IRD so it will always
be possible to return the box to stock condition.  This is impoortant for
authorized customers also.  As long as the IRD number is archived, the board
can always be reprogrammed in case of memory loss.  Boards which have been
modified can the be authorized the same as a box which is fresh from the
factory.  The IRD number is obtained by pressing the TV/DSS and down arrow
buttons simultaneously with the unit powerd up and the smartcard removed
from its slot.  Depressing these buttons puts the box into Service Test
mode.  When the test button is pushed a variety of tests are performed.  The
IRD# is displayed on the first line and it consists of 10 characters.  A
device costing $99 is being sold through magazine ads and it does only
this.
<p>
<h4>3. Programming the Card</h4>
<img align=right src="bcard.jpg">
The card is programmed through the 18 pin edge connector which is on one
end of the card.  Programmers sell for $150-$250 and they will program both
the battery card and the EEPROM in the receiver.  The programmer used in this
demo is the one sold by Open Skies and we had no problems with it.  A
programmer can also be built for about $20 in commonly available parts.
The mainxx file is programmed into the card first and then the IRD number
file is programmed second.  The program used to do this is load.exe and
the current version is 3.17 though earlier versions are circulating.
<p>
The programmer is connected to a parallel printer port via the cable marked
card and the battery card is inserted. The edge connector on the card is
only plated on one side and pins 12 thru 16 on the connector in the
programmers have no connections in case orientation of the card in the
programmer is an issue.  It is necessary to ensure that the card is
inserted so it makes good contact.  Sometimes it is necessary to add 2
or 3 layers of electrical tape on the back of the card.  After the
card is inserted in the programmer it is turned on.  The LED indicates it is
turend on.  Some programmers use a 9 volt battery while others use 155 volts
and a transformer.
<p>
From the directory or disc the following is entered:
<p>
<pre>
c:\program> load main04 [enter]

Load Version 3.17
Using printer port 3BCh
Port not initailized: please remove and re-insert the card.
Hit any key when ready.
Reading 16420 bytes from main04.enc
Timed out.... no Byte ACK

</pre>
This is a common error.  It may usually be corrected by turning the
programmer off and then turning it back on 5 seconds later.  If the
card still does not program, check the cables, and make sure the
card is properly inserted.  It is possible to force the use of
a particular printer port by adding -pn to the command line where
n=3BC, 378 or 278.  The command line would look like this:
<p>
<pre>
load main04 -p378
</pre>
Not that the .enc is not used.  When the card is successfuly programmed
it looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
c:\program> load main04

Using printer port 3BCh
Reading 16420 bytes from main03.enc
Load successful, 16420 bytes sent.
</pre>

Once the mainxx file is loaded into the card the IRD number file must be
loaded.  The number of the file represents the new IRD number which will
appear during the diagnostic test.  It is not the real IRD number.
The IRD number file is of the form xxxxxxxx.enc where x can represent
any hex characters.  For example we will say the file is 21965f29.enc.
Programming is as follows:
<p>
<pre>
c:\program> load 21965f29

Load Version 3.17
Using printer port 3BCh
Reading 3480 bytes from 21965f29.enc
Load successful, 3480 bytes sent.
</pre>
Once the card has been successfully programmed the programmer may be turned
off, and the card may be removed.

<h4>4. Program the EEPROM</h4>
<img align=right src="eeprom.jpg">

U161 is an 8 pin 24C16 EEPROM located in the IRD.  The IRD number stored
in this chip must be the same as that in the card.  The programmers we
have seen have two seprate parallel cables.  This is because the
programmers being sold contain two seprate circuits.  The DB-25 connector
on one is marked <b>card</b> while the other is labeled <b>clip</b>.  The
cable marked clip must be connected to the program the EEPROM.  The
program used is called eep.exe.  The current version is 3.11.
<p>
The 16 pin test clip is connected to U161.  Pins 4, 5, 6 and 8 on IC U161
are used for programming.  Pin 1 is at the top left side of the chip, pin 4
is on the bottom left, pin 5 is on the bottom right and pin 8 is on the top
right hand side.  The micro test clip is connected to the positive side of
C553.  The battery card must be inserted in the card slot for this operation.
Then the receiver is plugged in.  The on/off switch on the programmer is
part of the circuit for programming the card so it is not used.  The file
to be programmed into the EEPROM is the IRD number file, not the mainxx
file.  In this case it is 21965f29.exp.  Progrmming proceeds as follows:
<p>
<pre>
c:\program> eep

EEP Version 3.11
Using printer port 3BCh
Enter ID, CR to exit: 21965F29
21 96 5F 29: OK? [yN]
Y
Programming ID....
Programmed OK
Enter ID, CR to exit:
</pre>
The unit may then be unplugged and the test clips may be removed.
<p>
<h4>5. Finishing the Job</h4>
<img align=right src="inside.jpg">
A standard practice among dealers is to reverse the position of the card
slot as shown in the photo.  This eliminates any potential problem which
could be caused by the end of the batery card protruding fromt he receiver.
Note that the black plastic housing which covers the chips on the cards
prevents proper contact.  If the cardslot is not reversed the black
protective housing may have to be filed back.  A message requesting that
a valid smartcard be inserted probably means that the card is not
inserted far enough.  To do this the front cover of the IRD must be
removed but it is only held in place with plastic clips.  Two clips
were hotglued in the unit we saw but the glue was easily removed.  The
contact pad on the card should face down when it is inserted into the
cardslot.  A dab of hot glue is then used to ensure that the card
does not become loose.  When the black plastic guard which normally
covers the smartcard is put in place it is not obvious that there is
anything different about the unit.  When turned on the box received all
services.
<p>
<h4>6. Restoring the Unit to Stock Condition</h4>
It may be desireable at some point to restore the box to stock condition.
Then it can be authorized like any other unit.  Some battery card users
maintain some level of subscription so they are never without service
during periods when the cards are shut off.  Units which are only subscribed
during periods of card swaps or shutoffs due to ECM's fit a profile
which could target them for additional ECM's.
<p>
In order to return the unit to stock condition it is necessary to use the
first 8 characters of the IRD number which was archived earlier.  In our
example the IRD number was 619C873291.  The steps are exactly the same as in
step 4 except that now the official smartcard
must be inserted into the cardslot instead of the battery card.  When the EEP
program requests the ID to program, the first 8 characters of the IRD number
are entered.  That is 619C8732.  Once compleated, the diagnostic test may
be run to verify that the correct ID has been programmed.  The screen
will read exactly as it does in step 4.
