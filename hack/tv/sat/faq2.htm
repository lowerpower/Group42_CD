1.0 What Is A Scrambling System ?
-===============================-

A  scrambling system is applied to a television signal  to  ensure 
that  it  is  only  receivable by the audience  for  which  it  is 
intended. The more cynical amongst us may rephrase that to  "those 
who  have paid to receive it". Therefore a good scrambling  system 
is  one  that  can effectively make the picture  unusable  to  all 
except those who have paid.

There  are  two  basic  types  of  scrambling  system:  dumb   and 
addressable. The dumb system does not have any over-the-air  (OTA) 
addressing.  As  a result the channel cannot turn  a  subscriber's 
descrambler  off. This type of system is cheap and offers  minimal 
security. As a result it is not used for high value channels.

An addressable scrambling system is more complex in that it allows 
the  channel  to individually turn on and off  descramblers.  Most 
systems in operation today are addressable.

The basis of a scrambling system is the method by which it renders 
the  picture  unwatchable.  The  early  scrambling  systems   were 
analogue.  These  systems  interfered with  the  synch  pulses  or 
inverted  the video either on a frame, field or line  basis.  Some 
actually  delayed  each line by one of three delays on  a  pseudo-
random basis.

All of the analogue scrambling systems were vulnerable and offered 
little  protection  to the channel using them. It was  trivial  to 
build  a  descrambler that worked in an identical  manner  to  the 
official descrambler.

As  the years and technology advanced, more complex  systems  came 
into  operation.  These systems were digital based  systems.  They 
digitised the picture or sound information and manipulated it.  In 
order  to descramble or decode the picture, the picture had to  be 
digitised and then decoded.

VideoCrypt,  D2-MAC  EuroCrypt  M & S and  Nagra  Syster  are  all 
digital  systems. They all digitise the video in order  to  decode 
it. VideoCrypt and D2-MAC use line cut and rotate to scramble  the 
picture.  Nagra Syster uses Line Shuffle to scramble the  picture. 
It takes a block of lines and changes the order. 

All  of the above systems are smart card based. They rely  on  the 
fact that the smart card can be economically replaced in the event 
of  a  hack.  The  concept behind this  is  that  of  "The  Secure 
Detachable Microcontroller". The older systems designs were  based 
on the "Secure Embedded Microcontroller" concept. This concept was 
fundamentally  flawed  in that if there was a hack on  the  secure 
microcontroller  (the chip that held the system's  secrets),  then 
all of the decoders would have to be replaced or upgraded.

1.1 Overview of scrambling in Europe
-==================================-

There  are about six or seven different systems in use in  various 
parts  of  Europe.  The three most  common  ones  are  VideoCrypt, 
EuroCrypt   and Nagravision. Of course there are variants of  each 
of these systems. VideoCrypt 1 and VideoCrypt 2 are good  examples 
of  this  variants  concept. VideoCrypt  comes  in  two  versions, 
VideoCrypt  I and VideoCrypt  II. They are parallel, and the  idea 
is that VC I is to be used  inside the  UK and Ireland, and VC  II 
in the rest of Europe. 

Since Europe is still a multi-copyrights area, there is often  the 
need to sell the programming on one channel to two markets. Rather 
than  create two separate channels, it is often easier to use  the 
same  channel,  with the same scrambling system but  two  distinct 
datastreams.

The  scrambling system is the same - line cut and rotate, but  the 
information to descramble it is encrypted in the VideoCrypt 1  and 
VideoCrypt 2 datastreams. The datastreams are sent out on the  one 
channel.  Therefore the channel is available  both in the  UK  and 
the  continent  using  what  on the  surface  appears  to  be  two 
different systems. Of course this underlines an important flaw  in 
using  two or more datastreams on one scrambling system - if  only 
one  of these datastreams is hacked, then there is effectively  no 
more protection for the channel.

Almost  all  efforts at cracking VideoCrypt has   concentrated  on 
VideoCrypt  1 variant. VideoCrypt 2 has not been much of a  target 
as there is not enough premium programming available to warrant  a 
hack.  There are VideoCrypt 1 <> VideoCrypt 2 adaptors. These  are 
plug-in  boards  with the switchable 68705 / 8752s  that  allow  a 
VideoCrypt  1  decoder to be converted to use as  a  VideoCrypt  2 
decoder and vice versa.

JSTV  is  the  only broadcaster that  broadcasts Europe wide using 
VideoCrypt I. This channel differs from the standard in that it is 
a  very  high  fee channel but it is also  very  much  a  minority 
interest  channel  since it broadcasts programmes for  the  Ex-pat 
Japanese market.

Multiplexed Analogue Component (MAC) is a transmission   standard. 
The  scrambling system overlay is EuroCrypt. EuroCrypt comes in  a 
number  of  variants  (M, S, S2) but according  to  European  law, 
EuroCrypt-M is the European standard. Nobody takes much notice  of 
that anyway.

France  Telecom developed EuroCrypt. Since the system is  open  as 
regards the scrambling algorithms, France Telecom chose a modified 
form  of the US Data Encryption Standard algorithm.  They  removed 
the  initial  and end permutations to make it run  faster  in  the 
smart  card. They also believed that this algorithm would  be  top 
secret and unhackable.

Eurocrypt-M is the commonest.  Only four channels (Sweden 1 and 2, 
Norway  2  and TV Erotica) use Eurocrypt S, the two first  in  the 
less used D-MAC variant.

An older MAC variant, B-MAC, is used by the American  Forces Radio 
and Television Service, The Satellite Information Services  Racing 
Channel  and  several  business TV  applications.  Gradually  this 
system is fading out of use.

The  B-MAC system applies relatively simple line delay  scrambling 
to the MAC video and hard encrypts the digital audio and  teletext 
services.  The  hacks  on  this system  involve  cloning  a  valid 
subscriber  identity  number and then arranging  for  a  continual 
supply  of weekly keys. These keys are programmed into  an  EEPROM 
chip in the decoder.

There are two flavours of B-MAC in operation in Europe: B-MAC  525 
and  B-MAC  625. The numbers refer to the line  numbers.  The  525 
variant  is used for the US AFRTS service and the 625  version  is 
used  for the Racing Channel. Pirate decoders for  these  services 
are expensive, typically costing in excess of five hundred pounds. 
The problem of course is arranging the continual flow of keys.

Nagravision  is also known as Syster and as Nagra, and is used  in 
France,   Spain,  Turkey   and  Germany.  Unlike  VideoCrypt   and 
Eurocrypt,   Nagravision decoder  boxes  are  not for  sale.  They 
are   only  rented  out  to subscribers, but still operate with  a 
smart  card. Nagravision  has not been cracked, and there  are  no 
known pirate cards. Nagravision is  now  replacing  the older  and 
less secure  Discret  system  in France.

Apart from these three big systems, others include Luxcrypt,  used 
by  the  Dutch  RTL networks (a box, no  card  -  decoders  easily 
available)  and  Smartcrypt (box & card, used by  the  French  RTL 
channel;  boxes  now available for sale in France). Even  the  old 
SATPAC  system as used by FilmNet before they switched  to  D2-MAC 
has been used lately.

2.0 HACKING PAY TV 
==================

2.1 Is it legal ?
-===============-

The  cynical  answer would be that it is only illegal if  you  get 
caught.  The  legal  position on hacking varies from  country   to  
country. Basically  a  good rule is that a channel being  uplinked  
from   a particular  country  is  probably going to be   protected  
by   that country's  laws. For example hacking Sky in  the  United 
Kingdom   is  illegal under that country's laws.  However  hacking 
FilmNet  in  the UK may not be directly protected under  the  UK's 
law.  TV1000 on the other hand is partially uplinked from  the  UK 
and   is  therefore  protected  under  UK  law  even  though   the 
pornography  transmitted on the channel would not be permitted  to 
be  uplinked  from  the UK. A rather sly sidestep gets around this 
issue - the hardcore pornography is not uplinked from the UK.

In  fact,  TV1000  has  threatened  UK dealers with  legal  action 
many  times but with few results. The problem of piracy on  TV1000 
in the UK has got to such a state that taking legal action against 
one or two dealers would not have any greater effect.

Europe  is still a multi-copyright area. It is therefore  possible 
for Sky and FilmNet to purchase the rights to show the same  film. 
Perhaps in the future, the copyright issue will be worked out  and 
we  will have a single copyright area for Europe, but for  now  we 
have to cope with the current mess.

To  date most of the prosecutions for piracy in the UK  have  been 
against people who have been  too visible. It is not  economically 
viable for a channel  to prosecute  every  user of a pirate  smart 
card.  Instead   they  will generally concentrate on  dealers  and 
distributors. 

Of course they may also decide to make an example of an individual 
pirate  card user. The logic of the legal departments of  channels 
is not as predictable as that of their engineering departments.

If you get caught you are unlikely to be able to plead any  clever 
excuse   that  you  may come up with. More importantly, could  you 
afford the expensive legal mouthpiece to argue your case?


2.2 VideoCrypt Smart Cards
-========================-

On 31/10/95 Sky switched over to the new 10 card. The  fundamental 
result of this is that ALL season programs and pirate smart  cards 
do not work anymore.

Pirate smart cards are cards that have been manufactured to hack a 
channel.  They are, in most cases totally different from  official 
smart cards. The majority of these cards are based on the PIC16Cxx 
series  of microcontrollers. Other variations have been  seen  but 
the PIC16Cxx cards are the commonest.

Over the past few months, the more expensive end of the market has 
tended  towards  the  Battery Cards. These cards  use  the  Dallas 
Semiconductors FP5002 secured microcontroller and are updatable by 
the  card user. It is simply a question of dialing a phone  number 
and getting the set of numbers to punch into the Battery Card.

There is also a trade in what are referred to as Grey Market smart 
cards.  These  are official cards, that are  exported  to  another 
country.  Generally  it  is a one for one trade  with  the  broker 
taking  a  commission. For example, a Sky  subscription  would  be 
taken  out  in  the UK and a FilmNet subscription would  be  taken  
out   in  Sweden.   The  cards  would  then be   swapped   via   a  
broker.   The  subscriptions  would be kept up  to  date  by  both 
parties.  The  legal position  on  this activity is not  clear  as 
the  channels  benefit from the transaction in that they both  get 
subscriptions. It  does rely on mutual trust.

Purchasing  a  pirate card involves risk. There is  a  probability 
that  the pirate card will be killed in the future.  The  channels 
will  implement  electronic countermeasures to try and  kill   the  
pirate  cards.  Technically speaking, no pirate card can  ever  be 
100% safe. This  point  has  been proven too frequently  over  the  
last  few months.

The  system  used  by FilmNet Plus and TV1000  (among  others)  is 
EuroCrypt-M.  This system has been continually hacked since  1992. 
In  terms  of value for money, users of EuroCrypt-M  pirate  smart 
cards  have  fared better. This is because the channels  have  not 
frequently  implemented  countermeasures. Of  course  the   recent 
countermeasure by TV1000 has had a devastating effect. Most of the 
pirate smart cards have been knocked out. 

The  VideoCrypt system, as used by Sky and the Adult Channel,  has 
been  updated more regularly. The present Sky card is issue 10  or 
in  technical  terms, the 0A card. It is commonly referred  to  as 
issue 10 but the reason for the 0A reference is purely  technical. 
In hexadecimal, the number 10 is represented as 0A.

In  addition to issuing a  new smart  card every year or  so,  Sky 
and  News  Datacom also  implement countermeasures  to  knock  out 
pirate smart  cards. Over  the  last few months, the time  between 
these countermeasures has only been a few weeks. For about a month 
preceding the switch to 10, Sky was in a transition from issue  09 
to  10. Therefore they did not execute that many ECMs during  that 
period. This is because the 10 card only had a simplified  version 
of the 09 algorithm in order to cope during this transition stage.

As   a direct result ECMs such as key changes, many of the  pirate 
cards have had to be  sent back  to  the  dealer for upgrade. Some  
innovative  pirates  have designed their cards (The Battery Cards) 
so that they can be upgrade by the  customer. The  solutions   for 
the  countermeasures  are recorded as a  set  of numbers   on   an 
answering machine. The customer  rings  the  phone number with the 
answering  machine and gets the update numbers.  He  then   enters  
them   into   the pirate card via  a  key  pad.   Other  solutions 
such as a modem on the pirate card have also been seen.

In  real terms, anyone purchasing a pirate card is taking a  risk. 
The pirate card will eventually be hit by a countermeasure. If  it 
is  not,  then  the channel may issue a new smart  card  with  the 
consequence that all of the old pirate smart cards will be knocked 
out.

The  cost  of the new pirate 10 cards, when they hit  the  market, 
will  be in the region of two hundred pounds or so. At  present  a 
price of 498 DM is being quoted by one pirate card vendor.

FAQ - Decoding Pay TV (European Scrambling Systems) - 1.4 (Part 2 Of 2)

===========================
Last Update: 20-Nov-95
===========================

2.3 What is Season or Omigod software?
-====================================-

At the time of writing, NONE of the Season programs are working on 
channels encrypted with the 10 codes. There have been at least two 
spoof  attempts  over  the last few weeks. One of  this  is  named 
SEASON10.ZIP and is very definitely a fake.

The   Season software began life as an attempt by Markus Kuhn  and 
others to watch  the  final season  of  Star Trek: TNG. The  final 
season was season  7.  As  a result,  the first working PC program 
that  decoded Sky  was  named SEASON7.  The first version of  this 
program  appeared  in  March  of 1994. At the  time,  the  current 
issue  of  the  Sky card was Issue  7.  Therefore  some  confusion 
arose.

The  term  Omigod  (Oh  My God!) was also  used  to  describe  the 
programs. Well the preceding hack using the PIC cards was known as 
the  Ho  Lee Fook hack! Over the months from March  to  May  1994,  
versions  for  different computers appeared. Many  of  these  were 
posted on the alt.satellite.tv.europe newsgroup.

On  May  18th 1994 Sky changed from issue 07 cards to  their   new 
issue  09 card. In hacker terms, May 18th is referred to  as  Dark 
Wednesday.  The  09  card proved harder to hack  but  a  temporary 
solution appeared in June of that year. It only lasted a few  week 
before  Sky changed codes again. Though some attempts at an  issue 
09  SEASON  hack were made, the change of code by Sky  stopped  it 
cold. Well at least until just before Christmas.

Last  Christmas,  no less than three versions of the  SEASON  hack 
appeared. Two of them worked on the PC and the other one worked on 
the  Apple MAC. Of course Sky was paying attention and on  January 
4th  1995,  they  implemented a countermeasure  that  knocked  out 
pirate cards and all of the SEASON hacks. The war between Sky  and 
the pirates had recommenced. Updated versions of the SEASON  hacks 
became   available. This spiral  of countermeasure and update  has 
continued  until the present. The issue of the new Sky  card,  has 
changed the situation somewhat. The VideoCrypt SEASON hack is  now 
living on borrowed time.

The  algorithm in the 09 card issue is far more  complex than  the 
one  used in the 07 card. While the 07 algorithm was   not  really  
designed   to be  extremely upgradable, the 09  algorithm  is   an 
extremely flexible algorithm. No doubt the 10 card algorithm  will 
build heavily on the lessons of the 09.

At present only The Adult Channel (UK soft porn) and Eurotica  (UK 
Hard Core Porn) are decoded by VideoCrypt SEASON programs. None of 
the  official  Sky channels will be decoded by any of  the  SEASON 
programs available.


2.4 Where can I get the software from ?
-======================================-

Currently  there are working versions of the SEASON hacks for  the 
Adult Channel and Eurotica available on almost every European BBS. 
There  are  many  ftp and webpages (WWW) where  the  programs  are 
freely  available.  There  are no  known   versions   that   cover 
VideoCrypt 2. (A hack on JSTV was claimed a few months ago).

There  are many version of SEASON: Voyager, SEASON, Freeview  etc. 
All  of these have stopped working on the Sky channels  since  Sky 
switched  to  their  10  cards. However  in  the  meantime,  these 
programs  are  available  at all good sites, a few  of  which  are 
listed below.


ftp:

 ftp.uni-erlangen.de
     /pub/Multimedia/VideoCrypt/     

 ftp.paranoia.com
     /pub/users/defiant
     
 ftp.ua.pt
     /pub/misc/satellite

 helvetica.gw.chnet.ch



Note the capital letters and the forward slashes (/). They do make 
a  difference  as most of the ftp sites are run  on  UNIX  systems 
where the case of the characters makes a difference.



2.5 The Season Cardadapter
-========================-

The computer has to be connected to the VideoCrypt decoder via  an 
interface. This interface is sometimes referred to as an Omigod or 
Season  interface. It is essentially a simple design  that  allows 
the  RS232 serial port of the computer to be connected to the  TTL 
levels  of  the card socket. Most of the versions  of  the  Season 
software  include a text file on the construction details of  this 
interface in a file called ADAPTER.TXT.

Details of the adapter are on Erlangen in the directory :

     /pub/Multimedia/VideoCrypt/cardadapter/



The artwork for making the PCB interface is available in postcript 
form at:

ftp harley.pcl.ox.ac.uk
     /pub/crypt/smartpc/smart.ps

ftp joule.pcl.ox.ac.uk
     /pub/mark/smart.ps

http://joule.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~mark/sat.html

http://www.paranoia.com/~defiant

http://www.gpl.net/paulmax

This  software uses very accurate timing for the  decoding,  there 
are  several reports that this software runs OK on  some  machines 
and not on others. Please expect problems and try slowing your CPU 
down  as a first fix. Problems are reported about  different  COMM 
cards,  Memory Managers and so called Serial Device drivers  (like 
fossils).  It's  best  to run the Season  software  on  a  'clean' 
machine


2.6 I can't ftp. Can someone post it for me ?
-===========================================-

If  you  can't  use  ftp  from  your  account  then  get  yourself 
acquainted  with  ftpmail.  As well as allowing  you  to  get  the 
software  yourself and keeping traffic in the group down, it  will 
also enable you  to get any software on any subject !

For  details  of how to use ftpmail send a message with  the  word 
"help"in the body to:

bitftp@wm.gmd.de
ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de
ftpmail@grasp.insa.lyon.fr
ftpmail@ieunet.ie
ftpmail@plearn.edu.pl
ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk

The files will be returned in a format known as uuencoded.  You'll 
need a uudecoder to make these into useful files. These are widely 
available for all platforms although if you can't ftp you'll  have 
to  work out how to get one. More details on email use of the  net 
are on Super Channel CNBC text page 188.

2.7 What are blockers and what is Phoenix?
-========================================-

In  the middle of the summer of 1994, there was little success  in 
hacking  Sky. A program was written in the TV-CRYPT for testing  a 
theory.  The theory dealt with the over the air addressing  system 
on  VideoCrypt. The question was: "could the  presently  available 
knowledge be used to switch on or off a Sky  card?". At that time, 
the  available knowledge consisted of the fragment of the 09  code 
that was killed in June and a working knowledge of how Sky encoded 
card  numbers  in  their  over  the  air  addressing  system.  The 
available knowledge was sufficient.

The  computer  program  written  to test  the  theory  was  called 
Phoenix.   Since  most  of  the  cards  experimented   upon   were 
Quickstarts  that Sky had killed, Phoenix, the mythical bird  that 
rises from its own ashes seemed a good name.

Of  course the program fell into the hands of commercial  pirates. 
The  Phoenix  program on its own was useful to switch  on  the  09 
Quickstarts that Sky had killed. It was also being used to  switch 
on  all  channels  on  a Sky  card  with  only  the  Multichannels 
subscription.  It was a Musketeer hack - all for one and  one  for 
all. But that hack name had already been used.

Unfortunately these reactivated cards were only lasting a few days 
before   being killed again by Sky. Then when Sky increased  their 
kill cycle the cards only lasted a few hours. Some solution had to 
be found.

The solution lay in a hack of 1992 - the KENtucky Fried Chip. This 
was a modified version of the smart card - decoder microcontroller 
in the VideoCrypt decoder. It stopped Sky from turning off a  card 
by  examining each over the air packet for the identity number  of 
the  card  in the  card socket and stopping  such  a  packet  from 
reaching  the smart card. Sky could not kill the card because  the 
card never received the kill instruction.

Of course the chip used in the decoder was too expensive and there 
was  a rather large number of redundant PIC16C84 chips  available. 
The first blockers to hit the market had the blocking program in a 
PIC16C84.  They consisted of a card socket, a PIC16C84 and a  PCB. 
The  official card, having being activated by the Phoenix  program 
would  then only be used in the blocker. Luckily it was not  named 
the Condom hack.

Of  course  the  popularity  of  these  devices  soon  meant  that 
individually  activating  the Quickstart cards  with  the  Phoenix 
program was taking too much time. The solution was to  incorporate 
the Phoenix routines in the PIC16C84. These new blockers were more 
successful.  Over  the months from August to November,  they  were 
given   a  bewildering  array  of  names;   Genesis,   SunBlocker, 
Sh*tblocker, Exodus. 

Naturally Sky were a little upset with this resurrection of  their 
dead  cards. Their response, at first was purely technical.  Later 
in  1994,  they took legal action in the Uk  against  some  people 
supplying blockers.

There  was  more  to  the VideoCrypt 09  smart  card  than  people 
realised.  The most important aspect was that Sky  could  actually 
write to the card. The instructions for doing this were carried in 
the  same  packets that carried the  activation  and  deactivation 
instructions.

The  blockers only looked for the specific identity number of  the 
card  in the card socket. As long as that identity number did  not 
appear in the packet, it was let straight through to the card. Sky 
had managed to knock out a number of cards while they were in  the 
blockers.

Some  of  these countermeasures were reversible in that  the  card 
itself  was not completely dead. One of Sky's countermeasures  did 
actually  hit the card in a manner that effectively locked it.  At 
that  point,  the blockers were becoming irrelevant -  there  were 
working pirate smart cards for VideoCrypt.

The  Phoenix  program, in various guises, still works.  Of  course 
some  of  the  newer smart cards from Sky have been  found  to  be 
resistant to being activated with Phoenix.

At  present  there is some PIC source code that has  been  labeled 
10BLOCK.ZIP. It is believed that this is not actually the code for 
a 10 Blocker but merely 09 Blocker code that does not work on  10. 
Using  this  code in the hope that it would stop a 10  card  being 
killed is dangerous to say the least.


2.8 Is there a D2-MAC EuroCrypt-M Version of The Season Hack?
-===========================================================-

The simple answer is yes. The main program is MACcess. Though  the 
original  author of the MACcess program did not update it  due  to 
the sheer abuse of the program. The comments from a few ungrateful 
idiots wanting the new version and at the same time insulting  the 
original author for not supporting the program irritated not  only 
the author but many hackers as well.

Someone has patched the new FilmNet and TV1000 keys into an  early 
version of the program. The patched program is available on  BBSes 
and ftp sites as MAXS-15A.ZIP

The  EuroCrypt-M  system  is DES based.  In an   ironic   way  the 
system's greatest strength  was  its  greatest weakness. Again the 
progression  from  pirate  smart card  to  computer  program   was 
apparent. 

Another key change by FilmNet is expected in the next few weeks.

2.9 Is there a hack on Nagra?
-============================-

There  is no OMIGOD program for hacking Nagra. What  occurred  was 
that  some  JAFA  from the  English  consumer  publication,  "What 
Satellite"  heard about a program for monitoring the  Nagra  card-
decoder  communications  and  ignorantly assumed that  it  was  an 
OMIGOD hack.

Though there is possibly a smartcard based hack, the main  problem 
is  getting  an  adequate supply of  Syster  decoders.  Of  course 
marketing  the  hack  in the home area of  the  channel  would  be 
suicidal.

It  would  be easy to replicate  the  pirate smart  card  but  the 
decoders  are  not  easy to get.  Therefore  with  access  to  the 
decoders  controlled  it  is a very  good   demonstration  of  the 
philosophy of total access control.


2.10 PIC Source code for hacks
-============================-

Since  late  April,  there has been no security  on  the  PIC16C84 
microcontrollers.  This  is ironic  because  this  microcontroller 
formed  the  backbone  of the European piracy  business.  In  late 
April,  the  information  on  popping  (extracting  the  protected 
contents  of  the chip's memory) the PIC16C84 was published  in  a 
USENET newsgroup. An article on this can be found on the following 
webpages:

http://www.hackwatch.com/~kooltek/picbust

http://www.iol.ie/~kooltek/picbust 

As  a  result of this information being published on  the  USENET, 
result  everybody found out how to pop the PIC. All the  code  for 
the D2-MAC hacks and the Sky hacks were laid bare.

The source code for the PIC based D2-MAC cards is widely available 
on the net. The following WWW pages have D2-MAC code:

http://www.paranoia.com/~defiant

http://www.gpl.net/paulmax  


2.11 Other Smart Card Projects
-============================-

A  number  of designs of DIY smart cards for  VideoCrypt  appeared 
during the lifetime of the 09 card. With the switch to 10, most of 
these became redundant unless the software could be converted  for 
D2-MAC. As soon as we establish which ones are converted or are in 
the process of being converted, we will list them in this FAQ.


3.0 FINDING OUT MORE
====================

3.1 Who are / what is the TV-CRYPT and how can I subscribe ?
-==========================================================-

The TV-CRYPT is a closed mailing list. It was set up to enable the 
discussion of the methods and technology of TV scrambling systems. 
It  is  more of a forum for the exchange of  ideas  than  anything 
else.

Contrary  to  popular  belief,  it  is  not  a  private  means  of 
distributing  the most recent copies of software for hacking  Sky. 
Neither is it an "elite" group of super hackers whose sole  intent 
is to hack channels just to watch the movies.

It  is  an  "by invitation only" list. If you  can  demonstrate  a 
knowledge  of  scrambling systems through your posts here  in  the 
newsgroup, then you may be invited to join.

3.2 Reading List
-==============-

Obviously the new developments will be listed in further  versions 
of  this FAQ. Since this FAQ will be posted every few  weeks  from 
now on, it should be a fairly good source of information.

The de-facto standard text on encryption and scrambling systems is 
John  Mc  Cormac's Black Book. Currently in edition  4,  the  book 
gives  the reader a complete overview of the industry and  systems 
in use in Europe.

4.0 Netiquette On A.S.T.E  &  A.S.T.C  &  R.V.S.E
=================================================

The  first  rule is that there are no hard and fast  rules.  There 
are,  however  some  protocols  designed to  reduce  the  risk  of 
incineration.

The newsgroups alt.satellite.tv.europe and  alt.satellite.tv.crypt 
are  the groups where overt discussion of scrambling  systems  and 
attacks on scrambling systems are considered worthy topics.

A  few  months  ago, there was a schism  in  the  newsgroups.  The 
standard     European     satellite     television      newsgroup, 
alt.satellite.tv.europe     split    into    two.    The     first 
rec.video.satellite.europe, became part of the REC hierarchy. This 
is  the proper group for discussion of general European  satellite 
television  topics.  Please do not post messages  asking  for  the 
latest  hack  on  the  R.V.S.E  group.  The  second  group  became 
alt.satellite.tv.crypt. 

The  alt.satellite.tv.crypt newsgroup is where the  discussion  of 
scrambling  systems  and  hacking is meant  to  be  conducted.  It 
started  out as a European group but there are  many  non-European 
readers.  The  alt.satellite.tv.europe group was  supposed  to  be 
phased out but this does not seem to have happened yet.

Please  bear in mind that some people have to pay to download  the 
newsgroups.  In  the past few months there have been a  few  flame 
wars     about    posting    UUENCODED    binaries    into     the 
alt.satellite.tv.crypt  and  alt.satellite.tv.europe  groups.  The 
argument  on this is that the procedure is now to upload any  file 
to  a  popular ftp site and announce that it  is  available  there 
rather than posting it as a UUENCODED message. 

Advertising  of devices on the newsgroups is another subject  that 
draws strong reactions. It is unfortunately now a fact of life. If 
you  have to advertise, then observe the standard Usenet  protocol 
of including the word AD or ADVERT in the subject line. Only  post 
to  the groups where relevant. If you are posting an advert for  a 
device  with  European  usage  do not post  in  the  US  satellite 
newsgroups.

In   many  European  countries  there  are complex   legal   rules  
regarding  'goods to be  used  for  criminal purpose'. If we  keep 
the  discussion at an 'educational' level, for personal   use  the 
group  should attract much less attention.  There is  also a  grey 
area  of the law that is presently  untested.  This surrounds  the 
possible  prosecution  of Internet service  providers  because  of 
material  they  carry.  If  the newsgroup  becomes  a   source  of 
software  for hacking pay TV you may find your site  removes   it, 
just  as  some providers strip  the  alt.binaries.pictures.erotica 
groups.
