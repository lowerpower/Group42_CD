Digital TV Tests By News Datacom
</H1>
<HR>

News Datacom has announced that they have successfully test  their 
digital television system via ASTRA. The system is said to be  the 
European  version of the American Digital Satellite System.  Which 
is of course unfortunate given the news earlier in the magazine. 
<P>
The  advent of digital television may set back the  implementation 
of  a single European Copyright area so much so that it may  never 
become  a reality. The common conception of digital television  is 
that it will offer a plethora of channels with a single receiver.
<P>
While  this may be so, it also offers the programme provider  more 
control  over  the  audience.  The  closest  Europe  has  come  to 
regionalised programming is the now defunct BSB EuroCypher  system 
and  the  D2-MAC EuroCrypt-M. Both of these  systems  offered  the 
possibility of regionalised programming. The EuroCrypt-M system is 
actually used in this manner with FilmNet and TV3.
<P>
News  Datacom  and  Sky hope to introduce  their  new  Digital  TV 
service  to Europe later this year. It is not known what  type  of 
smart card they will use.
