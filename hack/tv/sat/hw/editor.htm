There  is  an  old  Chinese  curse that  runs  "may  you  live  in 
interesting times". It seems that the European satellite  business 
is so cursed. 
</P>
<P></P>
Perhaps  the ultimate victims of this curse are News  Datacom  and 
Sky. The level of piracy on a channel is a very good indicator  of 
how  popular that channel is. Sky has perhaps one of  the  highest 
levels  of piracy in Europe. This is due in no small part  to  the 
counter-piracy policy adopted by Sky.
</P><P>
Exactly two years ago this month, in March 1993, Sky destroyed its 
own  security department. The documents that could have saved  Sky 
from  the  ensuing two years of piracy were  shredded.  The  idiot 
responsible for the destruction of the security department  should 
be  kicked out of Sky and never allowed to work in  the  satellite 
television business again.
</P><P>
But VideoCrypt was once a secure system. When Sky switched to  the 
long  cycle, it was compromised. By having a year or more  between 
card  issues,  it was possible for the hackers to come up  with  a 
solution.  However the market for pirate devices is so large  that 
there  is  a  lot of serious financial  clout  behind  attacks  on 
scrambling systems. With an estimated &#163 500,000,000 per year  being 
spent  in  Europe  on satellite and  cable  piracy,  the  Blackbox 
industry is bigger than many channels.
</P><P>
The lemmings rush into digital television in Europe is going to be 
greeted with the usual cheery forecasts from the "media analysts". 
They  seem to be utterly oblivious to the effects of piracy  on  a 
channel's  revenues. Extrapolating Sky's estimate of their  losses 
over the first three months of 1994 and adding in the cost of  the 
09 card issue gives a figure close to &#163 40 Million. The real figure 
is probably much higher and may approach this without the cost  of 
the 09 included. 
</P><P>
It might sound a bit like harsh criticism of "media analysts"  but 
there has been little evidence of sentient life on the planet they 
inhabit.  Whatever  planet  it is it certainly is  not  this  one. 
Perhaps  I am getting too cynical after editing and  writing  Hack 
Watch News for four years. 
</P><P>
Digital  television  has the capacity to  revolutionise  satellite 
television in Europe. It also has the capacity to destroy it. Most 
of the "media analysts" tend to believe what they are told by  the 
security systems providers - and sure why wouldn't they? They  are 
after all non-technical people. The scary part is that it is these 
JAFAs who are ultimately deciding things.
</P><P>
The  fundamental  flaw in most of the digital  television  systems 
proposed  for  use in Europe is that they tend to  rely  on  smart 
cards. To date most of the smart card systems have been hacked  in 
Europe.  The  only system that has remained intact is  the  Syster 
system.   It  remained  intact  because  the  channels  using   it 
maintained control over the decoders.
</P><P>
If  the  channel groups intending to go digital  do  not  maintain 
security  over  their decoders / IRDs as well as  over  the  smart 
cards then they are as good as hacked.
</P><P>
The  present generation of smart cards are currently  hacked.  The 
companies  that manufactured the cards did not expect such a  well 
organised,  well  financed  and well armed attack  on  the  cards. 
Perhaps  they  had  been too confused by  work  with  banks.  News 
Datacom  were certainly afflicted with this mentality. They  chose 
to  deny  that  there was a piracy problem  on  their  cards.  The 
typical  opponent envisaged by the card manufacturers seems to  be 
the  highstreet criminal. While smart cards are a  good  deterrent 
against   the   average  criminal,  the  real  opponent   is   the 
professional  hacker  /  pirate. These people  will  have  similar 
training  to  the card developers and perhaps access to  the  same 
level  of equipment. In addition there will be thousands  more  of 
them.
</P><P>
The  number of people trying to hack a system will  outnumber  the 
number  of  people who designed it. The people  who  designed  the 
system  are  fighting a perpetually losing battle. It is  only  by 
changing  the cards on a regular basis that they can hope to  stem 
the  flow of piracy. This simple lesson is often the one that  the 
channels pay most to learn.
