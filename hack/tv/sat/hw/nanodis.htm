NanoCommands Disappear - 0A  Launch Imminent?
</H2>
<HR>
<P>
The sudden disappearance of the nanocommands from Sky's datastream 
have  given  hackers cause for worry. The  nanocommands  are  data 
packets that can be used to reprogram the smart card over the air. 
They also can be used to make the card execute some subroutines in 
the  algorithm.  These subroutines are intended to  make  it  more 
difficult to hack the algorithm to obtain the correct key table.
<P>
Rumours  of 0A cards appearing throughout the UK have surfaced  in 
the  past  few  weeks. The distribution  appears  to  be  somewhat 
sporadic at the moment. The last time that Sky introduced a  card, 
the  UK was broken down into sections. The cards were  distributed 
in  one  section  at a time. When the all  the  subscribers  in  a 
section had new cards, the cards would be distributed to the  next 
section.
<P>
This  method of distribution will probably be used  to  distribute 
the  0A  card. Perhaps it is based on the  UK's  postcode  system. 
Ireland, not having a postcode system, was the last to be supplied 
with  the  new card. Of course this may have had something  to  do 
with  the  fact that Sky had at that point in time lost  to  David 
Lyons in the Irish High Court.
<P>
This  year things are different. Sky has moved to try  and  secure 
its  home market (the UK) from piracy.  They achieved a  permanent 
injunction  against  David Lyons preventing him  from  dealing  in 
pirate  Sky devices. Sky's legal moves over the last seven  months 
have been more intense than those over the preceding two years.
<P>
However  the  legal  moves by Sky have not  deterred  hackers  and 
pirates. In fact if anything they have hardened the resolve of  UK 
based  pirates. So it seems that the situation is rapidly  turning 
into the same one that preceded Dark Wednesday last year.
<P>
Sky, by their own admission in the BSkyB Vs BSB Electronics  case, 
considered  it  economically non-viable to to pursue  all  of  the 
pirate  card dealers in the three months prior to Dark  Wednesday. 
The  same  situation with the pirate 09 cards  applies  today.  It 
would  be  financial suicide to pursue all of the UK  pirate  card 
dealers  through the courts. It is something that Sky may have  to 
consider  if  and  when the 0A card is  hacked.  In  the  Blackbox 
industry  in the UK, it seems that Sky is only going for the  high 
profile  pirates.  Those who stick their heads above  the  parapet 
almost invariably get them shot off. The fact that most UK pirates 
are  now maintaining a low profile has given Sky a false sense  of 
security.
<P>
The  VideoCrypt system is now totally hacked and there are  freely 
available  emulators  on BBSes and internet sites.  Sky  would  be 
foolish  in the extreme to think that they can let this  situation 
continue.  The  stockholders and the stockmarket  will  eventually 
find out. Though given the class of idiot that passes for a "media 
analyst" it would be a surprise if the stockmarket were even aware 
of the revenue that Sky loses to piracy on a monthly basis.
<P>
Though  the parallels between the current situation and that  that 
existed  pre Dark  Wednesday are clear, the user  of  the  pirate 
device  does not have the same blind confidence. Most pirate  card 
dealers are offering no guarantee with the pirate card. Of  course 
in the effort to win back customers, the pirates have advanced the 
technology.  The  modem  update  for pirate  cards  is  already  a 
reality.
<P>
The  adverts  (inset)  appeared in Satellite TV  Europe  and  What 
Satellite  magazines.  These are UK magazines.  The  whole  pirate 
smart card business in the UK is out of control and there is  very 
little  that  can  be done to stop it. It  is  almost  a  foregone 
conclusion that all official smart cards will be hacked.
<P>
Sky,  despite  anything that their PR and  legal  departments  may 
claim have lost control of their home market. They have also  lost 
control  over  the  technology. The problem  is  that  they  still 
believe  in  the  theory that the new 0A card will  cure  all  the 
piracy on the system.
<P>
On  a normal system this would be the case. However Sky  and  News 
Datacom  left the fundamental principle of VideoCrypt far  behind. 
The  card  has to be changed on a regular basis every  six  or  so 
months. It seems that VideoCrypt was never designed to handle  the 
volume of subscribers that it now handles. Changing the cards  for 
a  couple  of hundred thousand viewers may be a  relatively  cheap 
operation.  Changing  the cards for a few million viewers  is  far 
from cheap. It cost Sky L21 Million for the 09 Card issue.
<P>
It  was pointed out that generally engineers have a poor grasp  of 
economics. Perhaps this is so but the argument could be made  that 
accountants and economists have a poor grasp of security.
<P>
At  this point in time it is not known how much Sky is paying  for 
the new 0A card issue. Perhaps they may even get a discount due to 
the  failure  of the security on the 09 card. Joking  aside,  some 
questions  remain about the security of the 0A card.  Perhaps  the 
most important is what Sky will do if the card is hacked.
