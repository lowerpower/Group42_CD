Sky Vs RSD - A Case Of Terminal Decline
</H1>
<HR>
<P>
The action by Sky against RSD took a turn for the absurd recently. 
The UK consumer publication, ``What Satellite?'' contacted BSkyB's 
legal   department  about  the  actual  definition  of  the   word 
``terminal'' in the Sky Subscriber Agreement. The reply confounded 
the  industry. According to the enlightened people in Sky's  legal 
department a ``terminal'' is a television set.
<P>
It takes a while to sink in doesn't it? These people consider  the 
terminal  as  being  the  television set while  the  rest  of  the 
satellite television industry always considered the decoder/IRD as 
being the terminal.
<P>
Perhaps  it  is  just a case of  technological  ignorance.  It  is 
common,  in  large computer systems and businesses, for  the  non-
technical to refer to individual computers as terminals. It  would 
not be difficult to see the same mindset declaring the  television 
as  a terminal. After all the data, in this case the  programming, 
is displayed on the television screen, which to the  non-technical 
might just appear like the screen on the terminal.
<P>
How  the  Hell  could  anyone in Sky be so  stupid  as  to  define 
``terminal''  as being the television set? While  internally  they 
might  have  gotten  away  with it but  in  the  real  world,  and 
especially when talking to the leading Uk consumer publication, it 
was downright moronic.
<P>
This  interpretation of the term is so wide that it means  that  a 
television  shop  supplying RF splitters and cable to  someone  to 
connect  a second television to their satellite receiver would  be 
guilty of an offence under the UK Copyright Patents and Design Act 
1988.
<P>
The  claim  by  Sky's legal department that the  television  is  a 
terminal is clearly illogical. It is also skating very close to an 
unenforcable   contract.  How  can  Sky  actually  check  that   a 
subscriber  is  not routing the descrambled picture  to  a  second 
television set?
<P>
Over  the  past few years, the Sky Subscriber Agreement  has  been 
edited by Sky with the grace of a ballet dancing elephant. All the 
time  it is being tilted more in the favour of Sky. While  on  the 
surface these changes were to clear up ambiguities, the reality is 
that they are being made to try and enforce security that has been 
sadly lacking from the actual scrambling system.
<P>
While recent legislation in the UK made it legal for a consumer to 
record  a  television program in order to watch it  later,  (time-
shifting),  Sky is attempting to counter this by including in  its 
Subscriber Agreement terms that preclude this.
<P>
According   to   ``What   Satellite'',   the   clause    `copying, 
redistributing  or  relaying the service or any  of  the  channels 
other than in the premises and for personal domestic use' has been 
changed to `copying, redistributing or relaying the service or any 
of the channels in the premises or elsewhere.' The article goes on 
to point out that the these new terms do not apply to  subscribers 
with older Subscriber Agreements.
<P>
Sky  neglected  to issue new Subscriber Agreements  with  the  new 
terms to all of the subscribers with older contracts. Since  these 
changes  have rather far reaching effects, they would  necessitate 
at least some explanation to the subscriber.
<P>
Basically it is not possible to be party to an agreement that  you 
are  unaware of. It is a matter of consent. If the Sky  Subscriber 
Agreement is an open ended contract that allows Sky to change  the 
terms without notifying the subscriber then it does not seem to be 
valid.
<P>
The  theory of a secure access control system was lost on Sky  and 
News  Datacom.  In  the race to acquire subscribers  they  had  to 
assemble  a scrambling system in about a year or so. This  is  far 
short  of  the  typical development  timescale  for  a  scrambling 
system. The VideoCrypt system was very much a potpourri of various 
scrambling  patents  from  Thomson and an  access  control  system 
provided by News Datacom.
<P>
While  the original system was good, it tended to ignore the  fact 
that it was to be deployed in the most hostile piracy  environment 
on the planet.
<P>
News  Datacom  had  indoctrinated  Sky  into  believing  in  total 
security.  Unfortunately  the reality was that there  is  no  such 
thing, especially so in satellite television field.
<P>
The  secure access control system aspect of the VideoCrypt  system 
collapsed on one point. When Sky lost control over the decoders it 
lost control over the system.
<P>
Over  that particular period in time, (1989 - 1990), Sky  were  in 
what  was  a very dangerous financial  position.  Every  satellite 
television journalist had an undated obituary for Sky ready,  just 
in case.
<P>
As  the  fight  between  BSB and Sky grew  more  intense,  it  was 
necessary to flood the market and get subscribers. So it could  be 
argued  that at the expense of security, it was necessary  to  get 
subscribers.
<P>
From a financial view point this was probably the correct decision 
but it only created problems that are all too apparent today.
<P>
By  comparison, the German channel Premiere has a better grasp  of 
realities  both  in terms of security and finance.  They  maintain 
ownership  of the Syster decoders. The subscriber only  rents  the 
decoder.  If the subscriber ``loses'' the decoder, he  also  loses 
his deposit. This is a perfect implementation of an access control 
system  because  not only does the channel control access  to  the 
programming, it also controls access to the means of accessing the 
programming - the decoder.
<P>
The  antics  of Sky's legal department over the  last  few  months 
appear  to be somewhat of an attempt to impose order on a  chaotic 
system.
<P>
They lost the technological battle a long time ago so now they are 
trying to fight on a new battleground - the courts.  Unfortunately 
while the Sky legal people wallow in the eighteenth century  mire, 
the industry is rapidly moving towards the twenty-first century.
<P>
The  core of their problem is not the subscriber, nor  the  pirate 
but rather the VideoCrypt system. At one time it was a good system 
but now it is a dinosaur. No amount of legal tooing and froing  is 
going to save it.
<P>
There  has  got  to be a deeper reason for the  move  against  the 
TwoView.  It is just too coincidental to be a move against RSD  in 
particular.
<P>
The  terms that Sky is now seeking to enforce on  its  subscribers 
are very restrictive. They do not want a subscriber to time  shift 
a  movie or any other programme. They do not want the service  fed 
to  a second television set. They want a second  subscription  for 
each  terminal.  Perhaps  this  is  Sky's  move  into  terrestrial 
television  -  they want a licence fee for each  television  in  a 
subscriber's home.
<P>
A  few sources have commented that this could be a prelude to  the 
introduction  of  Pay Per View on VideoCrypt. Such a move  by  Sky 
would  be downright suicidal. The VideoCrypt system is not  secure 
enough for Pay Per View.
<P>
There  is  a huge gaping flaw in the security. It is  possible  to 
record the scrambled video on a VCR and make a real-time recording 
of the valid key data with a PC. The valid key stream can then  be 
distributed via BBS or internet a few minutes after the  programme 
ends.
<P>
The  name of this hack is DDT or Delayed Data Transfer and  it  is 
part  of  the Omigod hack that is freely available  on  BBSes  and 
internet sites throughout Europe. While it is true that this  hack 
would  not be viable for sporting events, first run  movies  would 
easily fall prey.
<P>
The  only answer to the question will be an independently  audited 
set of subscription figures for the Sky channels.
