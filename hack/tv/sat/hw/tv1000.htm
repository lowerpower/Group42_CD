TV1000 - ECM Effective For One Month
</H1>
<HR>
<P>
It  looks like TV1000 need not have bothered with their  ECM.  The 
hackers  have already hacked the new keys. This of  course  leaves 
the planned ECMs by the TV3 channels in doubt.
<P>
If  the TV1000 keys have been hacked then it is a  certainty  that 
the  new  keys for the TV3 channels are also in the hands  of  the 
pirates.  It  did however take somewhat longer than  the  expected 
twenty days.
<P>
The  option of changing the keys on a more regular basis  remains. 
However  eventually TV1000 will run into a tricky  situation.  The 
keys  for the management data are known and therefore the  pirates 
will be able to update the cards by actually reading the new  keys 
off  the  air.  The pirate cards would probably be  based  on  the 
Battery Card with an added modem.
<P>
While  offering  pirate  TV1000  cards  for  sale  in  the  UK  is 
technically  illegal  under UK law, the  Uk  satellite  television 
press is flooded with adverts. Though some magazines have  adopted 
a  somewhat hypocritical view. They openly condemn the  cards  and 
yet pad out their magazines with adverts for pirate cards.
<P>
FilmNet  was  planning to introduce some ECMs but  apparently  has 
decided  against it after watching the TV1000  situation  develop. 
However FilmNet stated that it would introduce new smart cards  in 
June of this year. It remains to be seen if they will be using the 
France Telecom cards and the DES algorithm. In terms of  providing 
security  France  Telecom made a serious mistake in using  such  a 
well known algorithm.
