While  equipment manufacturer General Instrument claims  that  the 
Videocipher  II  data stream was shut off over a year ago,  it  is 
still being used for some services. These include regional  sports 
networks  including various feeds from Home Sports  Entertainment, 
Sports  Channel, ADC, Pacific Sports Network, and  Sunshine,  AMC, 
Nick  E, Life E&W, WWOR, MTV, Discovery E&W, VH1, CMTV, ESPN  E&W, 
CNN  W,  TBS W, WGN, CNBC W, TNT W, TNN W, USA E&W,  CHN,  A&E  W, 
Youth  (Canadian). These services are still being  transmitted  in 
VCII mode because not all cable companies have installed VCII PLUS 
decoders at their headends.
<P>
The working keys for these channels change every few days and they 
are subject to an on-going ECM (electronic countermeasure) program 
so audio is not always available for all channels.
<P>
There is software available on BBS's which allows users to receive 
audio  and  video  on these channels.  Authorized  seed  keys  are 
necessary.  The  net effect is to  clone the VCII to  the  decoder 
which is really using those keys. EPROM chips loaded with  working 
keys  are available for about $50 and they work until GI  extracts 
the  keys from them and shuts them off. The most practical way  to 
obtain audio and video for these services is by connecting a modem 
to the VCII decoder. Every few days the user can push a button  on 
his remote control to download the latest keys.
<P>
This  method has been abandoned by most individual users,  because 
the  long distance charges, hardware upgrades, and aggravation  is 
not worth the cost. There are some satellite dealers who still use 
the system for their customers.
<P>
Many  of  those who still use their VCII boards,  employ  them  to 
obtain  video-only  on  PLUS encoded  adult  channels.  There  are 
several available, ranging from softcore to XXX. They include Adam 
&  Eve, Cupid, Exxxtasy, LVTN, Network 1, Playboy, Spice 1,  Spice 
2, and TV Erotica , Video-only chips are available and EPROM files 
are available on many BBS's.
<P>
Some individuals pirate the 10 TVN PPV movie services on T3 on  an 
029  PLUS board by taking a "snapshot" of the RAM at the start  of 
the  month.  They  watch all the movies they want  to  during  the 
month,  and  then  at the end of the month they  reload  the  data 
captured  at the start of the month. When the unit is  polled  for 
PPV  purchases  it shows none so they are not billed. There  is  a 
period  of approximately 10 days at the end of the cycle  when  no 
movies  are watched. Many individuals misuse the Surewrit  9  test 
device  for  this  purpose.   We have a file  on  the  BBS  called 
Plusmap.txt for those interested in studying further.

According to RCA, the receiver must be connected to a phone  line. 
Where the deluxe system is installed, they say each receiver  must 
be connected to  the same phone line via the 1200 baud modem. (The 
unit  also  has  a 19,200 modem). The phone line is  not  used  to 
transmit  authorization  data to keep the  receiver  running.  The 
receiver calls out monthly to report what pay-per-view movies have 
been  ordered.  It is also used to verify the location  where  the 
system is installed.
<P>
Some  individuals  install the units at remote  cottages  or  RV's 
where there is no phone. In this case, DirecTV has a backup system 
so  individuals  without phones may order PPV events  manually  by 
calling their 800 number. There is a $2 charge in addition to  the 
cost of the movie for this service.
<P>
As  long as the unit is not connected to a phone line, the  system 
operators  have  no idea where it is, so it could  be  in  Canada, 
Mexico or the Caribbean. Some U.S. individuals who wish to  obtain 
local blacked out sporting events use a billing address  different 
from  where the unit is installed, for this purpose. It  is  still 
necessary to purchase the NFL, NHL, NBA, etc. package and the unit 
must be connected to a phone line.
<P>
Mail  drops  usually  advertise  under  Mail  Boxes  or  Telephone 
Answering Services.
<P>
Those  who purchase a deluxe system including a  second  receiver, 
obtain a programming discount for the second receiver. The primary 
receiver pays full price and DirecTV charges $1.95 extra and  USSB 
charges  $1  per  month for programming  received  on  the  second  
receiver.  The  second receiver receives whatever  programming  is 
subscribed to on the primary receiver.
<P>
Some  dealers split systems. They place the primary receiver in  a 
friendly  location. The secondary receiver is typically sold to  a 
Canadian.  The dealer charges the full price for  programming  but 
only has to pay $1.95 plus $1. This can amount to a profit of  $60 
per  month, every month per customer and is more  profitable  than 
VCII  piracy  was  for  many of them.  We  have  heard  that  some 
installers  have been requested to connect both receivers  to  the 
single  phone  line during authorization and that they  have  done 
that  before  splitting  them up. We have  also  heard  that  some 
individuals  have  told DirecTV during the  authorization  process 
that the primary receiver would be located at their residence  and 
the  secondary would be located at a remote cottage and they  have 
received  the discount but they are not able to order PPV  on  the 
secondary  receiver.  Some individuals are selling  a  unit  which 
intercepts  the 800 number the receiver is programmed to dial  and 
routes the call to a U.S. number where the 800 number call is then 
placed. These units will be necessary this fall when the  football 
season  begins,  at  least  for those  who  don't  have  a  pirate 
smartcard.
<P>
The  dialers being sold now cost $125 and Canadian  consumers  who 
purchase  them are unaware that hundreds of their calls are  being 
routed  through the same US phone number. It is only a  matter  of 
time  before this system is shut down. Advanced Technologies  will 
soon  market  a  system which allows the user to set  up  his  own 
network.  Another company is developing a system which allows  the 
user to manually enter the phone number being used. The only other 
problems  we have heard regarding this type of gray market  piracy 
is  when  foreigners  have ordered PPV  events  while  having  the 
receiver  connected  to  a phone line. In  some  cases  they  have 
received  mail  messages  to their  dishes  requesting  that  they 
contact DirecTV to verify that their systems are in the U.S.  Then 
they have been told that if DirecTV receives calls from a  foreign 
area  code  their programming will be discontinued.  Some  do  not 
order PPV events for this reason and others order manually.
<P>
The major news which occurred just before we went to press is that 
the RCA system has just been hacked. According to reliable sources 
a nearly six month effort on the part of a U.S.-European coalition 
has  lead to the compromise of the system. Current  plans  involve 
the  issue  of 4 tiers of pirate cards. The Blue card  will  offer 
only basic programming and will cost approximately $150. The  next 
level card will include the subscription movie channels, the  next 
level  card  will also include the sports channels  together  with 
packages  like the NFL etc. The Gold card will be a global  access 
card  which will allow access to all services and will  include  a 
limit  of $500 in PPV programming. Note that the pirates  are  now 
limiting the amount of PPV events their customers will receive. To 
prevent  the pirate card from being pirated it will employ a  kill 
routine  so  that once it is inserted into the card  slot  in  the 
receiver it may not be removed without dumping the memory.
<P>
It  will be necessary for those who engage in this type of  piracy 
to mail in their existing cards or otherwise supply their unit  ID 
in  order to provide necessary information. Each pirate card  will 
be  unique  to a specific receiver. Programming will  be  done  in 
Canada where it will ostensibly not be illegal, at least for  now. 
Three Canadian companies will essentially have franchises and will 
receive the necessary hardware/software.
<P>
Release  of the cards is expected around April, depending  on  two 
factors. The developers want to wait for the release of the series 
10  Videocrypt cards in Europe. At this time the 09 series  pirate 
cards  are being heavily ECM'd and a new release is imminent.  One 
company  supplies  the  encryption algorithms for  both  U.S.  and 
European  cards. The U.S. card is based on the 09 series  card  in 
Europe. U.S. developers don't want their card reversed and counter 
ECM'd  in the 10 series so they choose to wait. They also want  an 
installed base of about 800,000 systems to make it more costly for 
system operators to issue a new series of cards. They have said in 
interviews that it costs them up to $35/card if they have to issue 
a new series because of a breach of security.
<P>
In  the  past, we have sometimes been able to  alert  our  readers 
several months in advance to events which would transpire. When we 
have  done  that,  some  entrepreneurs  would  immediately   offer 
products  which did in fact not yet exist. This is March 11,  1995 
and there is no pirate card for the RCA system available  anywhere 
at this time nor will there be in the very near future. We will be 
allowed  to see the system somewhere offshore and we  will  report 
our  findings. Do not send money to anyone. We will have more  DBS 
news  next  time  together  with more  discussion  of  the  issues 
involved. Do not send money to anyone.
