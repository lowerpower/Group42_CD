rife.

STEPHEN BARDEN RESIGNS FROM NEWS DATACOM     26 APRIL 1995

Stephen  Barden,  Chief Executive and Managing  Director  of  News 
Datacom, has resigned.

Greg   Clark,  President,  News  Technology  Group  of  the   News 
Corporation  Limited  to  whom News Datacom  reports  said  today: 
"Stephen has contributed significantly to News Datacom and will be 
missed by management and staff alike. The current positive trading 
position  and technological strengths of News Datacom stand  as  a 
testimony to Stephen's leadership. I wish him the best of luck  in 
his future activities."

<P>
In  the  Black  Book, I have pointed out that the  worst  kind  of 
person  to put in charge of a counter-piracy program is a  lawyer. 
The  fact  that Stephen Barden trained as a lawyer  may  have  had 
something  to  do  with the rather lacklustre  results  that  News 
Datacom have had fighting piracy.
</P>
<p>
Significantly,  his  appointment and the Ho Lee Fook  occurred  at 
roughly  the same time. It was perhaps the worst baptism  of  fire 
that any managing director could have had.
</P>
<p>
The  speculation  on why Barden resigned is only  beginning.  Some 
sources seem to think that it was because Barden wanted to  expand 
News Datacom beyond the realm of BSkyB. 
</p>
<p>
The  fact that Pay Television is a big market would have  inspired 
Barden  to look at the bigger picture. Prior to his arrival,  News 
Datacom was looked upon as the card supplier for Sky. 
</P>
<p>
With the European satellite television market going though drastic 
expansion,  it  would have been a good thing to be able  to  offer 
prospective  broadcasters  a  tried  and  tested,  though   albeit 
insecure, access control system.
</P><P>
The  Sky  Multichannels  package  may  have  been  an  attempt  at 
implementing  such a plan. Of course the broadcasters that  signed 
on  for the Multichannels were less than pleased to discover  that 
the security of the 07 Sky card was non-existent.
</P><P>
Other  areas  were being explored. The VideoCrypt II  variant  was 
intended  to  provide a VideoCrypt based system for  the  mainland 
European  market. This was not as successful for News  Datacom  as 
they  had  hoped.  The  Europeans knew  about  the  insecurity  of 
VideoCrypt  and were not that keen on News Datacom's track  record 
in protecting systems.
</P><P>
It  would  have been very difficult to see how Barden  could  have 
succeeded  in protecting VideoCrypt. The stupid decisions may  not 
have  been his responsibility. His idea of expanding News  Datacom 
beyond  the BSkyB serfdom is interesting but it seemed  to  ignore 
one  fact  - the rest of the world does not see  News  Datacom  as 
being totally successful in protecting systems.
</P><P>
It  is  unlikely  that Barden will ever  seek  employment  in  Pay 
Television  security.  The  main  question  now  relates  to   his 
successor as head of News Datacom.
</P><P>
This  resignation could not have come at a more critical time  for 
News  Datacom.  The  09  Sky card is  totally  compromised  and  a 
replacement  card has to be issued soon. Perhaps as a  result  the 
new 0A card may not appear until September at the earliest.
