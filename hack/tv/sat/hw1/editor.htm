At the time, the QuickStart scheme seemed like a good thing.  Over 
the  years, it became clear that it was, in terms of  security  at 
least, a disaster. However there was a bright side in that it  did 
encourage people to subscribe at the same time as purchasing their 
satellite tv system.
</P>
<P>
The  new procedure is that the subscriber contract has to be  sent 
back to the Sky subscriber centre. It is the Sky subscriber centre 
who will issue the card to the customer.
</P>
<P>
While  it could be argued that this move makes the chain  of  card 
distribution  safer, there is another aspect. It is one more  step 
in reducing role of the Authorised Sky Agent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the commission received by the ASA dealer 
has dropped. The main concentration of Sky's marketing drive  over 
the last few years was on the larger high street chain stores.  Of 
course  this  could  be  seen as  an  attempt  to  have  satellite 
television  systems represented as a standard household  appliance 
just like a cooker or a table.
</P>
<P>
The  take  up of satellite television in the UK has  not  been  as 
rapid  as  Sky would have liked. Ireland is a  different  case  as 
about 75% of the viewing population are on cable or MMDS  systems. 
The UK is nowhere near that kind of figure so there is still  room 
for satellite television a la Sky.
</P>
<P>
In  their greed, it seems that Sky's marketing  people  overlooked 
one  major  factor - the battle for the hearts and  minds  of  the 
dealers.   It  was the typical attitude of the eighties  -  greed. 
What  these  people  in  Sky seemed  to  neglect  was  that  every 
disgruntled dealers was a potential third party smart card seller.
</P>
<P>
Some  dealers did not sell third party cards but the economics  of 
the  situation  were  not so kind to others. With  the  advent  of 
Phoenix,  QuickStart cards were being sold for up to £60 each.  It 
makes a lot of sense to sell something for £60 having paid £5  for 
it.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was the cumulative loss of millions of QuickStarts that 
forced  Sky  into  suspending their  QuickStart  scheme.  But  the 
underlying motive may give some indication as to their  intentions 
for the 0A.
</P>
<P>
Considering  the number of 09 cards lost to piracy, Sky  may  have 
had no option but to suspend the QuickStart scheme. Their reserves 
of  cards would have been running low as the 0A card was  expected 
to be launched around April. 
</P>
<P>
Instead  with  the 0A card delayed until at least  September,  the 
reserves  would have to last - the best way to ensure this was  by 
stopping the QuickStart scheme.
</P>
<H3>Changes At News Datacom</H3>
<P>
The resignation of Stephen Barden as head of News Datacom came  as 
a surprise. The surprise being that he lasted in that position for 
so long.
</P>
<P>
The Ho Lee Fook hack, the assorted Season, the 09 hacks took place 
while he was in charge. Basically put he was probably very good at 
conducting  the business affairs of News Datacom but  was  totally 
out of his depth with counter piracy operations.
</P>
<P>
It  seems that his tenure was unfortunate enough to be  pockmarked 
with piracy. It was a threat that his background was  unaccustomed 
to handling. It seems that he was both a lawyer and a  sociologist 
-  the  worst  possible backgrounds for  someone  working  in  the 
Blackbox industry.
</P>
<P> 
He  did not seem to have any great appreciation of the  technology 
nor  those involved with it. But on the plus side he was  probably 
responsible for giving News Datacom a stranglehold on the  English 
language pay television market in Europe.
