Hack On Nagra Syster?
</h1>
<hr>
<p>
There  are  some  rumours that the Nagra Syster  system  has  been 
hacked.  This hack, it appears, is based on a pirated  smart  card 
approach.
</P>
<P>
If true, this will be the first valid hack on the Syster system in 
over  four years. This track record seems to unusual in  terms  of 
European piracy.
</P>
<P>
The  main  problem however is that there is a  clear  shortage  of 
Syster decoders in which to place this rumoured pirate smart card. 
Reverse-engineering  the decoder would be a very expensive  option 
and  a clone of the official decoder would probably make the  hack 
economically non-viable.
</P>
<P>
The  wild  card  in  all this is Spain. Canal  Plus  Spain  is  in 
operation  with the Syster decoders. The possibility  exists  that 
there will be a supply of "missing" official decoders making their 
way into Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Other Grey Market options are beginning to appear. Official Syster 
decoders,  complete  with subscriptions are  being  advertised  in 
satellite television magazines.
