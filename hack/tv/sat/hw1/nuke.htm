<H1>Tactical Release Of Code Nukes Sky</H1>
<P>
The  source code for the 09 Sky card algorithms and keys has  been 
released.  It is now available on the Internet and also on UK  and 
European Bulletin Board Systems.
 </P><P>
A  full working version of the 09 code was released as part  of  a 
file  on  how  to  build a pirate  smart  card.  The  file,  named 
SKY09PUB.ZIP,  was described as "The Big Publication".  The  code, 
written in C and assembly language now gives everyone the software 
tools  to build their own card. It also provides an view into  the 
operation of the Sky card.
</P><P>
The  slide  to catastrophe began on Christmas Eve  1994  when  the 
first  09  Omigod program was released. Within a few  hours  there 
was a number of variations. The title for the story in Hack  Watch 
News was "Sky Scrooged". Though in some respects the situation  is 
similar  to the release of the 07 code last year, there  are  some 
fundamental differences.
</P><P>
When  the 07 code was released as part of the SEASON/OMIGOD  hack, 
Sky  had  the  09 cards in position. The  07  SEASON  program  was 
launched in March 1994 but Sky had been issuing the 09 cards since 
February  of  that year. The lifetime of the 07  SEASON  hack  was 
roughly two months. It could be argued that the 07 SEASON hack was 
living on borrowed time.
</P><P>
This release, however, is very different. Sky does not have the 0A 
cards  in position. As a result, they can only respond to this  by 
implementing further Electronic Countermeasures, (ECMs), on  their 
present  card. Since the actual code is now public knowledge,  the 
effectiveness of these ECMs is severely limited.
</P><P>
To  date,  all  of the upgrades for the pirate  cards  and  SEASON 
programs have been trickled down. When an ECM was implemented,  it 
took  a few hours for the ECM to be examined and the cards  to  be 
updated.  The  SEASON hacks were generally updated  within  twenty 
four hours or so. This time lag benefited Sky. They could at least 
claim that their ECMs were successful, however briefly.
</P><P>
With the public knowledge of the code, any future ECMs would be of 
limited  duration and effect. Whereas before the knowledge of  the 
algorithms was confined to a few hundred people, the number now is 
in  the  region of thousands. Considering that the code  is  being 
spread  by Internet and by Bulletin Board Systems, it  seems  that 
Sky  and  News Datacom have once more lost any  effective  control 
over their system. 
</P><P>
The computer file, being electronic information can be transmitted 
via telephone. Short of cutting all international telephone  lines 
and  internet  feeds,  there is nothing sane  that  Sky  and  News 
Datacom  can do. Of course the most obvious reaction from Sky  and 
their legal department would be to try and minimise the impact  by 
representing  the  release as being of less significance  than  it 
really is. This is called a minimalising rationalisation or a  lie 
depending on whose side you are on.
</P><P>
Sky's  requirement  for a new smart card has become all  the  more 
apparent.  According to some, the new card was expected to  be  in 
place by July 1st. Others claimed that Sky would try and ride  out 
the  storm  with their present 09 card and would only  upgrade  in 
September.  In  old piracy terms, Sky have been  holed  below  the 
water  line.  If they do not have the 0A card ready to  ship  then 
they are going to find out just what Davy Jones' locker holds.
