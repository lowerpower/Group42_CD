PICBUSTER - Details Released On Internet
</H1>
<HR>
<P>
For  a  long time, some of the most frequently asked  questions  on 
Special Projects were about Picbuster. Was it a program? Was it  a 
device? Did it really exist. The answer has been given in a Usenet 
message. It is essentially a Welsh Poet - Dai Ode. In other words, 
it is a diode.
</P><P>
The  standard method of popping a PIC was to actually  remove  the 
top  of  the chip and re-engineer the fuse. The  method  described 
opposite  is  effectively the cheapest solution. Of  course  other 
methods exist.
</P><P>
The  standard result when the fuse is reset is that  the  complete 
memory  of the PIC16C84 is reset. In the normal  programming  mode 
there  is  a  large difference  between  the  programming  voltage 
(approx  13.8  Volts)  and the supply voltage (5  Volts).  In  the 
Picbuster  as  described opposite, the recommended  difference  is 
approximately  0V5.  The voltage drop across the diode is  0V6  to 
0V7.  The 0V5 voltage differential may not be enough to reset  the 
entire memory but is enough to alllow the fuse to be reset.
</P><P>
The  publication  of this information on the Usenet  does  provide 
other  problems.  Most  of the pirate smart cards in  use  at  the 
moment are based on the PIC16C84. The widespread knowledge of  how 
to  hack  these  chips  means that the  market  can  become  over-
saturated with pirate cards.
</P><P>
To  date  the pirate cards have been upgraded  in  a  trickle-down 
manner.  A  few companies at the top of the chain figure  out  the 
fix  for the new ECM and implement it. The details of the fix  are 
then  sold  on down the chain until finally the whole  market  has 
been upgraded. In effect it is almost feudal.
</P><P>
It  would  be  easy to think that this would  benefit  the  hacked 
channels more than the pirates. That would of course be wrong. The 
net result of the publication is that the knowledge of the  system 
is  spread more widely than before. Therefore the more people  who 
understand the system, the quicker the turn around between ECM and 
fix. 
</P><P>
The  widespread availability of the knowledge to pop the  PIC16C84 
is  making some pirate card manufacturers rethink their  strategy. 
One notable change has been the Benedex - Futuretron Battery card. 
This  card  uses the Dallas Micros chip rather than one  from  the 
PIC16* series. Another option is the reprogrammed Sky 09 card (see 
separate story in this issue).
</P><P>
The  PIC16C84 is widely used. In some applications it is  used  to 
control  electronic locks such as those used on some of  the  more 
up  market cars. There was a court case in the UK last year  where 
the defendant was convicted for having in his possession a  device 
that snatched the RF data from these electronic keys and  replayed 
it  to open the locks. The use of Picbuster could be dangerous  if 
it  showed that there was a backdoor code (bad pun) that could  be 
used  by  garages  in  the  event of  the  car  owner  losing  his 
electronic key.
</P><P>
It is almost certain that Arizona Microchip have implemented  some 
sort  of modification to PIC16C84 die. This modification would  of 
course  take  some  time to filter into the market.  Most  of  the 
pirate  cards at the moment are recycling the PIC16C84 chips  from 
07  pirate cards. There have been some rumours that the  Picbuster 
does not work with some of the more recent 1995 batches.

In my opinion hte pIC16C84 is secure enough to prevent the  casual 
reading  of  protected code. I think that this  subject  has  been 
covered in other discussions in this group in the not too  distant 
past. I have many private emails from persons claiming to have had 
success  in reading data from a Code protected PIC16C84. I  myself 
am convinced that it is possible, so are many others, but each  to 
his  own.I  do not condone or encorage the  reading  of  copyright 
protested  code by unathorised persons. It is acheivable  in  many 
ways, one of which was emailed to me some time back by a satisfied 
customer:-

The  Pic  chip (PIC16C84) can in fact have it's program  and  data 
memory  read  after  the  config  fuses  have  been  set  to  code 
protection on.

Try the following:

Write some code to the chip with the code protection set to "ON".

Read back to verify that the protection has indeed come on.

Now  set  Vdd ( pin 14 ) to Vpp-0.5v,  (Programming  voltage  less 
0.5V).

Set config fuse to "OFF" and reprogram config fuse.

Now set Vdd back to normal, +5v.

Power off the programmer.

Wait 10 to 20 sec.

Power back on the programmer. (VDD at + 5V)

Read the Pic.... and hey presto, data in unprotected format should 
now be available.

by  revealing the above I hope that you are satisfied (  though  I 
doubt  it),  I will not be replying to further  questions  on  the 
subject. 

The   above  mail  has  been  reproduced  without   the   specific 
pewrmission  of the sender, however I believe that since the  mail 
was sent to me with no request for confidentiality I am within  my 
rights to display my person mail. 

The information imparted is I believe in the PUBLIC DOMAIN, I  did 
not invent or discover it myself.

I  have  used  methods SIMILAR to the above to  acheive  the  same 
result.
