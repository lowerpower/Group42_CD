New Sky Policy On QuickStarts - New Card Indication?
</H1>
<HR>
<P>
The  Quick Start scheme was, in the early days at least,  a  bonus 
for  Sky. It convinced people to subscribe on the spot and  almost 
without  reflection. It is similar in some respects to an  impulse 
purchase with a credit card.
</P><P>
Of  course  problems with the scheme quickly  surfaced.  Far  from 
being  a storm in a teacup, a typhoon developed. The  Quick  Start 
cards were being obtained with false names and addresses and being 
resold in Mainland Europe.
</P><P>
With  the advent of the Phoenix Program, the Quick Start became  a 
major  liability to Sky. Judging from the over the air traffic  of 
September,  October  and November 1994, they lost  more  cards  to 
pirated QuickStarts than to lost subscribers. 
</P>
<TT>
The  figures  shown are those for kills between the May  1994  and 
December  1994.  The sheer magnitude of the kills in  some  months 
indicates that the number of cards going missing each month was  a 
massive drain on Sky's reserve of smart cards.

The  changeover  to  09 occurred on 18th May 1994.  In  June,  the 
number  of missing QuickStart cards rose dramatically. The  months 
of  July  and  August were typically lower  due  since  television 
viewing figures fall in the Summer. By August, the Phoenix Program 
was  beginning  to hit Sky. The highest kill  figure  is  directly 
attributed  to this factor. The fall off in the Kill  figure  from 
November is due to the increasing availability and reliability  of 
the pirate 09 smart cards.   
</P><P>
The killing of approximately 2.6 Million cards, most of which were 
probably  QuickStarts,  would have used up a major part  of  Sky's 
reserve of smart cards. The 09 card was probably intended to  last 
a lot longer, except it has been totally hacked. This is one thing 
that News Datacom did not seem to expect.
</P><P>
Some  people  considered that the 09 was intended  to  last  until 
September  1994  at  least.  With  the  addition  of  MTV  to  the 
Multichannels fold, this projection was expected to change.
</P><P>
MTV   had   always  protested  at  being  included  in   the   Sky 
Multichannels package by Sky's publicity department. Recently they 
had  concluded  a  deal  to join and  announced  that  they  would 
scramble as of July 1st 1995. Naturally there were questions about 
the vulnerability of the VideoCrypt system. Did Sky offer MTV  the 
prospect of a new 0A card launch? It is an interesting theory. But 
it would have been dangerous for Sky to launch the 0A just now.
</P><P>
The  present 09 smart card has been reverse engineered. While  the 
reverse  engineering  operation may have taken some time,  it  was 
aided  by  the rather stupid mistake of News Datacom. They  put  a 
backdoor into the software. Well it was not exactly a backdoor  in 
their eyes. It was an over the air reprogramming scheme.
</P><P>
The 09 Sky card is based on a Motorola 6805 type smart card. While 
it  is fast in terms of multiplication operations, it is not  fast 
enough  to  carry out RSA calculations of the  type  necessary  to 
protect  Pay TV signals. Indeed the whole of News  Datacom's  seed 
generation  algorithms for the last few card issues appear  to  be 
based on a hashing function.
</P><P>
To  carry out the calculations necessary for secure RSA,  a  smart 
card  chip  with  better  arithmetic  processing  power  would  be 
required. This chip will not apparently be available from Motorola 
until  at least late July. This would mean that it would be  close 
to November before Sky would have upgraded its subscriber base  to 
the new 0A cards.
</P><P>
Of  course  there  is  another  side  to  the  withdrawal  of  the 
QuickStarts.  In  the past, the launch of a new  card  was  always 
preceded  by a diminished supply of QuickStart cards. However  the 
pattern  this time is very different. What would normally  be  the 
precursor to the launch of the new Sky 0A card may well signal  an 
underlying confusion.
</P><P>
Sky  is in a very bad situation regarding the security of  the  09 
card. The card is totally hacked at this stage and so it needs  to 
be  replaced.  However it would appear that Sky did  not  plan  to 
replace  the 09 card just yet. It was, more than likely, meant  to 
be  the  transition card between the analogue VideoCrypt  and  the 
digital VideoCrypt system.
</P><P>
This transition plan, had it succeeded, would have called for  the 
09  card to last for at least 18 months and for the digital  video 
system to be in place by September 1995 at the latest. The reality 
is  that they would be extremely lucky to have the  digital  video 
system ready to ship by the first quarter of 1996.
</P><P>
The  US  Digital Satellite System developed by  News  Datacom  and 
Thomson  -  RCA needs some modification for use  here  in  Europe. 
Tests were carried out in the last few months but few details  are 
available.  News  Datacom  are  not  in  the  habit  of  willingly 
releasing such details.
</P><P>
The  other factor that will play a part is the absence of  Stephen 
Barden.  Barden  resigned as head of News Datacom.  Therefore  the 
overseeing of the transition will be left to those who worked with 
him.  Barden's  replacement  has not been named yet.  
</P><P>
It  is likely that his replacement will have little grasp  of  the 
realities  of  Counter Piracy. Such a transitional  state  in  the 
company  supplying the new card does not look good.  Therefore  it 
would be a good thing for News Datacom if the 0A was scheduled for 
release  in the fourth quarter of 1995. It would give things  some 
time to settle down.
</P><P>
However  other pressures such as Pay Per View are lurking  in  the 
background.  The advent of Pay Per View has been planned for  with 
all the fervor of an expected Second Coming. In either case nobody 
is sure exactly when this event is meant to take place.
</P><P>
The new subscriber management centre at Dumfermline in Scotland is 
a  key  player in the Sky plan. This may not  be  completed  until 
August. With Pay Per View, the capability to take the  pre-booking 
orders via telephone are important. The present subscriber centre, 
while being able to handle the current subscription management  is 
not equipped to handle PPV.
