Official Sky Cards Decode D2-MAC Channels.
</H1>
<HR>
<P>
It  is  not a pirate card. It is an official 09 Sky  card  and  it 
decodes FilmNet, TV1000 and the TV3s. In Germany this reprogrammed 
card is being marketed as the RSC - the Real Smart Card.
</P><P>
Of  course  the 09 Sky cards are not being programmed by  Sky  and 
News  Datacom to decode these channels. The pirates are  the  ones 
doing the reprogramming.
</P><P>
The  move to the 09 Sky cards by some pirates is seen as a  direct 
insult to Sky and News Datacom. But it also underlines the lack of 
security  in the PIC16C84 cards. Most of the pirate cards  in  the 
European  Blackbox  industry  are  based  on  the  PIC16C84.   The 
commonest  combination  is the PIC16C84 and the  24C65.  With  the 
release  of the Picbuster information on Usenet, the  security  of 
the PIC16C84 is seriously lacking for the pirates.
</P><P>
The  09  Sky  card does offer a slightly  more  secure  method  of 
hacking the D2-MAC channels. The knowledge to completely reprogram 
the 09 Sky card is not in general distribution yet. However  given 
that  the  original 09 card could be popped, it is  expected  that 
these reprogrammed cards will also be popped.
</P><P>
The move to the official Sky cards by the pirates is ironic to say 
the  least. However it does provide the pirates with a huge  ready 
made supply of cards.
</P><P>
When  Sky  eventually  issue a new 0A card, there will  be  a  few 
million  old 09 cards available. The advantage here is that  there 
is  no  production involved. There are no PICs and no  EEPROMs  to 
purchase.  No  PCB  to have manufactured and populated.  It  is  a 
pirate's dream.
</P><P>
At  the moment, and probably for the next few weeks, the price  of 
these  cards  will remain high. This is due to the fact  that  the 
knowledge to reprogram the 09 Sky cards is in few hands. Once  the 
knowledge  spreads, the price of a D2-MAC Sky card should fall  to 
about £25.
</P><P>
At present this is an embarrassment for Sky. The withdrawal of the 
QuickStart scheme may have something to do with this  development. 
Though  knowing Sky's record of incompetence in Counter-Piracy  it 
is more sheer luck. The denial of an easily acquired supply of  09 
QuickStarts  would  tend to lessen the impact.  However  what  may 
occur   is  that  people  will  have  their  legitimate  09   card 
reprogrammed  for D2-MAC and be given a special offer on  a  cheap 
pirate 09 card at the same time. 
</P><P>
One  option,  when they launch the 0A card, is to  send  the  card 
killer nanocommands to all 09 cards. This could only be done after 
people have received their new cards. Of course they would have to 
advise  people of the switch over period and to leave the 09  card 
in  the decoder until it is killed. 
</P><P>
Another option is for every subscriber to mail the 09 card back to 
Sky  when they get the 0A card. The latter option  would  probably 
swamp  Sky's Subscriber Management Centre but it would be  a  more 
secure  method of ascertaining who is a valid subscriber,  ie  not 
using  an additional pirate card or blocker. 
</P><P>
The  main  pitfall for Sky in this option is that  many  of  their 
subscribers  who have had access to D2-MAC channels may not be  so 
keen  to  subscribe to all Sky channels. Instead Sky may  see  the 
figures for the Multichannels go up and all other premium channels 
go down.
