Special Projects BBS News Update
</h1>
<HR>
<p>
Special Projects BBS will be expanding in the next few months. The 
initial  phase  will  involve the addition of a  few  extra  phone 
lines.
</P><P>
The  extra  phone lines are necessary because the  present  single 
node is getting roughly one hundred calls per day. The  additional 
nodes will lighten this load and allow more users to get on-line.
</P><P>
The first new node that will go operational is +353-51-70300. This 
node  will  be  running on a separate computer  to  the  main  BBS 
computer. The modem on this second node will also be a Zoom V.Fast 
28k8 modem.
</P><P>
As  a  subscriber  to Hack Watch News, you are  entitled  to  full 
access  to Special Projects BBS. Full access gives you 90  minutes 
of on-line time per day and 3 MB download per day.
</P><P>
Over  the  next  few months, the BBS will be  hooking  up  to  the 
Internet.  At the moment the internet address of Special  Projects 
BBS is wizardr.ie. As a subscriber this would give you an internet 
address of your.name@wizardr.ie.
</P><P>
The  BBS will be running on UUCP connection to the Internet  until 
October. In October, a dedicated leased line will be in  position. 
This  will  allow direct internet access to the BBS. You  will  be 
able to access Special Projects BBS for the price of a local  call 
to your internet provider.
</P><P>
An  experimental FTP site will be on-line at weekends  only.  This 
service will be strictly experimental and will probably be  stable 
in late July. The IP address will be published in a future issue.
</P><P>
The  FidoNet echomail area SATELLITE has been taken over by a  new 
moderator.  The new moderator, one Philip Crookes, has ruled  that 
all discussion of hacking/scrambling systems is now off topic.  He 
was not elected but gained the moderatorship in a sneaky manner.
</P><P>
This is clearly a move against free speech and has disgusted  many 
long  term users of the echo. Other long term users were  becoming 
irritated by the amount of Season/MacAccess questions being asked.
</P><P>
According  to  the posts in the echo, Crookes is  apparently  some 
form of journalist. This makes his moves against freedom of speech 
all  the  more  strange. He can't be much of a  journalist  if  he 
doesn't believe in the freedom of speech!
