<h2>Alt.Satellite.Tv.Crypt FAQ</h2>
<i>Thanks to Dr. Darrell Reed</i><p>

<hr>

<pre>I notice that copies of older versions of this document are held on
various web pages without my permission being sought, please ask first.
It's polite.

I have no connection with any of the PCB designs, programs, or the sale of
any of the items described in the following document. Nor do I use these
programs - NOR WILL I SUPPLY ANYONE WITH SAID THINGS. I merely hope to
stem the flow of questions on this subject and the number of irratable
replies.

That said I do own an I-Card (thanks to Colin and Dieter) before anyone
points this out :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you've heard about "Season" or at the least you've heard that it's
possible to use your computer to decode encrypted satellite tv broadcasts.
This FAQ should inform you about what is and isn't available, what to expect
and what is available pirate card wise.

First up BSkyB and those channels that use their subscriber management scheme
are _not_ available by any direct method other than an official paid up
subscription at the moment. The recent change to a new smartcard has rendered
all "hacks" obsolete.

If you continue reading I'll describe the various Pirate Cards on the market
up until the introduction of the new BSkyB card. This will then be followed
by a waffle about "Season" or PC/Decoder solutions. Bear in mind there is
_no_ working code for any BSkyB transmission as you read this.

NB At the moment there are valid cards and software available for most of the
D2MAC/Eurocrypt 'M' channels.

--------------------------Section 1 - Cards ------------------------------

Righto! Stand alone solutions to the decrypting of BSkyB broadcasts
outside of the UK are preferable to the PC<>Decoder solution covered in
section 2 for the obvious reason that they are more convenient. However
building and maintaining one costs much more and buying one is obviously
even more expensive.

The following list details those cards known to be available by me. There
may well be others.

(a) The `I-Card'

Probably THE clone-card project. Details of this are widely available on
the net. `Shadowhunter' has even set up a WWW page to support the project.

http://www.uni-muenster.de/WiWi/home/~teschne/i-card_e.html

Briefly this card costs between DM 80-150 depending on whether you build
it yourself from scratch (80), by buying the kit from Teltronik (102, see
later) or by buying a ready built card from Marko Ingold (150).

Dieter Schiel, the designer of the card, has recently instituted a
registration fee for the software that accompanies the card. From
December '95 all updates will come in 2 forms; one free one with an on-
screen message and one without which cost a one-off payment of DM 50. The
I-card software allows the decryption of all the Videocrypt 1 (and
Videocrypt 1/2) channels when available and, from version 2.20, the 9
D2Mac/Eurocrypt channels listed at the end of this section.

Technically, this is the most difficult to build as it is a double-sided
PCB with 100% SMD. It consists of an 80c32 processor, EPROM, EEPROM, RS232
interface (to allow it to function with "Season"-type software) and 8K of
SRAM. A recent addition to this project is the ISP sub-system which allows
the use of an NVRAM instead of an EPROM. This enables easier and cheaper
programming.

(b) LudiCard - named after the designer by the designer :-) Ludwig Catta
released his design onto the (German) FidoNet under the clear understanding
that it was not to be used commercially. He suggested a maximum price of
DM 50 for anyone making such a device for someone without the technical
ability to produce their own. Of course since then it has been made
available commercially and it does cost more (DM 70 + P&P = DM 82?).

This card is the simplest of all stand-alone cards and consists of just 3
main IC's; an 80c31 uP, a latch (74HC573) and an EPROM. Software is
provided from an anonymous source and is called Decrypt.

Recently Ludwig has released two newer projects into the public domain. The
first being the "Ludiflap" which is a device that will program Flash ROMs
and the second is a smartcard that uses either an 89c52 or a 51 + Flash ROM.
This negates the need for an EPROM programmer.

(c) Flashcard - This is a wholly commercial development of the first
Ludicard. Whilst a circuit diagram is available, as yet there is no PCB
layout and one wouldn't be much use as the 80c31 uP variant used on the
card has a protected portion of code that controls the read/write functions
of the Flash RAM.

This card is effectively the same as the Ludicard with the addition of an
RS232 interface to allow working as a "Season"  between updates (or for
Maccess). The major difference is the replacing of the EPROM with a Flash-
ROM. The former needs to be `blown' (programmed) with an EPROM blower
which costs in the region of ukp80-100 to buy whereas the later can be
programmed directly by a PC. The cost is at the moment DM 150 with
software updates guaranteed free of charge.

Whilst this set-up does have the possibilty of being utilised for D2MAC/
Eurocrypt decryption it is unlikely that the suppliers can engineer their
own software for this.

(D) Battery Card - This is a totally commercial design not seen on the
net. I myself have not seen one and therefore cannot comment on the design
except to say it is based on a Dallas FP5002 uP which is apparently a
secure 80c32. They can decode all the BSkyB channels.
The cost is generally around the DM 400 mark and they mave been
successfully updated within hours of new ECM'S (or so it seems). Updates
are done by "typing" in groups of digits on a tiny touchpad that is part
of the card.

So far no news as to if and when this card can be used with any future
BSkyB "hack".

(e) Omega Card - This card would appear to consist of a Dallas Micro (FP5002),
two SRAM chips and a battery as the above battery. However this has no touch
pad but does reputedly decrypt just about everything (except TV2 Norge
- just my luck!). A 20K binary file is available on various German BBS's
that claims to be the operating binary code (OMEGA90.BIN) but without the
uP keys it is apparently useless.

Again no news as yet about future use with BSkyB.

(f) MegaMac Card - Same as above but with a keypad and very sophisticated by
all accounts! Capable of decrypting just about everything (except the
Norwegian re-broadcasts of SVT 1/2). They are currently (1/11/95) quoting the
second week in December as their target date for a BSkyB series 10 card hack.
We will see :-)

(g)PIC cards - There are several varieties of these.
  - PIC16c57 - One chip card used to decrypt Filmnet +, TV1000, TV3 and
               FilmMax. Generally the OTP version was used and is hence
               `throwaway'. The latest code on the net fails to decrypt
               anything other than the CTV package.
  - PIC16c84 - (a) Adult card - Decrypts TAC/Eurotica, Updateable,software
                                generally available (Neurotic.zip)
               (b) 7 Channel Card - Decrypts Filmnet +, Filmnet TCMC,
                                    TV1000, TV1000 Cinema, and 3xTV3
                                    software available (D2M1CHIP.ARJ).
  -2xPIC16c84- Same as (b) above except plus Canal+ & Cine Cinemas
               and BBC Prime (File MAC1095.arj)

(g)Rewritten BSkyB Series 9 Cards - There is the possibility of
   reprogramming still functioning (ie not displaying "Your card is
   invalid") Sky series 9 cards to decrypt the usual 9 D2Mac/Eurocrypt
   channels + BBC Prime.

The "9 channels" are Filmnet +, Filmnet TCMC, 3xTV3, TV1000, TV1000 Cinema,
, Canal + (16:9), Cine Cinemas (16:9).

(h) COP cards - These manage all the 9 D2MAC channels mentioned above as
well as a variety of others. Reputedly TV2Norge, BBC Prime, the 4 other
Thor channels (although they are presently using a very simple key that just
about every pirate D2MAC card ever made can descramble) and TV Plus. The
processor used on this card is an extremely secure designed-for-the-
military type.

--------------------------Section 2 - "Season"----------------------------

q) What is 'Season'?

a) This is a generic name given to a software/simple hardware hack of
smart-card based encrypted television. One needs to build (or buy) a
simple interface 'card' to put in the videocrypt/eurocrypt decoder slot.
This is connected via cable to a serial port on a personal Computer. The
software then imitates the operation of a valid smart-card and decrypts
the broadcast. 'Season' got it's name from the author of the original
hack. He was a fan of Star Trek and wished to see the 7th Season then
showing on Sky, the software was known as Season7. By pure coincidence the
serial numbers of the sky cards at the time all began 7... Sky combated
this (and other hacks) by releasing a new card series this time with all
the serial numbers beginning with a 9. After 3 months of work this was
eventually hacked and the first versions were named season9. Now there are
a proliferation of different authors publishing different 'Seasons'.

As I write this there is no valid BSkyB "Season" and none is anticipated in
the near future.

q) 'Which channels can I decode?'

a) With 'Season' and a videocrypt decoder:- Currently just The Adult Channel
and Eurotica. If the Series 10 card is hacked one can expect all 20-odd BSkYB
channels including the more dubious midnight rubbish (TVX), The adult channel,
TV Asia (NOT Japanese TV) on Astra and Eurotica on Eutelsat II-F1.

a) With 'maccess' and a eurocrypt decoder (currently maccess v1.5a)
Filmnet + on Astra, Filmnet - The complete Movie Channel on Thor, TV1000 &
3xTV3's on Astra/Intelsat 702, Canal +/Cine Cinemas on Telecom 2a (NOT on TDF
1/2), and TV1000 Cinema on TV-Sat2/Intelsat 601.

q) 'How do I get started?'

a) Get hold of the software package (see below). The details on how to
build the interface are contained in ADAPTER.TXT, which is generally
included in the archive. If it is not, then it should be available
seperately at the same place. It's definately available at ftp.uni-
erlangen.de in directory mounts/epix/public/pub/Multimedia/VideoCrypt/
cardadapter

q) 'I'm crap at electronics, will someone sell me one?'

a)Yes, Various people sell such interfaces. My advice is 'Give it a go
yourself'. If you really must buy then expect to pay about UKP 15 (costs
less to build). Ad's are regularly placed in the alt group for suppliers
from Britain.

A source is available here in Germany. Teltronic (Wilhelm von Cleef)
provides a `kit' for DM 28,50 (~UKP13) or a bare PCB for DM 11,27
(UKP 5.00). You'll have to solder the parts on yourself of course!
(TelTronic, Grabenstr. 49, 52525 Heinsberg) 100112.2225@compuserve.com

q) 'Can you send me the newest 'Season Software' please?'

a) No, Currently there isn't one! But in any case after each code change I
get progressively more requests and, unlike some, I have to pay for my mail
transfers. Try the following:

FTP:

helvetica-gw.chnet.ch
ftp.uni-erlangen.de (mounts/epix/public/pub/Multimedia/VideoCrypt)
ftp.paranoia.com (pub/users/defiant)
ftp.ua.pt (pub/misc/satellite)

Web Sites:

www.paranoia.com/~defiant
utelscin.el.utwente.nl/vcrypt
www.gpl.net/paulmax

q) How do I get 'Season Software'?

a)To avoid being called nasty names it is probably a good move not to
post a message asking where to find said updated software but to read the
posts in this group (alt.satellite.tv.europe now and probably *.crypt in
future) and act on the info. A second possibility is to join a mailing
list (example below)

> To: season-request@helvetica.chnet.ch
> Subject:
>
> ADD myaddress@mysite
>         ___
> Bruno Amsler Zuerich Switzerland
> amsler@helvetica.chnet.ch

q) How long will it be until the new 'Season' software is out?

a) 'Season' software ended for BSkyB programming temporarily
(or permanently at worst) due to a card-change (series 10 or "0A"). The new
card codes will have to be hacked and software made available. We can expect
pirate cards to be available long before sufficient knowledge has been accrued
by those that release their effort without charge (ie Season/decrypt/i-card)
The last card-change took 3 months to hack :-(. However eurOtica and the adult
channel use different codes and have not adopted the new codes as a card-swap is
too expensive for them.

q) What is MACCESS and/or why hasn't it been updated for xxxxxxx ?

a) Maccess v1.5a emulates the smartcards required to decode the EUROCRYPT
scrambled programs as follows:- TV1000, TV1000 Cinema, three TV 3's,
Filmnet +, Filmnet TCMC, Cine Cinemas (16:9, Telecom 2A) and Canal +
(ditto). The author of previous versions (up to 1.50) of this software has
made it quite clear that (a) newer versions will NOT be made public (b)
the versions currently public were released WITHOUT his/her consent.
Release `1.51' is a hacked version of 1.42 out of Holland and is no longer
current. The same is true for `Macvis-2.zip' which is also being touted as
v.1.52.

Maccess 1.5a is available at helvetica-gw.chnet.ch and ftp.paranoia.com/
pub/users/defiant.

Software for both encryption standards is also available for the Macintosh
and videocrypt only for Atari/Amiga users (Don't ask me about it tho' !!).

If you want further info, read the FAQ again then read the posts in the
group for at least a week or so. :-)
