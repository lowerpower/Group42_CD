<P ALIGN=Center>StatMux(TM) Receives Patent
<P><HR>
<P>Compression Labs (NASDAQ/NMS:CLIX)of San Jose announced today that the
Company has been allowed a patent for its statistical multiplexing technology

called StatMux(TM), which is part of its MPEG-2 Magnitude(TM) encoder product.

Magnitude is the only MPEG-2 encoder with this capability available today

operating in a major multichannel environment .
<P>Statistical multiplexing enables broadcasters to enhance the video quality
of existing services and add more services in the same bandwidth thus vastly

improving network economics.It allows broadcasters to dynamically allocate

bandwidth among the multiplexed video channels depending on the picture

complexity.
<P>Fast-moving sporting events  demand the most bandwidth to achieve high
picture &nbsp; quality. The Magnitude encoder can borrow encoding bits from
a channel which is currently in a low motion sequence and use them where
they are needed. The net result in a broadcast system is the ability to add
20 percent more content (channels) in the same bandwidth. The technology
is ideal for digital television. It also allows cable, satellite and telephone

operators to add  additional channels and improve video at minimal cost.
<P>Magnitude is an MPEG-2 product family consisting of modular video and
audio encoders and a choice of decoders for the delivery of  entertainment
and information services over telephone, cable and  satellite networks.
<P>Magnitude complies with the worldwide standard, MPEG, an image-compression

scheme for full motion video developed by  the Moving Picture Expert Group
under the direction of the  International Standards Organization (ISO).
<P>CLI is a leading designer and manufacturer of solutions for  digital video

communications including broadcast and  videoconferencing products.

<P ALIGN=Center>HomeStar: Another Canadian DBS Startup
<P><HR>
<P>Shaw CommunicationsPresident J.R. Shaw says the company's application
for a direct to home satellite license before Canadian Radio-television and

Telecommunications Commssion regulators is a serious bid to enter what it
sees as an important new market.
<P>HomeStar is 25 percent owned by Shaw Communications, and is expected to
be profitable in about four and half years after its planned launch in September

of 1996. The operation was begun with an initial C$30 million investment,
and would be profitable by signing up some 240,000 subscribers. Homestar
will compete with Canadian cable companies.
<P>   The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commssion has
opened hearings on direct-to-home satellite service and there are two other

groups seeking licenses. The first group is Power DirecTV, owned by Power
Corp of Canada and GM Hughes Electonrics Corp. The second group is  Express
Vu, owned by Tee-Comm Electronics Inc., BCE Inc, Western International

Communications Ltd and Canadian Satellite Communications Inc. Shaw's Homestar

group also includes Videotron Groupe, Cogeco Cable Inc and several other
smaller cable companies.
<P>The Homestar service is expected to launch with 79 video services plus
35 digital audio channels. The subscriber would get a dish to receive the
signals plus a set-top box which would also allow users to pick up other
channels through cable or antenna. Subscribers will be allowed to either
purchase the equipment for around C$1,000 or rented it for about C$45 a month.

Good luck competing against DSS pirate smartcards with a raster of depressing

Canadian programming.

<P ALIGN=Center>Motorola to Supply Cable Modems
<P><HR>
<P>Motorola will supply up to 350,000 high speed modems to three major cable
TV firms by April 1996. The modems cost $500 each, making the total deal
worth $175 million. Tele-Communications Inc is buying 200,000 modems, Comcast

Corp is buying 100,000 and Time Warner Inc 50,000. Industry consultants say
that the new modems will give cable companies a large edge over telcos in

providing online and internet services. Some experts say the online industry,

which is now worth about $2 billion per year could double in size to $4 billion.
<P>The modems sit on top of personal computers, not televisions. They are
not designed for interactive TV. They will feed those PC;'s the huge data

capacities of the cable networks. For the 30 million or so Internet and online

service users in the U.S., this could be a great advantage. It could also
lure millions of new cybersurfers. The modems will be leased to users for
$10-$15 a month.
<P>Motorola's cable modems deliver 100 times the data volume of ordinary
phone modems and 25 times that of Integrated Services Data Network (ISDN)
lines which are the fastest phone lines currently found in homes. The full

potential of the high speed modems require cable upgrades.

<P ALIGN=Center>U.S.S.B. to go Public
<P><HR>
<P>United States Satellite Broadcasting Co. Inc., of St. Paul, MN says it
will offer up to 8.3 million class A common shares. The company estimated
the initial offering price at $24 a share, with proceeds expected to reach
$229.1 million, if 1.245 million additional shares are sold by underwriters
to cover any unanticipated demand.
<P>The company says it plans to use up to $80 million of the proceeds from
the offering for marketing and promotional expenses and the balance for general

corporate purposes, including debt repayment.
<P>U.S.S.B. began commercial operations in June of 1994 and it now has 525,000

paying subscribers, who receive TV programs via the DSS digital satellite
system. USSB was organized in 1981 as a subsidiary of Hubbard Broadcasting
Inc., a radio and television broadcast company. When the offering is complete,

Hubbard and its units will hold about 51 percent of USSB's outstanding capital

stock and 56 percent of its voting power, it said.

<P ALIGN=Center>NFL Gets Injunction Against 30 Buffalo-Rochester NY Area
Bars
<P><HR>

bars in the Buffalo, Rochester, NY area. The 30 were sued for showing blacked

a commercial agreement. 
<P>Most of the bars have reached a settlement with the NFL in the area of

$5-8,000 in the lawsuits and the injunction is to prevent them from showing
any more prohibited programming. The NFL is making their enforcement division
a profitable enterprise. They use the settlement money to launch more

investigations and reach more financial settlements. 
<P>According to the NFL they have also targeted offendors in Canada, Tampa
and San Diego.
