<P>We told you in our last bulletin that as soon as it was announced that
there really is a break on the DSS systems that it would leave consumers
vulnerable to the scam artists. Individuals around the country are receiving
this flyer from Test Card. It appears that those receiving the flyer
&nbsp;responded to ads in Satellite Watch News and other publications. 
<P>As we have said, this is a good time to sit back and observe. There is
no reputable mailorder source for any DSS fix at this time. I suspect there
may be in the near future. Anyone offering a DSS fix from U.S. territory
is messing with General Motors, Hughes, Thomson, and the federal government.
No one who has a fix would offer it from a mail drop in Toledo. It is even
a foolish way to perpetrate a fraud. They don't have any fix and you won't
even get anything for your $10. Don't be a Christmas present for these
guys.
