<H3>Canadians Accept DirecTV
</H3><br>The Canadian government announced its decision on December 20 that
it would award
<br>new direct to home satellite broadcast licenses to Expressvu Inc., and
Power DirecTV.
<br>An application by Homestar, led by Shaw Communications was rejected.
<br>
<br>Expressvu Inc is owned 33 percent by each of BCE Inc and Tee-Comm Electronics
<br>Inc and 19 percent by Canadian Satellite Communications Inc (Cancom) and
14 percent
<br>by WIC Western International Communications Ltd. Expressvu had already
 received
<br>Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) authority
to start
<br>broadcasting in September 1995, but the federal cabinet issued an order
requiring that all
<br>providers must be licensed, so permission was granted a second time.
<br>
<br>The second licence went to Power DirecTv Inc., which is  80 percent owned
by Power
<br>Corp of Canada. The other 20 percent is owned by Hughes Aircraft Co of
Canada, a
<br>unit of General Motors Corp's GM Hughes Electronics Corp, which owns
<br>satellite broadcaster DirecTv Inc of Los Angeles.
<br>
<br>The third would-be entrant into DTH was a Shaw-led consortium called Homestar.
Other
<br>participants in Homestar included Groupe Videotron Ltee., Cogeco Cable
Inc., Delta
<br>Cablevision, Fundy Cable Ltd . and Cable Atlantic. The commission commented
that it
<br>rejected the Homestar proposal because they did not believe it could be
implemented as
<br>proposed in view of uncertainty relating to the availablility of authorized
U.S. services via
<br>the Primestar satellite.
<br>
<br>Expressvu and Power DirecTV are obligated to maintain a predominance of
Canadian
<br>broadcasting in their program packages. Rates will not be regulated. The
commission
<br>felt that competition between the two services would keep prices down.
<br>
<H3>Hughes has its Best Year Ever
</H3><br>
<br>1995 has become Hughes Space and Communications best year ever, and it
has a backlog
<br>of $6 billion in satellite orders to start 1996 with.HSC started the
commercial
<br>communications-satellite business 30 years ago, when Early Bird was launched
on April 6,
<br>1965, for what is now INTELSAT, the International Communications Satellite
<br>Organization.  To date, Hughes satellites have logged more than 750 years
of on-orbit
<br>service while maintaining a satellite reliability record of  99 percent.

<H3>Sports Bars Order Oak Orion Decoders
</H3><br>
<br>Sports bars are finding that Oak decoders, which are plentiful and cheap
,fill a need for
<br>sports programming since they work on a 24 hour sports channel. They also
receive
<br>many hockey games in addition to networks and movie channels.
<br>
<br>Two relatively new channels available with Oak are the Phillipino and
Chinese channels.
<br>Reception of these channels requires a different clone ID. The clone ID
of the Philipino
<br>channel was recently changed. Some Canadian companies are still selling
Oaks loaded
<br>with the old ID so they do not work. A major reliable U.S. supplier is
Triangle Products.
<br>
<H3>VCII PLUS Fix Update
</H3><br>
<br>In our last update a VCII PLUS for the 029 board was being offered to
the public. There is
<br>such a fix. It is a clone. We said that there were only ever a handful
of 029 seed keys. We
<br>have now learned that some of the existing sets have now been shut off.
We also said the
<br>suppliers of this fix offered the same product in the same magazine in
1991. The suppliers
<br>have been running scams in this magazine for years and were always "unmasked"
well after
<br>the fact.
<br>
<br>We have now learned that this company is shipping video-only chips. They
are not shipping
<br>an audio/video fix which works on all channels. The release of that fix
depends on
<br>developments which are occurring now. We will update you in the January
newsletter.
<br>
<br>There was only ever one major developer of VCII products. When the VCRS
was introduced
<br>he stated that it would cost $1 million in cash to develop a fix for the
system and it might be
<br>shut off the next day. That is why there has never been a fix for the
VCRS. Recently though, after
<br>much effort, the code in the 27256 has been disassembled. We will discuss
the siginificance of this 
<br>in the January newsletter.
<br>
<H3>DirecTV to Swap Out Smartcards
</H3><br>
<br>Individuals close to the situation say that DirecTV is definitely producing
a second generation
<br>smartcard. They say it uses two micros. The current card uses one. The
current card does not
<br>have enough PROM space to permit the encryption algorithm to be changed
over-air. The
<br>second generation card does have enough PROM to allow the encrypting algorithm
to be
<br>changed over-air.
<br>
<br>We have also heard that an ECM (electronic countermeasures) program to
harass the
<br>paddleboard fix may have been developed. Certainly the master ID's of
the clones would
<br>be targeted. The pirates say that there are only 25 paddleboards per clone
master.
<br>
<br>There is some speculation that DirecTV may find a way to get DSS owners
to pay for the
<br>card upgrade themselves. In an article in Satellite Retailer in 1994 a
spokesman said that a
<br>card swap would cost the company from $5-25 times one million.
<br>
<br>We will discuss the effects of a card swap on piracy next time. Will it
end DSS piracy? No.
<br>For more information on the paddleboard fix see the previous news log.
It contains the 
<br>documentation on their paddleboard fix. It may save you a call to Trinidad.

<br>more information are included.
