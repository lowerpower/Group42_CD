<H2>Pay TV and Satellite Descrambling : The Series
</H2><H3>Volume 1: The Basics
</H3><P>This is our most popular book and it is the best existing
introduction to the subject of cable, wireless and satellite
descrambling. There are several books which cover this subject but none
provide real working circuits. Our book contains proven schematics,
theory, real working turn-ons, and bypasses for most of the cable
systems in use today. For those new to descrambling technology, this is
the book to start with. It includes a discussion of how cable companies
detect pirate decoders and how pirates circumvent that detection.$15.95
<H3>Volume 2
</H3><P>None of the information in any of these volumes is duplicated. The
latest in pay-per-view systems including the Zenith Pulse Modulation
system. Turn ons for Tocom, Oak, Scientific Atlanta, Zenith,
Spectravision, Z-TAC, Jerrold, etc. For the first time, a discussion of
BAGs (Bogus Address Generators) which are used to turn-on today's most








sophisticated cable and wireless systems. A schematic for a one chip BAG
is included. There is also a discussion about data readers which are
used to extract information from the data channel. Cable techniques used
to harass pirate descramblers.$15.95
<H3>Volume 3
</H3><P>Build a video scrambler/descrambler combo. No oddball arts are
used.More turn-ons for Jerrold, Oak, Zenith,  Sylvania, Hamlin and an
assortment of other descramber circuits. Z-Trap II eliminates the
flashing being used by many cable systems. BAGS  (bogus address
generators) are used to turn on today's most sophisticated wireless  and
cable systems including Scientific Atlanta, Zenith, and Videocipher.
Another BAG schematic is included.There is a complete discussion of data
readers which are jused to extract information from the address channel.








Thatinformation can then be used to fool the decoder into full service
mode. The text gives a very thorough explanation of how addressable
systems work.The SUN board from Dectec.$15.95
<H3>Volume 4
</H3><P>Notch filters. Data injectors are used to put cable decoders into
full service mode. Z-TAC Oak, Jerrold and SSAVI turn-ons, Test chips.
Key circuits.Programming SUN decoders. The mail order decoder from
Summit Marketing being sold in the magazines.$15.95
<H3>Volume 5
</H3><P>Compatibility of scrambling and cable ready TV receivers. The SSAVI

</H3><P>How test chips work. Bullet blockers and
stoppers. Cubes, the coolest of the pirate descramblers. A data reader
project. Another project, the pass key. DirecTV's Videocrypt system.$15.95
<H3>Volume 7
</H3><P>Volume 7 is just being written. and  we mention for the benefit of
those who want to include in one of our specials. There will be more
cable and wireless turn-ons and more technical articles on cable and
satellite hacking. It will be released in November 1995. It may be
included in any special and it will be mailed when it is released.There
is a new PLUS fix and DSS fixes to talk about as well as a new digital
cable box. Forget about pocket cubes, bullet busters, and ECM's. They
won't matter any more.$15.95
<H3>Satellite Hacker's Handbook
</H3><P>We are in the midst of a revolution in the satellite delivery of








programming. All the analogue services are going digital and there are
now digital DBS services available. This book is a guide for those
considering the purchase of a system. It includes installation and
maintenance and a complete discussion of all current methods used to
pirate satellite delivered programming.$15.95
<H3>Wireless Cable Handbook
</H3><P>Wireless cable systems exist in most major cities across the
country. They deliver programming to hotels,apartments, etc. It is
possible to intercept their signals with homebrew equipment or those
$100 systems. Includes schematics and plans for several homebuilt
systems together with tuning instructions and everything else you need
to know before investing in a system.$15.95
<H3>The Compleat Wizard
</H3><P>While the data stream for residential VCII satellite decoders has
been turned off, some satellite users are continuing to receive channels
which would otherwise be scrambled, by using the same commercial
"working keys" that are used by the cable TV companies. this involves
the use of multi-bank software employing Wizard technology. This manual
shows how hackers modify the descramble rmodules, extract data from them
and use that data to receive all programming available.$15.95
<H3>Buying Surplus Seized and Distressed Goods
</H3><P>Various Levels of Government offer their surplus for sale to the
public. The price is right and all levels of government provide regular








maintenance for their equipment so in addition to being manufactured to
higher standards it is also in good repair. Property seized by DEA,
Customs, IRS, U.S. Marshalls, State, City and County police is regularly








auctioned off or put up for bid. Sale prices average 10% of the true
value. It can cost up to $200 to get the basic information contained in
this manual.$5

world where government agents distribute viruses and anti-virus
developers hire virus writers (or work for them). Surely this is
