</H1><H2>Pirate War Causes Shut Down of DSS Battery Cards. See Some of the
News That is Important To Us at the bottom of the page. March 6.
</H2><P><HR>

<H2><IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="battery.gif" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="240">Here is a
photo of the latest version of the battery card, which is used to receive
all
programming on DirecTV and USSB including pay-per-view movies. Shown is the
top of the card. The end containing the chips, which protrudes from the
DSS receiver is now
covered with plastic in order to prevent damage from static electricity.
The 18 pin edge connector which is shown, is used to program the cards. The
contact pad which also appears on the official card is on the other side.
Three separate programming operations are required and we will discuss how
the cards are programmed in the newsletter I am writing now. 
</H2><H2>This is not a very good photo. Sorry. I took it with one of those
$100 Connectix digital cameras. The card is shown in the jaws of a vice.
There are now two suppliers of these cards. It appears that one of the principals
who was originally involved in the break on the system has gone out on his
own. The original developers said they would only produce 50,000 cards but
now the situation has changed. 50,000 pirate units against 1.3 million subscribed
units is not a huge problem, but if there get to be a few hundred thousand
pirate units out there, then DirecTV and Thomson have a problem and they
will
be forced to swap out the smartcards. Their main concern of course is the
gap between DSS systems sold or in the pipeline and the number authorized.
This will give them the number of black market units. If the average
subscriber spends $50/month for programming and there are 10,000 battery
cards out there, then programmers are losing $500,000/month in programming
fees. This is offset against the cost of providing 1.5 million new smartcards
at a cost of $8 each for a total of $12 million. As the number of battery
cards increases, the balances of costs and benefits shift so that it is in
DirecTV's interests to issue and pay for new smartcards. 
</H2><H2>Modifying a DSS IRD is easier for the consumer than the VCII was.
Consumers can easily maintain their own systems if they have basic computer
skills. Considering the new round of ECM's which started on February 29,
they may have to. Only the EEPROM in the IRD must be reprogrammed with the
clone ID.
No hardware modifications are necessary. It is not necessary to socket any
chips or do any soldering. We will show you how it is done
in the newsletter which will be mailed
the second week of March. 
</H2><H2>Scrambling News does not promote satellite or cable piracy. It is
up to the individual to obey the laws of his particular country. It is our
understanding that it is legal to use a battery card in Canada and some Caribbean
countries. We believe that it is clearly illegal to use one in the United
States.
This is not a Legal opinion.
