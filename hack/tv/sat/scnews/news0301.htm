<P>Some News as of March 1, 1996
<P>
<P>The battery cards were ECM'd (Electronic CounterMeasures) three times
on February 29, 1996 at 2 PM, 4 PM  and 6 PM. There  were two previous ECM's

which occurred on New Years Eve and Superbowl Sunday. Those ECM's involved

hiccups. All services were shut off and then turned on less than one second

later. The first time it was done, the ECM was effective in shutting off
the pirate battery cards. These cards are used to obtain all DirecTV and
USSB services including all Pay-Per-View programming. Less than 3 days later,
the developers had written new software to prevent that ECM from working
again. That file is main01.enc. When the ECM was repeated on Superbowl Sunday
it was not successful in shutting off those battery cards which were loaded
with the new software. Customers of some dealers who had not received the
updated software were shut off. It appears that a small number of paying

subscribers were also shut off by the ECM. Most did not even notice it unless

they were changing channels when the ECM was being executed. 
<P>It appears that the ECM which occurred yesterday was not a general attack
on all battery cards, but was intended to shut off specific clone IRD numbers.

Part of the strategy in marketing the pirate cards was to keep the clone/master

ratio very low in order to make it harder for DirecTV to shut off specific
unit ID's. In spite of this, certain ID's have become widely used. Those
are the ones which have been attacked. Back in the days of VideoCipher II
piracy, satellite dealers were able to pull seed keys (like an electronic
serial number) from decoder modules themselves. Then they would clone hundreds
or even thousands boxes to the same ID. If the decoder manufacturer (General

Instrument) was able to get those ID's they would be shut off. 
<P>When competition in the satellite piracy business became intense around
1989 dealers would try to steal customers from other dealers. If they could
get access to decoders modified by a competing dealer they could pull the
seed keys. Then they could turn those ID's into General Instrument to be
turned off. Suddenly a dealer would find that hundreds of his customers had
been shut off. Some would unwittingly become the new customers of dealers
who had been responsible for them being shut off. 
<P>We will post an update on this new situation as soon as we can. We will

discuss it further in American Hacker V 1.7.
