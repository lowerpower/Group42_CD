<P ALIGN=Justify>The first two shutoffs of the battery cards which are used
to receive both the audio and video of all services offered by DirecTV and

U.S.S.B.occurred on New

<IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="program.gif" ALT="Photo of battery card being reprogrammed"
WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="240">Years Eve and Superbowl Sunday. Those shutoffs were

hiccups. All services were shut off and turned back on approximately one second later. The first time this ECM (Electronic

Countermeasure) was used it was successful in shutting off the battery cards.  The ECM exploited the faster speed of the authorized cards.
They could handle the fast shutoff and turn-on while the pirate cards could
not. Less than 3 days later the developers of the cards had written
new code for the main program. It was called main01.enc. Main01 instructed the battery cards to ignore the quick shut-off
and turn-on. Mainxx is the main program in the card. It is encrypted and
it

controls the operation of the smartcard. Those who loaded the main01 program into their battery cards were uneffected by the second hiccup
ECM on Superbowl Sunday. [The photo shows a battery card being reprogrammed.One end is in the programmer

and the other end has a plastic capsule over the chips. A GE DSS unit is
in the background. There is a test clip on the EEPROM.]
<P ALIGN=Justify>Since that time there has been a split of the original

developers and one of the individuals decided to produce his own version
of the battery cardusing the proprietary software originally developed by the team. The original

3-chip battery card uses a Dallas DS5002 processor. The knocked off version
is a two-chip (2 chips on the battery card) and it uses a Dallas DS5000 with
a built-in battery and an Atmel AT89C51. The reason given for using the 5000 was that the 5002 is not common and anyone

purchasing quantities would be suspect, but there is more to it than that.
The Dallas DS5000 is not as secure as the 5002 and DirecTV was apparently
able to read the microcode in it and write a routine to shut it down. The

microcode is the operating system for the card and it is also responsible
for decryption. It is a common practice when pirates split for one to get
the other's product shut off in order to make his own look better and it
appears that is what has happened here. The original battery cards were shut
off on February 29 while the knock-offs continue to work. The knock-off cards

have an important feature which the original cards do not have. They are

self-writing. Simply insert the card in the cardslot and it will update the
24C16 EEPROM itself. It is not necessary for consumers to be involved in

programming at all. Note that the 3-chip cards will also auto-program but it can take up to 2
days. They require 2 hits.
<P>A new program has been written to turn the 3-chip cards back on. It is

main04.enc and it is available now from those who sell battery cards. We
do not carry such files on our own BBS. It replaces main03.enc which had
bugs.
Consumers will have to get their cards

re-programmed. The clone ID's were not shut off so the clone number files
still work. Note that as soon as DirecTV gets this program they will design
ECMs to turn it off. This will happen very quickly if is posted on bulletin

boards. There will probably be a cycle of shut-offs and new mainxx.enc files.
It appears that only consumers who are able to program their own cards will
be able to continue to use their 3-chip battery cards. One day last week
the 3-chip cards were being shut off every hour. 
<P>For the benefit of those in countries like Canada where it appears to
be legal to use battery cards we are doing a major article on how to program

battery cards. It appears in the newsletter which will be mailed next week.
The article includes the use of the $150 programmer being sold by Open Skies
and others and the use of our Examiner which is a do-it-yourself unit which
can easily be built for $20 worth of common parts (not included) with our

instructions, schematics software and connection point package ($49.95 +
$6 for C.O.D. Scrambling News 716-874-2088. <U>Special Deal</U> - The Examiner

and a 12 issue subscription to Scrambling News for only $69.95).
<P>On another matter, we suggest you avoid contact with the Toledo website
for reasons we will discuss at a later time.
