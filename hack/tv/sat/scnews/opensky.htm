<H3>The company which represents DirecTV in Canada has elected not to pursue
its DBS license there. It claims that it cannot compete with 300 DirecTV
channels or pirates. It appears that at least for now, it will be legal for

Canadians and those in some other countries to obtain programming. This is
not a legal opinion. 
</H3><H3>After all the pirate cards were shut off New Years Eve, the developers

did some program modifications which were available to their dealers 3 days
after the shut off. When the second ECM occurred on Superbowl Sunday, those
with the new code were not shut off. 
</H3><H3>There are some vendors of these products who are not tuned in and
their customers are still shut off. Reputable dealers provide the latest
test files by BBS or other means. Some vendors are charging their customers
for expensive programmers used to archive unit data so the IRD (Integrated

Receiver-Decoder) can be returned to stock condition. The only data which
must be archived is the IRD number. That data can be obtained by removing
the smartcard from the unit and pressing the TV/DSS button and the down arrow

simultaneously. Then click on the Test button. The unit IRD number is displayed.

That number should be saved. 
</H3><H3>There is a rumour that the original test cards have been knocked
off. We will consider the ramifications in this week's update which I will
have up by the weekend. 
</H3><H3>The following are reputable suppliers of DSS test cards and programmers.

Scrambling News has no business relationship with any of them. You alone
are responsible for your actions. It is your responsibility to know and obey
the laws of whatever country you reside in.

</H2><H3>We have a new package of schematics/software for those interested
in studying the DSS system. <U>The EXAMINER : $49.95</U> is for those who
want to be able to examine and edit the 24LC16. The parts to build it cost
about $20. Mail order sources are included. No exotic parts. A programmer
is not necessary to simply archive unit ID data. That can be done without

equipment. <EM>See above.</EM> In case of an accident or malfunction it is

necessary to have unit IRD information in order to return the unit to the

condition it was in when it was purchased. The IRD number is the only data
which must be archived. We note that someone is selling a pre-built unit
for $1000. <U>The EXAMINER $49.95</U> includes shipping. Add $5 for shipment
to Canada.The examiner allows the owner of a batterycard to program both the card and
the EEPROM himself. The parts are worth about $20 and the unit compares to
those selling for $15-$250. Schematics and connection points are included.
Note that we have combined the two packages we were selling into one lower
cost package. If you paid for both, we have sent you a refund with your order.

<H1>We will discuss the use of these packages in the next newsletter. If
you are not familiar with programmers you can save yourself problems by getting
a unit like the one offered by Open Skies.
