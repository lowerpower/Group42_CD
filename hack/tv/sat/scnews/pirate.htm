</H1></H1><P><HR>
<H2>Introduction
</H2><P>This source in Trinidad is offering the paddleboard style fix which
we described in the DBS update which is on this site. Please read it. It
is accurate. The fix is a clone. That means that the programming in the DSS
receiver is modified so that it behaves just like the clone master does.
It responds to all DSS global commands as well as commands sent to the specific
clone master. Those selling this fix claim that no more than 25 units are
cloned to a given master. We have heard that some units have already been
shut down and that some unscrupulous suppliers are selling a beta test version
which does not work. This is the 30% failure rate we advised you of in our
article. We suspect that those in countries which do not have programming
relationships with DirecTV can use this fix, if their local laws permit reception
of foreign programming. That is not a legal opinion. 
<P>Our intent in providing this information is to prevent you from being
ripped-off &nbsp;by the many con artists who prey on uninformed individuals
when a break in a system occurs. An example is the offer from Test Card of
Toledo. You will find their bogus offer on another page at this site. We
regret to say that N&amp;V magazine is a major source of scam advertisers.
N&amp;V is a major hacker resource and there are legitimate offers there,
but those offering DSS information packages to avoid PPV charges, etc. are
frauds. You will always get more factual information free at this site than
you will get from these people for your hard earned dollars. 
<P>Scrambling News is not a new business which exists to profit from the
DSS break. We have been around since the break on VCII in '86, the breaks
on Oak Orion, Z-Tac and many others. We do not rise or fall based on DSS.
We have no affiliation with any other company and we do not endorse any product
which can be used in an illegal manner. Here is the advertisement from the
people in Trinidad. &nbsp;What they are selling is real. The January issue
of our hardcopy newsletter has a review of the actual performance of the
paddleboard and programmer. Scrambling News does not endorse the following.
It is provided for your information only.
<P>Scrambling News has reason to believe that the rumours about a swapout
of the DSS smartcards is true. This may happen any time in the first quarter
of 1996. The technology behind the paddleboard permits it to be updated.
[See our news log 12/28 and later].
<P>We have prepared a package for DSS experimenters. It consists of a schematic
for a reader/writer for the 24LS16 and software. The parts used are commonly
available and cost about $15. Note that this package only supports the RCA.
You may archive box data in case of an accident so you can return the unit
to the way it was before you started to play with it. This eliminates the
need for the $250 programmer. Our package is only $39.95.

<H1 ALIGN=Center>The Magic Card
</H1><P><HR>
<H3>What is the Magic Card?
</H3><P>The Magic Card is an electronic replacement for the Access Card used
in
the DSS units. It consists of a thin PC board with a battery on one side,
2 surface mount microprocessrs and a 256k Static Ram on the other.
<H3>What Will the Card Get?
</H3><P>This card will fully test the video and the audio on all channels
on the
DSS units including the 100 block PPV channels. The only question might be
the PPV's in the 900 block. One known problem experienced on some channels
is when the Macrovision anti-tape feature is activated. This has no effect
when connected normally to a TV or monitor , however if the unit runs through
a VCR or you try to tape a program, you will experience periodic brightness
changes on some channels. This is corrected with a "tape clarifier" or similarly
named device which blanks out the Macrovision artifacts in the video signal.

<H3>What is Necessary to make the Magic Card work?
</H3><P>It will be necessary to interface the Card with the DSS unit and
this
is done by reprogramming the data in the 24LC16 in the DSS unit. This data
is supplied with the Magic Card. This data is entered with a special
Reader/Writer Programmer included in the dealer package. This programmer
also has a function used to capture and store the original data. (necessary
to bring the unit back to stock).
<H3>Can the Card go down?
</H3><P>Anything is possible. The Magic Card is a clone. If the clone goes
down,
so does your unit. The Magic Card can be reconfigured, meaning you will return
the card to your dealer and it can be reprogrammed with the new data. 
<P><I><U>This unit is for use outside the U.S. The user of this product must
abide with the laws of his Country and State. </U></I>
