this program deals with the ecm on 15th June 1995. it doesn't really fix it, but it shows you that you can allways get the right
answer code by simply testing out the values from 0x00 to 0xff for the comtents of the smart card memory at 0xe7. there also appears
to be no obvious relation between the given value (eedta) and that one you have to place into 0xe7 to come to the right answer
string. You have to make some changes to your season source code/project to
get this demonstration to work. I assume you are using the season95
source code. Further details inside zip file, this is a C code program, so anyone not interested in C code don't download this.
