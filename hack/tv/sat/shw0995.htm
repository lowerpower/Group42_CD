DSS Update
</H2>
<P>
Since  the  publication  of  the  articles  in  "Electronics  Now" 
magazine  in the United States, there has been a lot of  confusion 
as to the state of play. There are at least two different types of 
hacks being spoken about. The first and most obvious is the pirate 
smart  card  but  the second is a less obvious  and  perhaps  more 
dangerous hack.
<P>
The  format of the second hack is a card reactivator. This  device 
will  turn  deactivated DSS cards back on. It  may  also  activate 
virgin cards. In this respect it is more difficult to estimate the damage due 
to piracy. Existing subscribers to the minimum tier could use such a device to
activate all levels on their smart card.
<P>
The  "Electronics  Now"  articles  did  apparently  ruffle  a  few 
feathers, or to quote Satellite Retailer, "blow a few fuses".  The 
article in Satellite Retailer was by Peter J.Brown and dealt  with 
the  prospects for DSS. Some interesting figures were quoted,  the 
ones relating to DSS IRDs in Canada were especially so.
<P>
The figure of DSS IRDs in Canada was put conservatively at  50,000 
units  though  the more realistic figure was 100,000. That  is  no 
small  figure  when  the   number of  active  DSS  subscribers  is 
approximately  a  million. As soon as a Canadian  subscription  is 
identified, the card is deactivated over the air.
<P>
Apparently the DBS establishment in the US was contacted about the 
piracy  issue  by  Mr Brown. He describes  them  as  displaying  a 
surprising degree of confidence and sprinkling their conversations 
with  technobabble. The exact quote is "tantalizing references  to 
new  technologies  and  new  tactical  approaches  that  were  not 
revealed  or  even  necessary when early  European  DBS  outbreaks 
surfaced."
<P>
The  quotation  above reveals that the News  Datacom  brainwashing 
techniques  have  found  fertile  ground in  the  minds  of  these 
executives. The whole idea that these characters seem to have that 
the  piracy in European DBS was early shows how stupidly  ignorant 
they must be.
<P>
The DBS piracy referred to is the piracy of the 09 Sky card.  This 
card  has  been reverse-engineered and now can  be  electronically 
dumped  in  about  thirteen minutes with a  personal  computer,  a 
program  that  can  be found on many BBSes  and  a  $10  interface 
circuit.
<P>
The  DSS system was launched at the same time as the 09  Sky  card 
was  being activated. Therefore it is more than probable that  the 
DSS card ROM and the Sky 09 card ROM are identical. The only major 
differences would be in the EEPROM.
<P>
This is not mere speculation. Sky has apparently been short of  09 
Sky  cards  and earlier this year had to withdraw  the  QuickStart 
scheme  in order to maintain sufficient stock levels to cope  with 
new subscribers.
<P>
As  the  stock levels have dwindled, they were  forced  to  either 
prematurely  go  for  an 0A (next card issue) launch  or  seek  an 
interim  supply of smart cards. The interim supply of smart  cards 
just happened to have pads configured in an oval shape. This shape 
would indicate the cards were probably manufactured by Philips but 
there is something more incriminating.
<P>
The 09 Sky cards being issued to new subscribers have some  rather 
strange  blacked  out  areas  on  areas  of  the  card  that  were 
previously white. Scratching away this black ink reveals this card 
to be a DSS smart card.
<P>
The  ROM  of the DSS card and the ROM of the Sky 09 card  must  be 
significantly similar. This fact should scare the Hell out of  the 
DSS  executives who so blithely dismissed piracy on their  system. 
At  the  best,  hackers in the US will  not  have  to  modify  the 
Season/OMIGOD  programs  to monitor the dataflow between  the  DSS 
smart card and the IRD. The packet and datastructures may well  be 
the same as the VideoCrypt system used here in Europe. There are a 
few packet codes that have not seen use here in Europe. These ones 
are probably used for the modem update for PPV in the DSS model.

Datacard - A Hack On DSS?
</H2>
<P>
In some senses, this is like a flashback to this time last year in 
Europe.  A  decent hack on the Sky 09 Card was about a  month  and 
half  away. The Phoenix program's routines were being adapted  and 
incorporated into PIC16C84s so that Sky QuickStart cards could  be 
activated  or reactivated. For Europeans this hack is  a  familiar 
one. But then the common factor is News Datacom. They provided the 
access control architecture in both systems.
<P>
The  current DSS Hack rumours deal with a Genesis  Blocker  device 
for DSS. The device, known as "Datacard" is supposed to record the 
activation  data  for the smart card and store this data  in  RAM. 
Then when the card is switched off, the device will reactivate the 
card.
<P>
The  Datacard  device is inserted into the DSS IRD and  the  smart 
card is then inserted into a smart card socket on the Datacard. It 
is not yet known what kind of microcontroller that the Datacard is 
using but it probably will not be the PIC16C84. 
<P>
Though  most  of  the European Sky 09 Gemini /  Genesis  code  was 
written for this microcontroller, it would be extremely foolish to 
use  it.  The PIC16C84 microcontroller protection can  be  removed  
with  using a diode. This would mean that the code for the  device 
would  spread  like wildfire and would be on BBSes and  FTP  sites 
with in a few hours.
<P>
As  of  this time, the reports have been anything but  clear.  The 
status  of this device is not known. It does,  however,  represent 
the first clear indication that there is a potentially  marketable 
hack in waiting.
<P>
The market for this hack would not initially be the United States. 
The forces arrayed against piracy there are terrifying to say  the 
least.  The real market for this product would be  Canada,  Mexico 
and the Caribbean Islands. These are the areas in which officially 
there are supposed to be no DSS subscribers. 
<P>
The problem with this is that the there may be as many as  100,000 
DSS  installations in Canada alone. As soon as the  US  subscriber 
centre  determines  that a subscriber is not based in  the  United 
States  it will kill the card. Reactivating these cards  with  the 
Datacard or even blocking the card termination instructions  would 
significantly  damage the DSS system and perhaps even force a  new 
smart card issue.
