          VC II+ DIAGNOSTIC DATA (OSD Screen notation V1.07)


About this file:  It consists of 4 parts.  Starting out with a
simple representation of the On Screen Display using letters of the
alphabet, then progressing to more information.  Part 4 includes
portions of the first 3 parts in an effort to have as much information
handy in one place when trying to figure out what YOUR OSD is showing
you.  Firmware versions newer than V1.07 (circa 1990) will have a
somewhat different layout, but most of the info is still correct.

Hope you find this file of use.  It's taken many hours to get it in
shape.  If you know any of the "Unknown" fields, find errors, or
can expand on any of the data, please send the info to:

Line 6 displays the following information:

[j]   Current Category Number
      Format: hexadecimal
      Range: 00 - FF

[k]   Current Category Sequence number.  This number increments by 1
          each month.  Since the number is derived from a decryption,
          it will be incorrect if the seed in the unit are lost.

                         unplug unit for 30 seconds and retry.        
              "-MP"  Missing Program rekey information; Possible
                     causes: 
                         tuned to a channel in a different category
                              (e.g. DBS unit on a CATV-only channel);
                         brand new unit (never authorized) that needs
                              initial authorization via an instant
                              trip message;

                         your area.
              "-PL"  Purchasable but Locked out; this program is
                         offered of IPPV but a rating impediment
                         exists.  To purchase the program or to view
                         the FREEVIEW, either raise the rating ceiling
                         (via Rating Ceiling OSD) or over-ride the
                         rating lockout (as prompted when the VIEW key
                         is pressed).
                    NOTE: rating over-ride is valid for the duration
of                       the program even if the unit tuned to another
                         channel and back again.  The only way to
                         cancel rating over-rides is to press the
                         "OFF" key on the IRD.
              "-SL"  Subscribed but Locked out; unit is subscribed to
                         this program but a rating impediment exists. 
                         To view the program either raise the rating
                         ceiling (via Rating Ceiling OSD) or over-ride
                         the rating lockout (as prompted when the VIEW
                         key is pressed).
              "-NS"  No subscription, unit is not subscribed to this
channel.
              "-NI"  Not IPPV enabled; this unit is not enabled of
                         IPPV purchase.  To become enabled for IPPV
                         purchases, an IPPV account must be set up
                         with the Satellite Video Center (SVC) at 1-
                         800-5VIDEO (1-800-548-4336).
              "-TL"  To Late for Purchase; the program is nearly over
                         and is no longer available for purchase (at
                         the programmer's discretion).
              "C"    Can be bought (CANBUY); the current program is
                         offered for purchase and can be bought.
              "B"    IPPV Purchased; the current program has been
                         purchased; if the FREEVIEW is not over, the
                         purchase can be canceled by:
                         * Pressing the "VIEW" key and then pressing
                              the "ENTER" key when prompted to "Press

                         * Changing channels during the FREEVIEW.
                         NOTE: If there is no FREEVIEW portion, or if
                              the FREEVIEW is over, there is no way of

[r]   Number of good Unit Addressed messages received.  Unit Addressed
          messages are CATEGORY, REKEY (authorization message),
          PASSWORD, RESET, DESCRAMBLER POLL, or TEXT messages.

[t]   Number of Frame Count messages received by the unit.  This
          counter is a good indicator of the VideoCipher II Plus
          signal quality.  If the number is increasing rapidly, then
          signal quality is good, but this number increasing slowly or
          sporadically then the signal quality is poor.  It should
          increment by 15 every 2 seconds.
      Format: decimal
      Range: 0000 - 9999
      NOTE: Count can be zeroed out by hitting a zero on keyboard.

              1 = VC sync-24 seen, waiting for messages
              2 = fade has occurred.  Will either recover (go to 3) or
                    drop to 0
              3 = full acquired, awaiting authorization or not
                    authorized
              4 = fully authorized, subject to circular blackout and
                    rating lockout.

[v]   Current Service Selection indicates which service is currently
          selected and is being output.  Utility Data is available
          simultaneously with the VideoCipher Video/Audio service.
      Format: hexadecimal
      Values: 0 = VideoCipher Video/Audio

[w]   "*" (astrick) indicates free preview is in effect.

                         tuned to a channel in a different category
                              (e.g. DBS unit on a CATV-only channel);
                         brand new unit (never authorized) that needs
                              initial authorization via an instant

                         offered of IPPV but a rating impediment

                         the FREEVIEW, either raise the rating ceiling
                         (via Rating Ceiling OSD) or over-ride the
                         rating lockout (as prompted when the VIEW key
                         is pressed).
                    NOTE: rating over-ride is valid for the duration
                         of the program even if the unit tuned to
                         another channel and back again.  The only way
                         to cancel rating over-rides is to press the

                         To view the program either raise the rating
                         ceiling (via Rating Ceiling OSD) or over-ride
                         the rating lockout (as prompted when the VIEW
                         key is pressed).
              "-NS"  No subscription, unit is not subscribed to this
                         channel.
              "-NI"  Not IPPV enabled; this unit is not enabled of
                         IPPV purchase.  To become enabled for IPPV
                         purchases, an IPPV account must be set up
                         with the Satellite Video Center (SVC) at 1-

              "-TL"  To Late for Purchase; the program is nearly over

                         * Pressing the "VIEW" key and then pressing
                              the "ENTER" key when prompted to "Press
                              ENTER to cancel the program purchase".
                         * Changing channels during the FREEVIEW.
                         NOTE: If there is no FREEVIEW portion, or if
                              the FREEVIEW is over, there is no way of
