<H1>[8lgm]-Advisory-4.UNIX.gopher.12-Feb-1992
</H1>
<P>
<H2>PROGRAM:</H2>
<P>
<PRE>
        gopher(1)       (/usr/local/bin/gopher)
                        UMN gopher client
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>VULNERABLE OS's:</H2>
<P>
        All versions are believed to have this vulnerability.
<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION:</H2>
<P>
        Shell access can be gained from gopher(1), even when running
        in secure mode.  
<P>
<H2>IMPACT:</H2>
<P>
        gopher guest accounts are not secure.
<P>
<H2>REPEAT BY:</H2>
<P>
        This example demonstrates how to use gopher running in secure
        mode to gain access to sh.  Please do not do this unless you
        have permission.
<P>
        Create or modify a .Links file on any public gopher server,
        for example:
<P>
<pre>
Type=8
Name=I'll give you a shell
Host=;/bin/sh
Port=
Path=
</pre>
<P>
        Log into the gopher account, and access the server and
        directory containing the modified .Links file.  Select the
        "I'll give you a shell" item, and after quiting telnet the
        user has access to sh.
<P>
        It is also possible to create an entry that would not inform
        the user of a gopher client of the commands that are about to
        be executed.  It is therefore possible to leave commands on a 
        gopher server for unsuspecting users to execute.
<P>
<H2>ADVICE:</H2>
<P>
<OL>
<li> Display techinical information about a link before 
           connecting to other hosts using gopher.
<P>
<li> Consider disabling guest gopher logins in the interim.
</OL>
