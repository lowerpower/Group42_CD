</H1>
<P>
<P>
With reference to <A HREF="8lgm07.htm">[8lgm]-Advisory-7.UNIX.passwd.11-May-1994</A> released
yesterday, a few people have pointed out that the fix given is not
enough in all situations.
<P>
The problem is that passwd(1) is linked to chfn(1) and friends, and
yppasswd(1) is a copy of passwd(1).  Therefore, yppasswd(1) also needs
to be patched.  The following is now the recommended way to fix the
problem.
<P>
<P>
<h2>WORKAROUND & FIX:</H2>
<P>
<OL>
<li> Contact your vendor for a patch.
<P>
<li> Patch the passwd binary to remove the '-F' option.
</OL>
<P>
<pre>
>       # cd /bin
>       # cp passwd passwd.old; chmod 700 passwd.old
>       # adb -w - passwd
        not core file = passwd
>       /l 'F:'
        0x68de
</pre>
<P>
The above address is required in the following step:
<P>
<pre>
>       0x68de/w 0
        0x68de:         0x463a  =       0x0
        <CTRL-D>
>       # chmod 4711 /bin/passwd
>       # /bin/passwd -F /tmp/WinnersBlues
        passwd: illegal option -- F
        Usage: passwd [-l|-y] [-F file] [-afs] [-d user] [-e user]
                [-n numdays user] [-x numdays user] [user]
        #
</pre>
<P>
        Repeat the adb stage, and patch yppasswd in the same way.
        (replace 'passwd' by  'yppasswd')
<P>
        Thanks to all those who pointed that out, we apologise for
        the error!
