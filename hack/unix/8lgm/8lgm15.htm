<H2>PROGRAM:</H2>
<P>
        SunOS 4.1.x binmail(1)
<P>

<P>
<H2>PATCHID:</H2>
<P>
	Tested up to SunOS 4.x SMCC Jumbo PATCH, 94/09/13 Patchid 100224-13
<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION:</H2>
<P>
	A hole in binmail(1) allows files to be created as root.
	
<H2>IMPACT:</H2>
<P>
	Any user can become root.
<P>
<H2>REPEAT BY:</H2>
<P>
	Exploit details will not be available.
<P>
<H2>DISCUSSION:</H2>
<P>
	A flaw in binmail(1) reported to Sun by 8lgm some time ago, has not
	been fixed in the the latest patch.  (The latest patch does
	fix the tmp file and mailbox creation problems successfully).
	Using the src for binmail(1) posted to bugtraq, and the diff
	for the latest patch provided to 8lgm by Sun to verify their fix,
	we have created a secure binmail(1) for SunOS.
<P>
	However, as both the diff and source for binmail(1) are covered
	by copyright, we cannot post this fix.
<P>
	We are therefore submitting our source to Sun, who we hope can
	then supply a secure binmail(1) in the near future.
<P>
<h2>WORKAROUND & FIX:</H2>
<P>
<OL>
<li> Contact your vendor for a patch.
<P>
<li> The current patch for binmail(1) is the most secure fix
	available from Sun, so is recommended for use.  If your system
	is using a port of BSDs mail.local, we recommend continuing the
	use of this.
