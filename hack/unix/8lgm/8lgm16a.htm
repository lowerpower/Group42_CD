<H2>PROGRAM:</H2>
<P>
	sendmail(8)
<P>
<H2>UPDATE:</H2>
<P>
	After further investigation, it has been discovered that SVR4 based
	ports include sendmail(8) based on SMI code.  This code therefore
	is affected by the problem discussed in:
<P>
        <A HREF="8lgm16.htm">[8lgm]-Advisory-16.UNIX.sendmail-6-Dec-1994</A>
<P>
	Any systems running SMI sendmail(8) should follow advice given in
	this advisory, and remove any set bits on sendmail(8).
<P>
	To give more time to administrators to fix this problem, and due
	to other problems being published this week, the exploit script
	will now be posted at 00:00GMT on Monday 6th February 1995.
<P>
	To retrieve these details, send a mail containing the line:
<P>
	<KBD>send [8lgm]-Advisory-16.UNIX.sendmail-6-Dec-1994-EXPLOIT</KBD>
<P>
	to 8lgm-fileserver@bagpuss.demon.co.uk.  Requests for the script
	to be sent before this date will be directed to <KBD>/dev/null</KBD>.
<P>
<H2>FIX:</H2>
<P>
	We recommend that security conscious sites upgrade immediately
	to UCB Sendmail 8.6.9, as Suns sendmail is generally recognised
	as being broken.  Your options are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Obtain patch from your vendor.
<P>
<LI>	Build and install sendmail 8.6.9, available from:
           ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:/ucb/sendmail/sendmail.8.6.9.*
<P>
<LI>	Remove set bits from any SMI sendmail(8) binaries.
</OL>
