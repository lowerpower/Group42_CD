<P>
<H2>PROGRAM:</H2>
<P>
	<CODE>sendmail(8)</CODE>
<P>
<H2>VULNERABLE VERSIONS:</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	SunOS 4.1.*
<LI>	Sendmail v5 sources
<LI>	Potentially other vendor v5 based sendmails
</UL>
<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION:</H2>
<P>
	The method used by <CODE>sendmail</CODE> version 5 to open a control file
	is insecure.  A race condition exists whereby another process
	may obtain a control-file file descriptor, opened for write
	access.
<P>
<H2>IMPACT:</H2>
<P>
	Local users can write their own control files, and run programs
	as any user, bar <CODE>root</CODE>.  This increases chances of obtaining root
	access on the local system.
<P>
<H2>REPEAT BY:</H2>
<P>
	A program to exploit this vulnerability is available as of now.
	This program has been tested with the latest Sun patch, and should
	work on other platforms.  To obtain this program, send mail to 
	8lgm-fileserver@8lgm.org, with a line in the body of the message
	containing:-
<P>
	<CODE>SEND grabfd.c</CODE>
<P>
<H2>DISCUSSION:</H2>
<P>
	<CODE>Sendmail</CODE> v5, during execution, sets <CODE>umask(0)</CODE>, which is an insecure
	mask.  In order not to leave open control files with mode 666, 
	<CODE>sendmail</CODE> v5 uses <CODE>chmod(2)</CODE> to set a secure file mode.  However
	this is a race condition, as we can obtain an open file descriptor
	for write by opening the control file before the call to <CODE>chmod(2)</CODE>.
<P>
<H2>WORKAROUND:</H2>
<P>
	Change the mode on <CODE>/usr/spool/mqueue</CODE> to 700.  This will prevent
	normal users gaining access to the queue files directly.
<P>
<H2>FIX:</H2>
<P>
	Contact vendor for fix.
<P>
	Patch source to use a more restrictive umask.
<P>
<H2>STATUS UPDATE:</H2>
<P>
	The file:
<P>
        [8lgm]-Advisory-20.UNIX.SunOS-sendmailV5.1-Aug-1995.README
<P>
	will be created on www.8lgm.org.  This will contain updates on 
	any further versions which are found to be vulnerable, and any
	other information received pertaining to this advisory.
