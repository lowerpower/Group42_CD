		[8lgm]-Advisory-22.UNIX.syslog.2-Aug-1995
</H1>
<P>
<H2>VULNERABLE PROGRAMS:</H2>
<P>
	All programs calling <CODE>syslog(3)</CODE> with user supplied data, without 
	checking argument lengths.
<P>
<H2>KNOWN VULNERABLE PLATFORMS:</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	SunOS 4.1.*
</UL>
<P>
<H2>KNOWN SECURE PLATFORMS:</H2>
<P>
	None at present.
<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION:</H2>
<P>
	<CODE>syslog(3)</CODE> uses an internal buffer to build messages.  However
	it performs no bound checking, and relies on the caller to
	check arguments passed to it.
<P>
<H2>IMPACT:</H2>
<P>
	Local and remote users can obtain root access.
<P>
<H2>REPEAT BY:</H2>
<P>
	We have written an example exploit to overwrite <CODE>syslog(3)</CODE>'s
	internal buffer using SunOS <CODE>sendmail(8)</CODE>.  However due to the
	severity of this problem, this code will not be made available
	to anyone at this time.  Please note that the exploit was fairly
	straightforward to put together, therefore expect exploits to be
	widely available soon after the release of this advisory.
<P>
	Here is a edited sample of using a modified telnet client to
	obtain a root shell through SunOS <CODE>sendmail(8)</CODE> on a sparc
	based machine.
<P>
<PRE>
	legless[8lgm]% syslog_telnet localhost smtp
	Trying 127.0.0.1 ...
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	220 legless.8lgm.org Sendmail 4.1/SMI-4.1 ready at Sun,\
	 27 Aug 95 15:56:27 BST
	mail from: root
	250 root... Sender ok
	rcpt to: root
	250 root... Recipient ok
	data
	354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself
	^]
	syslog_telnet>
<P>
	### At this point, we provide some information to the modified
	### telnet client about the remote host.  Then sparc instructions
	### are sent over the link within the body of the message to 
	### execute a shell.
	###
	### As soon as data is finished (with .), sendmail will eventually
	### report, through <CODE>syslog(3)</CODE>, data about this message.  syslog's
	### internal buffer will be overwritten, and our supplied
	### instructions are executed.
<P>
	Hit <cr>, then .<cr>
	 
	.
	/usr/bin/id;
	uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel)
	/bin/sh: ^M: not found
	uptime;
	  3:57pm  up  1:25,  5 users,  load average: 0.11, 0.05, 0.00
	/bin/sh: ^M: not found
	exit;
	Connection closed by foreign host.
<P>
	### Here we can see that sendmail has execed a shell as root,
	### and that we can type commands.  (lines ending in ; are
	### user input through the telnet client).
	###
	### This exploit could be further expanded upon to encapsulate
	### instructions within the body of a message, which can then 
	### be mailed out to a site (ie without the necessity to connect
	### directly to the smtp port).  This may be used to bypass
	### firewalls.
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>WORKAROUNDS:</H2>
<P>
	We have two methods to ensure that <CODE>syslog(3)</CODE> can not be used in
	the above manner.
<P>
	Fix <CODE>syslog(3)</CODE>, to perform bound checking.  Shared libraries
	can be then fixed to use the new function.  Statically linked
	programs will require rebuilding.
<P>
	Alternatively, ensure all calls to <CODE>syslog(3)</CODE>, by all programs,
	check all arguments passed to <CODE>syslog(3)</CODE>.
<P>
	Ideally both of the above should be implemented.
<P>
<H2>FIX:</H2>
<P>
	Contact vendors for fixes.
<P>
<H2>STATUS UPDATE:</H2>
<P>
	The file:
<P>
        [8lgm]-Advisory-22.UNIX.syslog.2-Aug-1995.README
<P>
	will be created on www.8lgm.org.  This will contain updates on 
	any further versions which are found to be vulnerable, and any
	other information received pertaining to this advisory.
