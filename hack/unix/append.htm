<h2>Hacking With Crontab</h2>
<h4>FNF Group 42, 1988</h4>

<p>
A while back I was employed by the Computer Operations department of a major
California university. It was a simple job. I was responsible for monitoring
the nightly backup of the university's AT&T 3b5 unix machine. The 3b5 stored
all the campus's important data, primarily student records.
<p>
I was trustworthy but not entirely trusted. Although I was responsible enough
to maintain the system, run routine tests, parse data for reports, and take
the blame for any problems, I was never GIVEN root access to the 3b5.
I had to make it for myself.
<p>
The 3b5's system clock regularly executed a process called SYSBACKUP. This
process spawned a shell and ran a series of commands that needed to be run
daily (nightly). For reasons of optimization, I was allowed to experiment
with the sequence of these commands. The 3b5 was now under my control.
<p>
Because much of the 3b5's data was restricted, the process SYSBACKUP and
all processes it ran were done so with root access. Here's what I'd do:

<ul type=disc>

<li>Append a entry onto SYSBACKUP that executed a file called OPTTEST.
<p>
<li>The file OPTTEST copied SYSBACKUP to a temporary file, striping the
last entry I'd appended.
<p>
<li>OPTTEST would then do whatever I wanted it to do, with the highest
system privileges.
<p>
<li>I would make a copy of the root shell and save it in a hidden directory.
<p>
<li>When I was done, OPTTEST would copy the temporary I'd created back on
top of SYSBACKUP, adjust the time and date of SYSBACKUP, and
remove the temporary file and OPTTEST from the system.
<p>
<li>I ran the copy of the root shell to create a ficticious user once
and once only. If I ever needed, or wanted, to be root again, I'd login
to the system as the user I created and run the root shell.

</ul>

After about a year, I was finally made the admin of the 3b5. My first task
was to remove all other access to SYSBACKUP than my own...
