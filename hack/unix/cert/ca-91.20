CA-91:20                        CERT Advisory

                        /usr/ucb/rdist Vulnerability

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
received information concerning a vulnerability in /usr/ucb/rdist (the 
location of rdist may vary depending on the operating system).  This 
vulnerability is present in possibly all versions of rdist.  Vendors 
responding with patches are listed below.  Additionally, some vendors 
who do not include rdist in their operating systems are identified.  
Operating systems from vendors not listed in either of the two categories 
below will probably be affected and the CERT/CC has proposed a workaround 
for those systems.

VENDORS THAT DO NOT SHIP rdist
(Note: Even though these vendors do not ship rdist, it may have been
       added later (for example, by the system administrator).  It is 
       also possible that vendors porting one of these operating systems 
       may have added rdist.  In both cases corrective action must be taken.)

I.   Description

     A security vulnerability exists in /usr/ucb/rdist that
     can be used to gain unauthorized privileges.  Under some
     circumstances /usr/ucb/rdist can be used to create setuid
     root programs.

II.  Impact

     Any user logged into the system can gain root access.

III. Solution
        
     A.  If available, install the appropriate patch provided by
         your operating system vendor.

     B.  If no patch is available, restrict the use of /usr/ucb/rdist
         by changing the permissions on the file.

         # chmod 711 /usr/ucb/rdist
