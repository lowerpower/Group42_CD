CA-94:07                         CERT Advisory
                                 April 6, 1994
                          wuarchive ftpd Trojan Horse
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received confirmation that some copies
of the source code for the wuarchive FTP daemon (ftpd) were modified by 
an intruder, and contain a Trojan horse.

We strongly recommend that any site running the wuarchive ftpd take steps 
to immediately install version 2.3, or disable their FTP daemon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     Some copies of the source code for versions 2.2 and 2.1f of the 
     wuarchive ftpd were modified by an intruder, and contain a Trojan
     horse.  If your FTP daemon was compiled from the intruder-modified 
     source code, you are vulnerable.

     It is possible that previous versions of the source code for the server 
     were modified in a similar manner.

     If you are running the wuarchive ftpd, but not providing anonymous FTP 
     access, you are still vulnerable to this Trojan horse.


II.  Impact

     An intruder can gain root access on a host running an FTP daemon 
     that contains this Trojan horse.


III. Solution

     We strongly recommend that any site running the wuarchive ftpd (version 
     2.2 or earlier) take steps to immediately install version 2.3. 

     If you cannot install the new version in a timely manner, you should 
     disable FTP service.  It is not sufficient to disable anonymous FTP.  
     You must disable the FTP daemon. 

     Sites can obtain version 2.3 via anonymous FTP from ftp.uu.net, in the 
     "/networking/ftp/wuarchive-ftpd" directory.  We recommend that you turn
     off your FTP server until you have installed the new version.  

     Be certain to verify the checksum information to confirm that you have
     retrieved a valid copy.
