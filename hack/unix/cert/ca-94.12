CA-94:12                         CERT Advisory
                                 July 14, 1994
                           Sendmail Vulnerabilities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This advisory supersedes all previous CERT advisories about sendmail(8) for
the vendors listed below.

There are two vulnerabilities in some vendors' versions of sendmail(8).
One, in the debug option, enables local users to gain root access.  The other,
in the error message header option, enables local users to read any file on
the system.  Both vulnerabilities are known in the intruder community.

The CERT Coordination Center is in contact with vendors concerning these
vulnerabilities.  Those who have patches available are listed at the end of
this advisory. If your vendor's name is not on the list, contact the vendor
directly for information on whether their version of sendmail(8) is vulnerable
and, if so, whether a patch is available.

The list of vendors and patches is reproduced in "CA-94:12.README" file.
As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will place it,
along with any clarifications, in the README file. CERT advisories and their
associated README files are available by anonymous FTP from info.cert.org. We
encourage you to check the README files regularly for updates on advisories
that relate to your site.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

There is a problem with the debug option (-d) and/or the error message header
option (-oE) in some vendors' versions of sendmail(8).  An exploitation
script has been circulated for sendmail -d, and intruders are actively
exploiting this vulnerability.  As of the date of this advisory, we have not
received reports of the sendmail -oE vulnerability being exploited.

II.  Impact

     The sendmail -d vulnerability allows local users to gain root access.
     The sendmail -oE vulnerability allows local users to read any file on
     the system.

III. Solution

     Obtain and install the appropriate patch according to the
     instructions included with the patch.

     Below is a summary of the vendors listed in the current version of the
     CA-94:12.README file, and the status they have provided.  More complete
     information, including how to obtain patches, is provided in the
     appendix of this advisory and reproduced in the README file associated
     with this advisory. We will update the README file as we receive
     more information from vendors.


     Vendor or Source          Status
     ----------------          ------------
     Eric Allman               Versions 8.6.8 and 8.6.9 are available and not
                                 vulnerable
     Amdahl                    Not vulnerable
     Apple                     Patch available
     Berkeley Software Design  Patch available
     Convex                    OS 11.0 not vulnerable; patch available for 10.x
     Data General              Patch available
     Digital Equipment         Patch available
     Hewlett Packard           Patch available
     IBM                       Patch available
     Open Software Foundation  Patch available
     Santa Cruz Operation      Patch in progress
     Sun                       Patch available

     Note:  Some sites may find it feasible to install Eric Allman's
     sendmail 8.6.9, which is in the public domain (see the appendix for
     details). However, depending upon the currently installed sendmail
     program, switching to a different sendmail may require significant
     effort.  The site administrator may need to become familiar with the
     new program, and the site's sendmail configuration file may require
     considerable modification in order to provide existing functionality.
     In some cases, the configuration file of the site's sendmail may be
     incompatible with that of sendmail 8.6.9.

Appendix: Vendor Information
Current as of July 14, 1994
See CA-94:12.README for updated information; this file supersedes
CA-93:16a.README.

Below is information we have received from vendors who have patches available
or upcoming for the vulnerabilities described in this advisory, as well as
vendors who have confirmed that their products are not vulnerable. If your
vendor's name is not in one of these lists, contact the vendor directly for
information on whether their version of sendmail is vulnerable and, if so, the
status of patches to address the vulnerabilities.

---------------------------------------
Eric Allman

Sendmail versions 8.6.8 and 8.6.9 are not vulnerable.  The problem with -d was
fixed in sendmail 8.6.7, and -oE was fixed in sendmail 8.6.8. Even if you are
running 8.6.8, you may want to upgrade to 8.6.9 for the additional features.

Version 8.6.9 is available by anonymous FTP from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in the
directory ucb/sendmail.

        MD5 (sendmail.8.6.9.base.tar.Z) = 9bffb19116e7fdbb6ec56ccf9344895b

---------------------------------------
Amdahl

All versions of UTS 2.1 use smail rather than sendmail and are not vulnerable
to these problems.

---------------------------------------
Apple Computer, Inc.

A patch to version 3.1 of A/UX for these vulnerabilities is available by
anonymous FTP from ftp.support.apple.com or aux.support.apple.com; in each
case, a compressed, replacement version (8.6.4.1) of sendmail is in
pub/aux.patches.

Filename        sendmail.Z
BSD checksum    02992  182
SysV checksum   10129  364
MD5 checksum    df4ca82f624ee8f4404c5e979e7e3d24

Uncompress this file using compress(1) and replace the previous version
(8.6.4) in /usr/lib; be sure to kill the running sendmail and restart.

Earlier versions of A/UX are not supported by this patch.  Users of previous
versions are encouraged by Apple to update their system to A/UX 3.1 or compile
and install the version of sendmail available from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.

Customers should contact their reseller for any additional information.

Sun Microsystems, Inc.

A. Patch list

    Sun has produced patches against these vulnerabilities for the versions
    of SunOS shown below.

        4.1.1           100377-15
        4.1.2           100377-15
        4.1.3           100377-15
        4.1.3_U1        101665-02
        5.1_x86         101352-03       (Solaris x86)
        5.1             100834-11       (Solaris 2.1)
        5.2             100999-59       (Solaris 2.2)
        5.3             101318-41       (Solaris 2.3)

B. Patch notes

    1. The last security-related patch for 4.1.x sendmail was
    distributed as 100377-08 (announced 23 December 1993). Revisions
    -09 through -14 were not related to security.

    2. The 4.1.1 patch includes a version built for the sun3 architecture.

    3. The 4.1.3 version of the patch is also applicable to 4.1.3C systems.

    4. The patch listed for 4.1.3_U1 (Solaris 1.1.1) applies to both
    the A and B versions. This is currently true for all U1 patches.

    5. One of the listed patches (100834-11, for SunOS 5.1) is actually a
    jumbo  kernel patch into which sendmail was bundled. The other two SunOS
    5.x patches, and all of the 4.1.x patches, contain only sendmail fixes.
    (Sun bundled all 5.x sendmails into jumbo kernel patches earlier this
    year, but later unbundled the 5.3 and 5.2 patches in response to customer
    complaints. The 5.1 sendmail will be unbundled as well later this summer.

    6. Sun releases new patch versions frequently. For this reason, when
    requesting patches you should ask for the specified "or later" version,
    e.g., "version 11 or later of patch 100834".

    Patches can be obtained from local Sun Answer Centers and Sunsolve.
    U.S. users can contact Sun a 800-USA-4SUN.  Sun can also be reached by
    e-mail at security-alert@sun.com.
