CA-95:05                        CERT Advisory
                              February 22, 1995
                            Sendmail Vulnerabilities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This advisory supersedes all previous CERT advisories on sendmail.

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of several problems with
sendmail, one of which is widely known. The problems occur in many versions of
sendmail (see below for details).

The CERT staff recommends installing the appropriate patches immediately.  If
you cannot do so, consider using one of the alternatives described in Section
III.

As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we
will place it, along with any clarifications, in a CA-95:05.README
file. CERT advisories and their associated README files are available
by anonymous FTP from info.cert.org. We encourage you to check the
README files regularly for updates on advisories that relate to your
site.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     There is a problem in versions of sendmail that support IDENT (RFC 1413)
     functionality. This problem could allow an intruder to gain unauthorized
     access to your system remotely (that is, without having access to an
     account on the system). Systems known at this time to be affected are
     named in the Solutions section below; see the column labeled "Remote
     vul?/patch status." 

     In addition, other problems have been identified in sendmail that allow
     intruders to gain unauthorized privileges. Intruders need to have access
     to an account on your system to exploit these problems. The problems
     occur in many versions of sendmail. The final column of the table in the
     Solutions section indicates systems known at this time to be affected. 

II.  Impact

     By exploiting the vulnerabilities, intruders may be able to read any file
     on the system, overwrite or destroy files, or run programs on the system.

     The problem in IDENT's subroutines enables intruders to exploit the
     vulnerability remotely. To exploit the other vulnerabilities, intruders
     need to have access to an account on the system. 

III. Solution
     
     A. Obtain the appropriate patch from your vendor and install it according
        to the instructions included with the patch.

        Below is a summary of information we have received from vendors. More 
        details, including how to obtain patches, are in the Appendix A of this
        advisory. This information is reproduced in the CA-95:05.README file,
        which we will update periodically.

        If your vendor's name is not on this list, please contact your vendor
        directly.

     B. Install sendmail 8.6.10, which is freely available (see Appendix A
        for locations). This version fixes all the problems described in this
        advisory. Be aware that, depending upon the currently installed
        sendmail program, switching to a different sendmail may require
        significant effort (such as rewriting the sendmail.cf file.)

     C. Until you are able to install the appropriate patch or sendmail
        8.6.10, we recommend the following workarounds.
           
        1. To protect against remote attacks only:
   
           If you are running sendmail versions 8.6.6 through 8.6.9, you can
           turn off the IDENT protocol by adding the following line to the
           configuration file and then restarting sendmail:
                    
                    Orident=0

            If you have difficulty doing so, consult your documentation or
            vendor for guidance.  
            
            If you are running 8.6.5 or earlier you cannot disable IDENT in
            this way. Instead, you should upgrade to version 8.6.10.

         2. To provide limited protection against local attacks:

            Install the "sendmail wrapper" that is provided in
            Appendix B of this advisory. The wrapper is also available by
            anonymous FTP from 
            
        info.cert.org:/pub/tools/sendmail/sendmail_wrapper/sendmail_wrapper.c

Appendix A: Vendor Information

Current as of February 22, 1995
See CA-95.05.README for updated information; this file supersedes
all other sendmail README files.

Below is information we have received from vendors who have patches available
or upcoming for the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.


--------------------
Eric Allman

Sendmail version 8.6.10 is not vulnerable.  

This version is available by anonymous FTP from

 ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:/ucb/sendmail
 ftp.uu.net:/networking/mail/sendmail/UCB
 info.cert.org:/pub/tools/sendmail/sendmail.8.6.10
 ftp.cert.dfn.de:/pub/tools/net/sendmail
 ftp.auscert.org.au:/pub/coast/mirrors/ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail

In all of the above locations, the MD5 checksums are the same,

MD5 (sendmail.8.6.10.base.tar.Z) = 4ab8ac267b1eaf8d1725c14cf4b2e885
MD5 (sendmail.8.6.10.cf.tar.Z) = c70c576697bbbf047ed379a7b98633f6
MD5 (sendmail.8.6.10.misc.tar.Z) = 6212390ca0bb4b353e29521f1aab492f
MD5 (sendmail.8.6.10.patch) = 08d6f977c171ea858f1e940163212c3a
MD5 (sendmail.8.6.10.xdoc.tar.Z) = 8b2252943f365f303b6302b71ef9a841


--------------------
Apple Computer, Inc.

An upgrade to A/UX version 3.1 (and 3.1.1) for these vulnerabilities is
available. The upgrade is a replacement of the sendmail binary. It is
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.support.apple.com:

        pub/apple_sw_updates/US/Unix/A_UX/supported/3.x/sendmail/

It is also available via anonymous FTP from abs.apple.com:

        pub/abs/aws95/patches/sendmail/

In both cases the compressed binary has the following signature:

        MD5 (sendmail.Z) = 31bb15604517630f46d7444a6cfab3f1

Uncompress(1) this file and replace the existing version in /usr/lib;
be sure to preserve the hard links to /usr/ucb/newaliases and
/usr/ucb/mailq, kill the running sendmail and restart.

Earlier versions of A/UX are not supported by this patch.  Users of
previous versions are encouraged to update their system or compile 
the latest version of sendmail available from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.

Customers should contact their reseller for any additional information.

IBM Corporation

        A possible security exposure exists in the bos.obj 
        sendmail subsystem in all AIX releases.
 
        The user can cause arbitrary data to
        be written into the sendmail queue file.
        Non-privileged users can affect the delivery of mail, as well as
        run programs as other users.
        
        Workaround
 
        A. Apply the patch for this problem. The patch is available
           from software.watson.ibm.com. The files will be located in
           the /pub/aix/sendmail in compressed tar format.

           The MD5 checksum for the binary file is listed
           below, ordinary "sum" checksums follow as well.

           File            sum             MD5 Checksum

Apppendix B: Sendmail Wrapper

This wrapper can be used to improve security until you can install a vendor
patch or sendmail version 8.6.10. Note that it does not address all known
sendmail vulnerabilities.

/*
**  sendmail_wrapper.c - wrap sendmail to prevent newlines in command line
**                       and clean up the environment.
**
**  Authors:    Eric Halil, Danny Smith
**              AUSCERT
**              c/o Prentice Centre
**              The University of Queensland
**              Qld.  4072.
**              Australia
**              22-Feb-1995
**
**  Disclaimer:  The use of this program is at your own risk.  It is 
**               designed to combat a particular vulnerability, and may
**               not combat other vulnerabilities, either past or future.
**               The decision to use this program is yours, as are the
**               consequences of its use.
**
**               This program is designed to be an interim relief measure
**               until appropriate patches can be obtained from your vendor.
**
**  Installation instructions
**  =========================
**
**  1.  su to root.
**
**  2.  Determine the location of sendmail.  On SunOS and Ultrix
**      systems, it is located in the /usr/lib directory.  On BSDI
**      systems, it is located in the /usr/sbin directory.  For example
**      purposes only, /usr/lib will be used in the following instructions
**      steps.
**
**  3.  Copy the sendmail program to sendmail.real.  Change the permissions
**      on the copy of sendmail.
**
**              # cd /usr/lib
**              # cp sendmail sendmail.real
**              # chmod 0700 sendmail.real
**
**  4.  Determine the permissions, owner, and group of sendmail.  This
**      information will be used later.
**
**      For BSD users:
**              # ls -lg sendmail
**      For System V users:
**              # ls -l sendmail
**
**  5.  Edit this wrapper program and define REAL_SENDMAIL.  By default,
**      REAL_SENDMAIL is defined as "/usr/lib/sendmail.real".
**
**  6.  Compile this program in a directory other than /usr/lib.  For
**      example to use /tmp, first copy this file into /tmp.
**
**              # cd /tmp
**              # cc -O -o sendmail sendmail_wrapper.c
**
**  7.  Copy this new wrapper program into the directory containing sendmail.
**      Make sure this directory and its parent directories are protected so
**      only root is able to make changes to files in the directory.  This
**      will replace the existing sendmail.  The following steps should be
**      executed quickly.
**
**      Users will not be able to send e-mail during the time when the
**      wrapper is copied into place until the chmod command has been
**      executed.  Use the information from step #4 and set the permissions
**      owner, and group of the new sendmail.
**
**              # cp sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail
**              # cd /usr/lib
**              # chown root sendmail
**              # chmod 4511 sendmail
**
**  8.  Kill the running sendmail process and start the new sendmail.
**
**      For SunOS and Ultrix:
**              # kill -9 `head -1 /etc/sendmail.pid`
**              # /usr/lib/sendmail -bd -q1h
**
**      For BSDI:
**              # kill -9 `head -1 /var/run/sendmail.pid`
**              # /usr/sbin/sendmail -bd -q1h
**
**      For other systems, follow your vendors guidelines or use the
**      following command.  Kill the processes and start the new sendmail.
**              # ps -auxw | grep sendmail | grep -v grep
**              # kill -9 (process id numbers)
**              # ./sendmail -bd -q1h
**
**  9.  Test that mail still works.

** Version 1.1  22-Feb-1995.
