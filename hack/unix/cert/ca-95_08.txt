CA-95:08                          CERT Advisory
                                  August 17, 1995
                            Sendmail v.5 Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of a vulnerability in
sendmail version 5. Although this version is several years old, it is still 
in use. The vulnerability enables intruders to gain unauthorized privileges,
including root. We recommend installing all patches from your vendor or
moving to the current version of Eric Allman's sendmail (version 8.6.12).

The vulnerability is currently present in all versions of IDA sendmail and in
some vendors' releases of sendmail. The vendors who have reported to us are
listed in Section I.

As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will place
it in
        ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:08.README

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on
advisories that relate to your site.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     In sendmail version 5, there is a vulnerability that intruders can
     exploit to create files, append to existing files, or execute programs. 
     
     The vulnerability is currently present in all versions of IDA sendmail
     and in some vendors' releases of sendmail.

     Many vendors have previously installed upgrades or developed patches to
     address the problem; some are working on patches now. Here is a summary
     of vendors who reported to us as of the date of this advisory.  

     More details can be found in the appendix of this advisory.  
     The appendix is reproduced in CA-95:08.README, which we will update
     as we receive additional information.

     If you do not see your vendor's name or if you have questions about the
     version of sendmail at your site, please contact your vendor directly.

                                                              available soon
     Public domain:
     Users of the public domain operating systems Linux (systems using
     sendmail rather than smail), NetBSD, and FreeBSD should upgrade to
     sendmail 8.6.12. 
          
II.  Impact

     Local and remote users can create files, append to existing files or run
     programs on the system. Exploitation can lead to root access.  

III. Solution
     
     A. What to do

        IDA users: Convert to sendmail 8.6.12.

        Other users: Check the vendor information in the appendix of this
          advisory. 

          Ensure that you have kept current with upgrades and patches from
          your vendor. 

          If no patch is currently available, an alternative is to
          install sendmail 8.6.12.


     B. What you need to know about sendmail

        1. Location
           Sendmail is available by anonymous FTP from 

           ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail
           ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/sendmail/sendmail.8.6.12
           ftp://auscert.org.au/pub/mirrors/ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail 
           
           The checksums are

           MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.base.tar.Z) = 31591dfb0dacbe0a7e06147747a6ccea
           MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.cf.tar.Z) = c60becd7628fad715df8f7e13dcf3cc6

           MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.xdoc.tar.Z) = 8b2252943f365f303b6302b71ef9a841


        2. Additional security
           
           To restrict sendmail's program mailer facility, obtain
           and install the sendmail restricted shell program (smrsh)
           by Eric Allman (the original author of sendmail), following the
           directions included with the program.

           Copies of this program may be obtained via anonymous FTP from
           
             ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/smrsh 
             ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/security/smrsh

             MD5 (smrsh.c) = d4822ce7c273fc8b93c68e39ec67739c


        3. Notes on installation

           Depending upon the currently installed sendmail program, switching
           to a different sendmail may require significant effort (such as
           rewriting the sendmail.cf file.)

Appendix: Vendor Information
Current as of August 17, 1995
See CA-95.08.README for updated information

Below is information we have received from vendors about the vulnerability in
sendmail version 5. If you do not see your vendor's name below, contact the
vendor directly for information.


-------------
Eric Allman              

Sendmail 8.6.10 and later are not vulnerable. The current version is 8.6.12.
Because the current version addresses vulnerabilities that appear in earlier
versions, it is a good idea to use 8.6.12.

Sendmail is available by anonymous FTP from

   ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail
   ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/sendmail/sendmail.8.6.12
   ftp://auscert.org.au/pub/mirrors/ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail

The checksums are

    MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.base.tar.Z) = 31591dfb0dacbe0a7e06147747a6ccea
    MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.cf.tar.Z) = c60becd7628fad715df8f7e13dcf3cc6
    MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.misc.tar.Z) = 6212390ca0bb4b353e29521f1aab492f

Apple Computer, Inc.

[The following information also appeared in CERT advisory
CA-95:05, "Sendmail Vulnerabilities."]

An upgrade to A/UX version 3.1 (and 3.1.1) for these vulnerabilities is
available.  The upgrade replaces the sendmail binary with the 8.6.10
version.  It is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.support.apple.:

        pub/apple_sw_updates/US/Unix/A_UX/supported/3.x/sendmail/

It is also available via anonymous FTP from abs.apple.com:

        pub/abs/aws95/patches/sendmail/

In both cases the compressed binary has the following signature:

        MD5 (sendmail.Z) = 31bb15604517630f46d7444a6cfab3f1

Uncompress(1) this file and replace the existing version in /usr/lib;
be sure to preserve the hard links to /usr/ucb/newaliases and
/usr/ucb/mailq, kill the running sendmail and restart.

Earlier versions of A/UX are not supported by this patch.  Users of
previous versions are encouraged to update their system or compile 
the latest version of sendmail available from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.

Customers should contact their reseller for any additional information.

Silicon Graphics Inc.

On February 22, 1995, Silicon Graphics issued security advisory 19950201
addressing sendmail issues being raised at the time and previous older
version sendmail issues.   Patches are still available and as part of these
patches, sendmail version 8.6.12 is provided as standard.  At the time
of this writing here is the patch information.

**** IRIX 3.x ****

Unfortunately, Silicon Graphics Inc, no longer supports the IRIX 3.x
operating system and therefore has no patches or binaries to provide.

However, two possible actions still remain: 1) upgrade the system to a 
supported version of IRIX (see below) and then install the binary/patch
or 2) obtain the sendmail source code from anonymous FTP at 
ftp.cs.berkeley.edu and compile the program manually. 

**** IRIX 4.x ****

For the IRIX operating system version 4.x, a manually installable
binary replacement has been generated and made available via anonymous
ftp and/or your service/support provider.  The binary is sendmail.new.Z 
and is installable on all 4.x platforms.

The SGI anonymous ftp site is ftp.sgi.com (192.48.153.1).   The
binary maybe be found in the following directories on the ftp server:

        ~ftp/Security

                or

        ~ftp/Patches/4.x

                        ##### Checksums ####

Filename:                 sendmail.new.Z
Algorithm #1 (sum -r):    27178 422 sendmail.new.Z
Algorithm #2 (sum):       46012 422 sendmail.new.Z
MD5 checksum:             146DD1019673D7C2C89A78D7ACF85CF6


After obtaining the binary, it may be installed with the instructions
below:

        1) Become the root user on the system.

                % /bin/su -
                Password:
                #

        2) Stop the current mail processes.

                # /etc/init.d/mail stop

        3) Rename the current sendmail binary to a temporary 
           name.

                # mv /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail.stock
                
        4) Change permissions on the old sendmail binary so it can not
           be used anymore.

                # chmod 0400 /usr/lib/sendmail.stock

        5) Uncompress the binary.

                # uncompress /tmp/sendmail.new.Z

        6) Put the new sendmail binary into place (in the example
           here the binary was retrieved via anonymous ftp and put
           in /tmp)

                # mv /tmp/sendmail.new /usr/lib/sendmail

        7) Insure the correct permissions and ownership on the new
           sendmail.

                # chown root.sys /usr/lib/sendmail
                # chmod 4755 /usr/lib/sendmail

        8) Restart the mail system with the new sendmail binary in place.
