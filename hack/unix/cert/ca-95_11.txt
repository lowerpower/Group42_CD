CA-95:11                        CERT Advisory
                              September 19, 1995
                        Sun Sendmail -oR Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of problems with the -oR
option in sendmail. The problem is present in the version of sendmail that is
available from Sun Microsystems, Inc. in SunOS 4.1.X, including patches
100377-19 (for SunOS 4.1.3), 101665-04 (for SunOS 4.1.3_U1), and 102423-01
(for SunOS 4.1.4).

***This vulnerability is widely known and is currently being actively
   exploited by intruders.***

The CERT staff recommends installing the appropriate patches as soon as they
are available from Sun Microsystems. Alternatives are installing a wrapper
or installing sendmail version 8.6.12; see Section III for details. (Although
sendmail 8.7 recently became available, we have not yet reviewed it.)

As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will
place it in:

        ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:11.README

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on
advisories that relate to your site.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.  Description

    There is a problem with the way that the Sun Microsystems, Inc.
    version of sendmail processes the -oR option.  This problem has been
    verified as existing in the version of sendmail that is in SunOS
    4.1.X, including patches 100377-19 (for SunOS 4.1.3), 101665-04 (for
    SunOS 4.1.3_U1), and 102423-01 (for SunOS 4.1.4).

    The -oR option specifies the host, called the mail hub, to which mail
    should be forwarded when a user on a client of that hub receives
    mail.  This host can be identified with the -oR option on the command
    line as

        -oRhost_name

     or in the configuration file as:

        ORhost_name

     or by NFS mounting the /var/spool/mail directory from a file server,
     probably from the mail hub.  In this case, the host name of the file
     server is used as the forwarding host identified as host_name above. 
     All these configurations are vulnerable.

II. Impact

     By exploiting the vulnerabilities, local users may be able to
     gain unauthorized root access and subsequently read any file on the
     system, overwrite or destroy files, or run programs on the system. 
     Remote users cannot exploit this vulnerability.

III. Solutions

     A. Install a patch from Sun when it becomes available.  As of the date
        of this advisory, patches are not available to fix this problem.

     B. Install the sendmail wrapper available from

        ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail/sendmail_wrapper.c
        ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/auscert/tools/sendmail_wrapper.c

        Checksum:

          MD5 (sendmail_wrapper.c) = fb53f92b6fc539766cd69e8b08909ba1

     C. An alternative to using the patch or wrapper is to install
        sendmail 8.6.12 and the sendmail restricted shell program ("smrsh").
        (Although sendmail 8.7 recently became available, we have not yet
        reviewed it.)

        1. Install sendmail 8.6.12
           
           Sendmail is available by anonymous FTP from

         ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail
         ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/sendmail/sendmail.8.6.12
         ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/mirrors/ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail
         ftp://ftp.cert.dfn.de/pub/tools/net/sendmail

           Checksums:

           MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.base.tar.Z) = 31591dfb0dacbe0a7e06147747a6ccea
           MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.cf.tar.Z) = c60becd7628fad715df8f7e13dcf3cc6
           MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.misc.tar.Z) = 6212390ca0bb4b353e29521f1aab492f
           MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.patch) = 10961687c087ef30920b13185eef41e8
           MD5 (sendmail.8.6.12.xdoc.tar.Z) = 8b2252943f365f303b6302b71ef9a841

           A note on configuration:
           
           Depending upon the currently installed sendmail program, switching
           to a different sendmail may require significant effort, such as
           rewriting the sendmail.cf file.  We strongly recommend that if
           you change to sendmail 8.6.12, you also change to the
           configuration files that are provided with that version. 

           In addition, a paper is available to help you convert your sendmail
           configuration files from Sun's version of sendmail to one that
           works with version 8.6.12: "Converting Standard Sun Config Files to
           Sendmail Version 8" by Rick McCarty of Texas Instruments Inc.  

           This paper is included in the sendmail.8.6.12.misc.tar.Z file and
           is located in contrib/converting.sun.configs.

        2. Install the sendmail restricted shell program 

           To restrict the sendmail program mailer facility, install
           the sendmail restricted shell program (smrsh) by Eric Allman 
           (the original author of sendmail), following the directions
           included with the program. 

           Copies of this program may be obtained from

             ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/smrsh
             ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/security/smrsh

             The checksums are

             MD5 (README)  = fc4cf266288511099e44b664806a5594
             MD5 (smrsh.8) = 35aeefba9714f251a3610c7b1714e355
             MD5 (smrsh.c) = d4822ce7c273fc8b93c68e39ec67739c
