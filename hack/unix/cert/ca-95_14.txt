CA-95:14                         CERT Advisory
                               November 1, 1995
                        Telnetd Environment Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has been made aware of a vulnerability with
some telnet daemons. The daemons affected are those that support RFC 1408
or RFC 1572, both titled "Telnet Environment Option," running on systems
that also support shared object libraries.

To determine if your system is potentially vulnerable, refer to the
information we have received from vendors which is summarized in
Section III below; details are in Appendix A and reproduced in the
CA-95:14.README file. Note that if you installed a version of David 
Borman's telnet package that is older than October 23, 1995, your
system may be vulnerable even though it was not vulnerable as distributed
by the vendor.

If your vendor is not listed, you will need to determine if your system
may be vulnerable. First, determine if your telnet daemon is RFC 1408/1572
compliant. One indication that it is compliant is if your telnet(1)
program supports the "environ" command or your telnetd(8) program supports
the ENVIRON or NEW-ENVIRON options. Unless you are certain that your
telnet daemon is not RFC 1408/1572 compliant, you may wish to assume it is
to be safe. Second, determine if your system supports shared libraries. To
do this, consult the ld(1) manual page. If it describes dynamic or shared
objects, your system probably supports shared object libraries. A system
is potentially vulnerable if the telnet daemon supports RFC 1408/RFC 1572
and the system supports shared object libraries.

We recommend that you follow your vendor's directions for addressing this
vulnerability. Until you can install a patch, we recommend using the
workaround in Appendix B below. If you have previously installed David
Borman's telnet package on your system, we recommend that you obtain the
current version of telnet (see Section III.C).

As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will
place it in:

        ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:14.README

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on
advisories that relate to your site.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     Some telnet daemons support RFC 1408 or RFC 1572, both titled "Telnet
     Environment Option." This extension to telnet provides the ability
     to transfer environment variables from one system to another. If
     the remote or targeted system, the one to which the telnet is
     connecting, is running an RFC 1408/RFC 1572-compliant telnet daemon
     *and* the targeted system also supports shared object libraries, then
     it may be possible to transfer environment variables that influence
     the login program called by the telnet daemon. By influencing that
     targeted system, a user may be able to bypass the normal login and
     authentication scheme and may become root on that system.

     Users with accounts on the targeted system can exploit this
     vulnerability. Users without accounts on that system can also
     exploit this vulnerability if they are first able to deposit an
     altered shared object library onto the targeted system. Therefore, a
     system may be vulnerable to users with and without local accounts.

     Not all systems that run an RFC 1408/RFC 1572-compliant telnet daemon
     and support shared object libraries are vulnerable. Some vendors have
     changed the trust model such that environment variables provided by
     the telnet daemon are not trusted and therefore are not used by the
     login program. Section III contains a summary of information vendors
     have reported as of the date of this advisory.

II.  Impact

     Local and remote users can become root on the targeted system.

III. Solution

     The general solution to this problem is to replace the telnet daemon 
     with one that changes the environment given to the login program. We
     recommend that you install a patch from your vendor if possible. If this
     is not possible, we recommend using the workaround in Appendix B until 
     you can install a patch. Finally, if you have previously installed Mr.
     Borman's telnet package, see Section C for how to get a new version that
     fixes the vulnerability. 

     A. Vendor Patches

        Below is a summary of the vendors listed in the current version of
        the CA-95:14.README file, and the status they have provided.  More
        complete information, including how to obtain patches, is provided
        in Appendix A of this advisory and reproduced in the README file.
        We will update the README file as we receive more information from
        vendors.

        If your vendor's name is not on this list, please contact the
        vendor directly.

        REMINDER: If you installed a version of David Borman's telnet package
                  that is older than October 23, 1995, your system may be
                  vulnerable even though it was not vulnerable as distributed 
                  by the vendor.

-------
Vulnerable.  A patch has been applied to the current development FreeBSD
source tree which is not yet released.  This patch is slightly modified
compared to posted one, i.e. only variables which affects FreeBSD are
disabled. It is telnetd patch, not a login wrapper.

For the official patch, location please contact: 

Jordan Hubbard <jkh@FreeBSD.org>

Harris
------
Harris Computer Systems Corporation's Night Hawk is not vulnerable.

Hewlett-Packard Company
-----------------------
HP/UX is not vulnerable.

Linux (freely available software; not a vendor)
-----
Debian GNU/Linux (From "Peter Tobias" <tobias@et-inf.fho-emden.de>):
The current version of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (released 10/27/95)
is not vulnerable anymore. All Debian Installations that use a netstd
package version prior to v1.21-1 are vulnerable (telnetd is part of
the netstd package). netstd-1.21-1 and above are ok.

Patches are available. Peter fixed the bug last week and uploaded the
fixed version to our ftp site (ftp.debian.org). Binaries, sources and
the diffs against the bsd telnetd can be found there.  The URL for the
new binary package is:

ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/debian-0.93/binary/net/netstd-1.21-1.deb

and the sources and the diff against the bsd telnetd can be found at:

ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/debian-0.93/source/net/netstd-1.21-1/telnetd.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/debian-0.93/source/net/netstd-1.21-1/telnetd.diff.gz

Red Hat Linux (From Erik Troan <ewt@redhat.com>):
Vulnerable.  A fix is now available at:

ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat-2.0/updates/NetKit-B-0.06-4.i386.rpm 
ftp://ftp.pht.com/pub/linux/redhat/redhat-2.0/updates/NetKit-B-0.06-4.i386.rpm 

It will also be fixed in the upcoming Red Hat 2.1 release.

Slackware Linux (Alan Cox <alan@cymru.net>):
The telnetd distributed with Slackware Linux appears to be vulnerable,
although it has not been verified.

MIT-distributed Athena telnet/telnet95
--------------------------------------
Vulnerable. Patches available in:
        ftp://aeneas.mit.edu/pub/kerberos/telnet-patch/

beta4-3.patch is the patch versus the Beta 4 patchlevel 3 distribution
of Kerberos v5.

beta5.patch is the patch versus the Beta 5 distribution of Kerberos V5.

Both patches have been PGP signed by Ted Ts'o <tytso@MIT.EDU> using
detached signatures (beta4-3.patch.sig and beta5.patch.sig).

NetBSD
------
NetBSD 1.0 (the last official release) is vulnerable; NetBSD 1.1 (due
out in mid-November) will not be.  NetBSD-current is not vulnerable,
as of a week or so ago.

Patches: A source form patch has been developed.  A core team member will
have to make source and binary patches available and provide a location for
it.

The login-wrapper given in the advisory can be compiled with NetBSD with:
        cc -o login-wrapper login-wrapper.c

The following two examples show how to compile the login-wrapper for SGI's
IRIX 5.3 and FreeBSD 2.x systems. The examples move the distributed login
program to a new location and install the wrapper in the standard location.
When executed, the wrapper first cleanses the environment and then calls
the relocated, distributed login program.

Note 1: The wrapper must be compiled statically. On SGI's IRIX system,
compiling statically requires that the non-shared versions of libraries
be installed. Consult your system documentation to determine how to do
this.

Note 2: You may need to change the _PATH_LOGIN variable to define where
the real login program resides on your system. On some systems, login
resides in /usr/bin/login.
