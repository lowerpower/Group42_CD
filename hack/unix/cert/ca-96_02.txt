CERT(sm) Advisory CA-96.02
February 15, 1996

Topic: BIND Version 4.9.3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerabilities in the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) program make it
possible for intruders to render Domain Name System (DNS) information
unreliable. At the beginning of this year, a version of BIND (4.9.3) became
available that fixes several security problems that are being exploited by
the intruder community. 

The CERT staff urges you to install the appropriate patch from your vendor. If
a patch is not currently available, an alternative is to install BIND 4.9.3
yourself. (Note: Although BIND will be further improved in the future, we urge
you to upgrade now because of the seriousness of the problems addressed by
version 4.9.3.) If neither of the above alternatives is possible, we strongly
recommend blocking or turning off DNS name-based authentication services such
as rlogin.

As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will add it
to 
     ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.02.README

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on advisories
that relate to your site.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     Version 4.9.3 of the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) program
     fixes several security problems that are well known and being 
     exploited by the intruder community to render Domain Name System (DNS)
     information unreliable.
    
     BIND is an implementation of the Domain Name System. (For details,
     see RFC 1035, a publication of the Internet Engineering Task Force.)
     The full distribution of BIND includes a number of programs and resolver
     library routines. The main program is "named", the daemon that provides
     DNS information from local configuration files and a local cache. The
     named daemon is often called /etc/named or /etc/in.named. Programs such
     as Telnet communicate with named via the resolver library routines
     provided in the BIND distribution.

     Services in widespread use that depend on DNS information for
     authentication include rlogin, rsh (rcp), xhost, and NFS. Sites may
     have installed locally other services that trust DNS information.
     In addition, many other services, such as Telnet, FTP, and email,
     trust DNS information. If these services are used only to make outbound
     connections or informational logs about the source of connections, the
     security impact is less severe than for services such as rlogin. Although
     you might be willing to accept the risks associated with using these
     services for now, you need to consider the impact that spoofed DNS
     information may have. 

     Although the new BIND distributions do address important security
     problems, not all known problems are fixed. In particular, several 
     problems can be fixed only with the use of cryptographic authentication
     techniques. Implementing and deploying this solution is non-trivial;
     work on this task is currently underway within the Internet community.  

II.  Impact

     It is possible for intruders to spoof BIND into providing incorrect
     name data. Some systems and programs depend on this information for
     authentication, so it is possible to spoof those systems and gain
     unauthorized access.  

III. Solutions
  
     The preferred solution, described in Section A, is to install your
     vendor's patch if one is available. An alternative (Section B) is to
     install the latest version of BIND. In both cases, we encourage you to
     take the additional precautions described in Section C.

  A. Obtain the appropriate patch from your vendor and install it according to
     instructions included with the program.

     Redistributing BIND and all programs affected by these problems is not
     a simple matter, so some vendors are working on new named daemon as an
     immediate patch. Although installing a new named daemon addresses some
     problems, significant problems remain that can be addressed only by
     fully installing fixes to the library resolver routines. 

     If your vendor's patch does not include both named and new resolver
     routines, we recommend that you install the current version of BIND
     (Solution B) if possible. We also encourage you to take the precautions
     described in Section C.

     Below is a list of the vendors and the status they have provided
     concerning BIND. More complete information is provided in Appendix A
     of this advisory and reproduced in CA-96.02.README. We will update
     the README file as we receive more information from vendors.

     If your vendor's name is not on the list, contact the vendor directly for
     status information and further instructions.

  B. Install the latest version of BIND (version 4.9.3), available from Paul
     Vixie, the current maintainer of BIND:
     
         ftp://ftp.vix.com/pub/bind/release/4.9.3/bind-4.9.3-REL.tar.gz
 
         MD5 (bind-4.9.3-REL.tar.gz) = da1908b001f8e6dc93fe02589b989ef1

      Also get Patch #1 for 4.9.3:
      
         ftp://ftp.vix.com/pub/bind/release/4.9.3/Patch1

         MD5 (Patch1) = 5d57ad13381e242cb08b5da0e1e9c5b9


  C. Take additional precautions.

     To protect against vulnerabilities that have not yet been addressed, and
     as good security practice in general, filter at a router all name-based
     authentication services so that you do not rely on DNS information for
     authentication. This includes the services rlogin, rsh (rcp), xhost, NFS,
     and any other locally installed services that provide trust based on
     domain name information.

Digital Equipment Corporation                              

At the time of writing this advisory, Digital intends to support the final
revision of BIND 4.9.3. The project plan for incorporating Version 4.9.3 BIND
for Digital's ULTRIX platforms has been approved. This includes 4.3, V4.3A,
V4.4 and V4.5.

A similar project plan for Digital UNIX versions is under review. The first
implementations will be V3.0 through V3.2D, and V4.0, when released. It is our
plan to evaluate and then incorporate V4.9.3 Bind into other UNIX versions as
necessary to reduce risk to our customer base.

Digital will provide notice of the completion of the kits through AES services
(DIA, DSNlink FLASH) and be available from your normal Digital Support
channel.

---------------------------------------
Hewlett-Packard Company

The named daemon is under investigation. HP will provide updated
information for the CERT advisory README.
      
HP is currently porting and testing BIND 4.9.3 for a general release
first quarter of 1997. A patch is in process for 10.X releases. Watch
for README updates and a Security Bulletin from HP.
