CERT(sm) Advisory CA-96.04                       
February 22, 1996

Topic: Corrupt Information from Network Servers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of intruders exploiting
systems by corrupting data provided by a Domain Name Service (DNS) server.
Although these reports have focused only on DNS, this vulnerability could
apply to any network service from which data is received and subsequently
used.

Section III.A contains a pointer to two subroutines that address the DNS
problem. These subroutines, written in the C programming language, can be used
to validate host names and IP addresses according to RFCs 952 and 1123, as
well as names containing characters drawn from common practice, namely "_" and
"/".

In the specific case of sendmail, the problem has already been addressed by
patches (see Section III.B).

As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will place
it in
        ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.04.README

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on
advisories that relate to your site.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     Information provided by an information server may be of a form that
     could cause programs to operate in unexpected ways. The subroutines and
     programs transferring data from that information server could check the
     data for correctness of form; however, programs that *use* that data are
     ultimately responsible for ensuring adherence to the documents that
     define the correct form.

     For example, consider a program that uses the host name returned by
     gethostbyname() as part of the string given to the popen() or system()
     subroutines. Because gethostbyname() may use an information server
     beyond your control, the data returned could be of a form that causes
     the popen() or system() subroutines to execute other commands besides
     the command specified by that program.

     This advisory speaks to a specific instance of a problem caused by the
     information returned by DNS, but information from any server should be
     checked for validity. Examples of other information servers are YP, NIS,
     NIS+, and netinfo.

II.  Impact

     Programs that do not check data provided by information servers may 
     operate in unpredictable ways and give unexpected results. In
     particular, exploitation of this vulnerability may allow remote access
     by unauthorized users. Exploitation can also lead to root access by both
     local and remote users. 


III. Solution

     For programs that you write or have written, consider integrating the
     general solution in Section A below.

     In the specific case of the sendmail mail delivery program, Eric Allman,
     the original author of sendmail, has produced patches that address the
     problem. Section B provides details about these, along with vendor
     information and additional steps you should take to protect sendmail. 
     

     A. General solution for Internet host names

        Use the host name and IP address validation subroutines available
        at the locations listed below. Include them in all programs that
        use the result of the host name lookups in any way.

            ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/ValidateHostname/IsValid.c
            ftp://ftp.cert.dfn.de/pub/tools/net/ValidateHostname/IsValid.c

            Checksum: 
            MD5 (IsValid.c) = 9456f2f5dcb226eaa19a72256c8d1922
                             
        The IsValid.c file contains code for the IsValidHostname and
        IsValidIPAddress subroutines. This code can be used to check host
        names and IP addresses for validity according to RFCs 952 and 1123,
        well as names containing characters drawn from common practice,
        namely "_" and "/". 


     B. Specific solutions in the case of sendmail

        Install a patch from your vendor when it becomes available (see B.1)
        or install Eric Allman's patch (B.2). In both cases, install the
        sendmail restricted shell program (B.3).

     1. Install a patch from your vendor.

        Below is a summary of the vendors who have reported status to us as
        of the date of this advisory. More complete information is provided in
        the appendix of this advisory and reproduced in the CA-96.04.README
        file. We will update the README file as we receive more information.

        If your vendor's name is not on this list, please contact the vendor
        directly.

        Vendor or Source          Status
        ----------------          ------------
        Eric Allman               Patches available.
        Hewlett-Packard Co.       Vulnerable, watch readme file for updates.
        IBM Corporation           Working on fixes for sendmail.
        Silicon Graphics Inc.     Patch planned. 


     2. Install a patch to sendmail.

        If you are presently running sendmail 8.6.12, there is a patch that
        makes version 8.6.13. 

        Similarly, if you are presently running sendmail 8.7.3, there is a
        patch that makes version 8.7.4. 

        The patches are available for anonymous FTP from

        ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/sendmail/
        ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/src/sendmail/
        ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/mirrors/ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail/
        ftp://ftp.cert.dfn.de/pub/tools/net/sendmail/

        
        Checksums for the 8.6.13 release:
          MD5 (sendmail.8.6.13.base.tar.Z) = e8cf3ea19876d9b9def5c0bcb793d241
          MD5 (sendmail.8.6.13.cf.tar.Z) = 4492026fa9e750cd33974322cb5a6fb9
          MD5 (sendmail.8.6.13.misc.tar.Z) = 7ec5d31656e93e08a3892f0ae542b674
          MD5 (sendmail.8.6.13.xdoc.tar.Z) = e4d3caebcdc4912ed2ecce1a77e45712

        Checksum for the 8.6.13 patch:
           MD5 (sendmail.8.6.13.patch) = 6390b792cb5513ff622da8791d6d2073

        Checksum for the 8.7.4 release:
           MD5 (sendmail.8.7.4.tar.Z) = 4bf774a12752497527aae11e2bdbab36

        Checksum for the 8.7.4 patch:
           MD5 (sendmail.8.7.4.patch) = ef828ad91fe56e4eb6b0cacced864cd5


     3. Run smrsh as additional protection for sendmail.

        With all versions of sendmail, we recommend that you install and use
        the sendmail restricted shell program (smrsh). We urge you to do
        this whether you use the vendor's supplied sendmail, install sendmail
        yourself, or patch an earlier version of sendmail.

        Beginning with version 8.7.1, smrsh is included in the sendmail
        distribution, in the subdirectory smrsh. See the RELEASE_NOTES file
        for a description of how to integrate smrsh into your sendmail
        configuration file.
