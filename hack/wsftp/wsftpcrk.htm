This document will explain how to defeat WS_FTP32 client side password encryption and a temporary
solution to resolve this problem.  The ease of defeating of this encryption
scheme is very alarming, since majority of Windows users on the Internet use
WS_FTP32 as their main ftp client.  To defeat the encryption routine only
takes a few lines of <A

I would like to thank Nightshd and Yoshi for bringing up this topic and
assisting in defeating it!

<UL>
  <LI>People running a variant of Windows.  Windows NT being an exception, for
  if configured properly it can be secure.  However this does <B>NOT</B> fix the
  problem!
  <LI>Home users, goverment agencies and corporations use this as their main ftp
  client.  Home users are generaly excluded unless you have very nasty friends.
  Goverment agencies and business are more at risk, since Windows is not a very
  secure operating system.

    <I>Password Details</I><BR>
<hr size=1>
  </H2>
</CENTER>

<UL>
  <LI>Passwords are a maximum of 78 characters.
  <LI>Passwords can contain letters, numbers and high end ASCII (MS-DOS) characters.  Most
      users only use letters and numbers in their passwords.
  <LI>Password lengths are always divisible by 2.
  <LI>Passwords once encrypted are stored as hex string in an INI file called
      WS_FTP.INI.  It is either located in the Windows home directory or in WS_FTP
      home directory.<P>
     <I>
       Example:<BR>
       [Test System]<BR>
       HOST=0<BR>
       UID=MindRape<BR>
       PWD=6162636465<BR>
       PASVMODE=0<BR>
     </I>
  <LI> Two 1 digit hex values make up one ASCII character.  For example this hex
       string contains '69626A'.  It's character makeup is this, (69)(62)(6A), which is
       3 characters.
  <LI> The hex string is stored as a C style string.  It's index is starting at 0.

The password encryption is fairly simple,  it closely resembles a Ceasar Cipher.
<P>
For every two 1 digit hex value, concatenate them together to produce 1 hex
value.  Then take it's index (C Styled) in the string and substract from
the hex value.  This will produce the correct ASCII value.
<P>
Example:<BR>
Lets take the password '48666E6F73255D767A756E2C' (from WS_FTP.INI) and try to
decrypt it.
<P>
First break down the string into it true hex values.<BR>
(48)(66)(6E)(6F)(73)(25)(5D)(76)(7A)(75)(6E)(2C)
<P>
Since this is a C Style string, it's index starts as 0.  Lets decode the
password now.
<P>
(0x48)-0 = 48 = H<BR>
(0x66)-1 = 65 = E<BR>
(0x6E)-2 = 6C = L<BR>
(0x6F)-3 = 6C = L<BR>
...<BR>
<P>
Eventually it produces the string 'Hello World!'.
<P>
Here is some <A

source code</A> to do it for you.

    <I>Work Around</I><BR>

The recommended work around is not to use the Save Password feature of WS_FTP32.
This is generally a good idea across all secured applications.  For without the
password encryption scheme being publicly reviewed and also the implementation
of such a scheme, one should <B>NEVER</B> trust any feature such as this.
