<h3>How to Use</h3>

From within any WWW browser, choose OPEN FILE and select INDEX.HTM
in the root directory of your CD-ROM drive. Your WWW browser will
do the rest. Although any WWW browser will work, we reccommend a 
HTML 2.0 compliant WWW browser like <a href="#netscape">Netscape 1.2</a>
or later.
<p>

<h3>Screen Size</h3>
On some browsers, when viewing .txt files, text may spill off the
right side of the screen making the files difficult to read.  This
can be fixed by configuring your browser's <b>Fixed Font</b> to a
smaller size (one or two points smaller).  This will make the text
slightly smaller, but enable you to see the whole width of the
page on your screen without having to use the horizontal scroll bars.
<p>

<h3>Compressed Files</h3>

Some of the files on this CD-ROM are compressed with PKzip. To view 
or execute these files, set the helper application option of your
WWW browser to:
<ul>

<li>Run an expansion program you may already have.
<li>Save the file to your hard drive to expand later.

</ul>
Some WWW browsers may allow you to "right-click" or "control-click"
on a link to save the file to disk. For more information, see the
<a href="utils/index.htm">UTILS</a> section of this CD-ROM.

<p>
<a name="netscape">
<h3>Obtaining Netscape</h3>

Netscape may be downloaded directly from Netscape Communication Corporation
at http://home.netscape.com/ or from mirror ftp sites such as:
<ul>
<li>ftp.winsite.com
<li>ftp.orst.edu
<li>ftp.oakland.edu
</ul>
In addition, Netscape may be purchased from your local software
dealer for a marginal fee.
