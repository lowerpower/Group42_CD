Cut a 3 in. by 2 ft. 4 in. blue strip 
of posterboard. Paste it on the top of
the white posterboard. Put the name
of the state which you want your
license to be from in 2 in. letters on
the blue strip. 




Tips:
-----

The print on the fake ID is always in
Caps.
When you are looking at the ID the 
picture will always be to the left.

An easy way to get your age changed on
your original(if you have a license)
