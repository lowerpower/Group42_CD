<h2>Color Printer Update</h2>
<h4>By Nickle of Group 42</h4>

I've been looking low cost printer capable of reproducing documents,
currently in the $400 to $500 range your choice is the HP855, Epson
Color Stylus II and the Cannon BJ-610.  For photo realistic the HP855
is not an option, although it prints black real well it cannot reproduce
colors nearly as well as the Epson or Cannon.
<p>
Output of the Epson although good, is not up to the quality of the Cannon.
The Cannon would be my choice for photo realistic photos in this class
of printer.
<p>
There may be other printers out there in this price range by the time
you read this, so check before going out and buying one.
