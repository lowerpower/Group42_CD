<h2>Making Rubber Stamps</h2>
<h4>By Nickle of Group 42</h4>

<i>An Update Version from the Group 42 Publication <b>Hacking, Cracking,
Phun and Games</b></i>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
As we shall see making rubber stamps is quite easy, but you may be
asking yourself why you would want to make rubber stamps.  There
are many reasons, but one of the ones we have found is to make seals.
Having a county seal is very handy even if it is just a rubber stamp
of the seal.  With a county seal stamp you could :

<p>
<ul>
<li>Stamp homemade birth-certificates.
<li>Make official looking documents.
</ul>
Making official looking documents is very powerfull, you could even
type up a letter and stamp it to get a embosser manufacture to make
you an embosser version of the stamp!  Go to the county seat and see
what kind of documents they stamp, it will give you some ideas.
<p>
<h4>How You Make Them</h4>
Rubber stamps can be made with a laser printer, an intense ultraviolet
light (in a sealed, light tight box), a couple of transparencies and
some special resin.
<p>
First you design your stamp with your favorite desktop publishing
program.  Then you print out two <i>negitive</i> copies along with
registration marks.  Align the transparencies and add some of the
resin.  Expose to the ultra violet light for a few miniuts.  Peel
the stamp off and clean up the unhardened resin and mount the stamp
on a block of wood.
<p>
The ultra violet light hardens the resin where ever it touches.  The
negitave transparencies block the light from touching part of the
resin, this part is washed away after the process is over yealding
your stamp.
<p>
<h4>Where To Get The Supplies</h4>
A company called Polly Stamp carries all the necessary stuff including
the ultra violet light boxes.  You may want to build your own box since
theres goies for $595 used, and could be built for $50 and a little
labor.  They do have a manual that describes much of this in greater
detail.  Contact them at:

<h4>Where To Get The Artwork</h4>
The best place I've seen to get county and state seal information is
in the phone book.  Usually in the government sections located in the
beginning of the book.  The are usually oversized and are ideal
for scanning or copying.
<p>
Before we got the stamp idea, we actually wrote all the county seats
in California telling them we were doing a project for a California
History class at collage, requesting a stamp of there county seal.
We got an unbelevable response that included a stamped letter.  Some
were great and only said <i>Here is the stamp you requested</i> signed
<i>The County Clerk</i>.  We took these to stamp makers and got stamps
made special, they took these letters as permission to make stamps :')
