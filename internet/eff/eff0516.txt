Outline of Testimony Before NIST Advisory Board
***********************************************

On September 2, 1993, Jerry Berman and Bruce Heiman of the Digital Privacy
and Security Working Group, a coalition of over 50 telecommunications,
computer and public interest organizations chaired by EFF, testified before
the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board to NIST on the
Administration's Clipper/Skipjack proposal.  Here is an outline of the
testimony.

Before the

COMPUTER SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY ADVISORY BOARD
Baltimore, MD

Comments of the 

DIGITAL PRIVACY AND SECURITY WORKING GROUP

September 2, 1993


The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group has been meeting for almost
half a year discussing options for a new policy on cryptography, privacy,
and security.  These comments represent a summary of the Working Group's
progress and will be presented in more complete form in a report to be made
public early in the fall.

GOALS

A.      The Digital Privacy & Security Working Group shares the Clinton
Administration's goal of promoting the development of the National and
International Information Infrastructure

B.      Critical attributes of the emerging information infrastructure are:

o       Interoperability across a network of networks

o       Adherence to national and international standards

o       Security

o       Privacy

C.      DPSWG conclusions regarding security and privacy policy

o       Strong encryption must be widely available in the market for the
NII and the III to succeed as new pathways for commerce and communication.

o       Encryption used must be TRUSTED and must accommodate FLEXIBLE
IMPLEMENTATIONS.

o       Encryption policy must assure compliance with constitutional
privacy guarantees while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement
and national security.
 A PUBLIC POLICY AGENDA

We are aware that the Clinton Administration is in the process of
completing a comprehensive policy review in this area.  Based on our common
goal of developing the National Information Infrastructure, we are hopeful
that we can reach agreement with the Administration on the following
principles as a framework for a new public policy on cryptography, privacy,
and security.

A.      The private sector could accept Clipper/Slipjack as one of many
cryptographic systems, provided its use remains truly voluntary.

The user market must be allowed to pick the most appropriate cryptographic
tools, without undue interference of government purchasing power or
domestic legal barriers.

B.      In order to promote the use and development of strong encryption
critical to the NII, the Administration should act swiftly to relax current
export controls on cryptography.

A critical indication of the voluntariness of Slipjack will be the
willingness of the Administration to relax export controls.

C.      Even if a truly voluntary escrow system is proposed, many questions
must be answered by the Administration before any escrow system could be
accepted.

o       Who will act as escrow agents?

o       What public policy mechanism will guaranty that key escrow remains
a voluntary option?

o       What public policy mechanism will guarantee the privacy and
security of escrowed keys?  

o       Who will be liable in the event of a security breach?

D.      Before making a final decision on Clipper/Skipjack, a more complete
evaluation of law enforcement concerns must be presented publicly.

o       No quantitative, cost-benefit analysis has yet been presented.

 o      No explanation of how a voluntary escrow system solves law
enforcement problems, given the continued availability of other
non-escrowed cryptography systems, has been offered.

o       No public consideration of alternatives to escrow systems has been
undertaken.

E.      Digital Telephony

o       Documented problems have been rectified.

o       There is a general willingness to establish a more formal
government-private sector consultation process to resolve any other
identifiable problems now or in the future.

o       No justification for legislation exists at this time.

CONCLUSION

Telecommunications Radio Project Returns
****************************************

The Telecommunications Radio Project at KPFA-FM in Berkeley is delighted
to announce the returen of our award-winning series "The Communications
Revolution."

Your support and participation with last year's series was fundamental
to its success both as it aired and afterwards as listeners called to
request tapes, transcripts, and resource guides in unprecedented 
numbers.  I hope that you will help us once again by sharing 
information about "The Communications Revolution" with your friends,
colleagues, members, etc.

Following please find a list of this year's programs:

November 3, 1993 9am PST
Technophobia:  The Social Disease of the '90s
Who invents these gadgets that come with a fifty page operator's manual?
Why is it that "user friendly" usaully isn't?  Why do I need an 
engineering degree to operate my VCR?  And why aren't humane, 
environmentally conscious values considered in the R&D of telecommunications?

November 10, 1993  9am PST
The New Sweatshops:  The Glamour-less Electronics Industry
The popular image of hi-tech jobs doesn't include the segregated 
workplace of immigrant workers in low pay, high stress, repetitive
and hazardous labor--all the ones who create the new gadgets and 
gizmos of the computer age.

November 17, 1993  9am PST
Nintendo Over Baghdad:  The Future of War
Will new hi-tech weaponry make the unthinkable thinkable?  Can war now 
be presented to the American public as a clean, sanitary affair,
causing minimal (and therefore acceptable) "collateral damage"?  How are 
telecommunications technologies contributing to a new mass 
psychology regarding war?

November 24, 1993
When Your Health History Becomes Public Record
The federal government is talking about creating a centralized national
database for all our health records.  They're already available to your
future employer, landlord, neighbor.  What is your right to privacy
concerning your personal health history?

December 1, 1993
Art and Music through the Nets:  The Death of Individual Creativity?
Interactive technologies increase accessibility to original art and music.
Will we see the end of copyrights?  Who owns culture and what is 
intellectual property in the age of electronic collaboration?

December 8, 1993
The New National Information Infostructure:  What's in it for Me?
Internet, NREN, whatever you want to call it, an electronic interlink
between government, education, and business organizations is 
rapidly taking shape.  How are the  big players jockeying for a 
piece of the action, and will the average citizen be left out of the
game?

December 15, 1993
Electronic Porn and Computer Network Censorship
Cyberpunk culture dabbles in pornography and we have Playboy on 
CD-ROM.  Does anyone have a right to regulate or censor this material?
What are the issues surrounding the debate between civil liberties and
the protection of the public?

December 22, 1993
Occupational Hazards with Telecommunications Tools
Why is it that after years of repetitive motion on typewriters, carpal
tunnel syndrome is only now becoming widespread with the use of 
computers?  Is it something about the keyboards?  What's the 
latest on electromagnetic fields?  VDT radiation?

December 29, 1993
Technology in the Classroom:  No Substitute for Teachers?
Distance learning allows students from K through college access to 
programs and materials not in their schools.  A new global village
is being created in which kids learn from each other across continents.
Are these glitzy gadgets for the few or an answer to our national 
crisis in education?

January 5, 1994
Update on Competition since Divestiture:  Who Wins and Who Loses?
The phone companies are getting ready to compete for regional toll 
calls, offer new services such as multiple TV channels and interactive
television.  But some groups, such as rural residents, may be left
out.  Basic and Lifeline rates may go up.  What will be the 
status of consumer protections with the new telecom technologies?

January 12, 1994
The Death of Privacy--and Forget About Anonymity too
Some workplaces now require that you carry a "smart card" so that you
can be located anytime.  City employees in one western city were asked
to resign when the mayor read their e-mail messages--which were all
about him!  What are our rights to privacy and anonymity in the 
computer age?

January 19, 1994
Can Instant Global Telecommunications be a Tool for Social Change?
The environmental movement uses computer networks, fax, and 
other telecom tools for organizing.  But how effective are they really?
And how are conservative organizations networking in the '90s via 
computer databases, fax, and modem?

January 26, 1994
Future Media:  Instant News for Instant Views
Editorial control over content of news and increasing pressure on news
rooms to offer "infotainment" to the public is made easier by new 
telecommunications news gathering tools. How is all this working and
what will be its effect on informing the public?

All shows will air at 9 am PST. For more information about the series
or for a list of stations carrying the show, please contact me at:

Coming Soon:  Commercial Version of PGP
***************************************

Philip Zimmermann has signed an agreement with ViaCrypt, a division
of Lemcom Systems, Inc., to sell a commercial version of PGP.  ViaCrypt
is a company in Phoenix, Arizona, that already has an RSA license from 
Public Key Partners to sell products that use the RSA algorithm.

The freeware version of PGP will still be available and will be
maintained as well as the commercial version.  Most corporations
were not willing to use PGP because it was not licensed by PKP
or RSA Data Security.  With this commercial version of PGP, it will be
possible for PGP to enter commercial environments for the first time
and compete with other products such as PEM.  This is expected to 
enhance PGP's viability as a de facto standard in the long run.

ViaCrypt PGP will be available in the USA and Canada, for an introductory
price of $100 for a single user, with quantity discounts available.
For details, call ViaCrypt at (602) 944-0773, or contact Philip 
Zimmermann at prz@acm.org.

ASIS 1994 Mid Year Call for Papers
**********************************

Call For Participation
1994 Mid-Year Meeting, American Society for Information Science

Navigating the Networks
May 22 - 25, 1994
Red Lion Hotel, Columbia River
Portland, Oregon

With amazing speed electronic networking systems have grown up around us;
once simple roads leading directly to our destination have become a complex
of interchanges and intersections, whether seen or not.  Networking has
experienced a phenomenal rate of growth (11,000 networks currently); the
need for road maps, directional signs and directories is painfully clear
and the implementation of wireless communications has barely begun.

What will the interfaces be in the future?  Will there be "smart highways"
guiding drivers speed, direction, etc. and determining the best routing? 
Will knowbots become the search vehicle of choice?  Who, if anyone, will be
the electronic traffic cops and can we rely on either the legislatures or
the courts to determine our future?  Will there be toll roads? Can the
electronic highways as we now know them (public networks) support both
individual users (passenger cars) and commercial users (the tractor
trailers of the digital highways)?  What changes will take place in
publishing, both scholarly and commercial?

While online communicating via networks was once predominantly
academic/research, the corporate world is the fastest growing sector (over
500,000 users) of national and international network users.  Commercial
growth, however, has been slowed by security concerns.  How will legitimate
U.S. and corporate security concerns and individual privacy fears be
ameliorated in the new high speed data highway system?  Will commercial
traffic fundamentally alter the education/research sense of community that
has grown up with Internet?

Will "sneaker nets," LANs and WANs, be replaced by wireless networks,
groupware and collaborative computer- supported work.  What changes will
result in how we work and what we do?  Will decisions inexorably become
more democratic but slower as has been predicted?  Will the horns and
shouts of inner city traffic be a metaphor for the "white noise" of
computer lists and discussion groups?  What tools exist for filtering out
"noise" and what impact will that have on our work?

Invitation

The 1994 ASIS Mid-Year Meeting, "Navigating the Networks" has as its focus
the human side of networks, the psychology and sociology of using networks.
 What has been and will be the impact of networking technology on the
individual and on organizations, their structure and goals?  Original
contributed papers are solicited on all aspects of networking use in
information management.  Panel discussions exploring legal and
philosophical questions of use, quality, distribution, control, and
ownership are welcome.  Presentations of new technologies or applications
to solve our information management problems are welcome.  We invite
submissions of papers, panels, tutorials, demonstrations and original ideas
for programs on networking.  

Types of Submissions
