Subject: Upcoming Congressional Hearings on Clipper and Digital Telephony
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congressional hearings on the Administration's Clipper/Skipjack initiative,
and the FBI's draft Digital Telephony surveillance bill, and their
implications for privacy and First Amendment rights, are to be held
April 27 and May 3, 1994.

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), of the Senate Judiciary's Technology and the Law
Subcommittee, has expressed skepticism of the Clipper encryption scheme,
and has called for hearings to examine the problems of this proposal and its
implementation.  This effort is due in part to all of you who responded to
EFF's grassroots campaign to raise fundamental questions about security and
free speech issues in relation to the White House proposal.

The Senate hearing will be held on April 27, 1994, 9:30am EDT, Hart
Building Rm. 216, and should feature testimony from the Digital Security
and Privacy Working Group (a broad coalition of industry and public
interest organizations, headed by EFF), Trusted Information Systems' Steve
Walker, Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems, a representative of the
Justice Dept. (possibly Atty. Gen. Janet Reno), NSA Director Adm. Mike
McConnell, and Ray Kammer of NIST.

For more information, contact Senate staffers at the Senate Judiciary
Committee: +1 202 224 3406 (voice), +1 202 224 9516 (fax)
Note: this is the full Committee's fax, so address faxes to "Technology
and the Law Subcommittee" or delivery may be delayed.


Following the Senate Hearings, the House Science, Space and Technology
Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and Aviation will be holding a
hearing to address related civil liberties issues of both the Clipper
scheme and the FBI "Digital Telephony" proposal, which so far remains
unsponsored. The hearing will be chaired by Rep. Tim Valentine (D-NC), and
is scheduled for May 3, 1994, 1pm EDT, Rayburn Building Rm. 2318.  Witnesses
will include Ray Kammer of NIST, NSA's Clint Brooks, representatives from
industry in a panel that will include USTA and TIA, expert witnesses
Dorothy Denning and David Farber, and EFF's Jerry Berman on behalf of
DPSWG.  FBI appears not to be making a showing.

The House hearing is being held "to review the Administration's policies
and legislative proposals dealing with electronic survellance, privacy
and security, ...the adequacy of the Computer Security Act in protecting
goverment computer systems", and "the Administration's proposed Digital
Telephony legislation and decision to promulgate a voluntary federal
encryption standard".

Subject: EFF Position Available: Membership Director
----------------------------------------------------

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit organization working
on the cutting edge of civil liberties law and policy in high technology, is
looking for a Membership Director to help us educate the public about our
mission and expand our membership.

The Membership Director is responsible for the planning, structure and
development of EFF's membership program.  These duties include:  developing
a goal-oriented, strategic membership plan; regularly reporting progress
and results to EFF's Executive Director and board; and developing a program
budget and being primarily responsible for seeing that the membership
program operates within budget.

In addition, the Membership Director is responsible for working with EFF
staff to coordinate membership efforts around timely events and

Subject: NTIA Privacy Notice of Inquiry - Deadline Extended, Act Now!
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier this year, NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry and Request for Comment
from the public on "privacy issues relating to private sector use of
telecommunications-related personal information associated
with the National Information Infrastructure."  The comments will have
bearing on an upcoming National Telecommunications and Information
Administration report "which may make recommendations to the Information
Infrastructure Task Force and Congress in the area of telecommunications
and information policy".

Last week, EFF called NTIA asking when their privacy report would be made,
and were told that the scheduling was still somewhat flexible, but that
surprisingly few comments had been received before the March 30 deadline. 
We've worked with NTIA's Carol Mattey to reopen the Request for Comments,
with successful results:

"Taking into account your expressed interest, and inquiries from
several others, we have decided to formally reopen the record in
NTIA's inquiry on privacy issues for additional comments. 
Attached to this message is a statement formally inviting
additional comments to be filed on or before May 23, 1994.  (This
statement will be sent out in a press release and published in
the Federal Register sometime next week.)  Please disseminate
this statement, with the NOI, immediately to all who you think
might be interested.  We want to hear a wide range of views, but
have to rely on groups like yours to spread that message, as we
just do not have the resources to personally seek out all
potentially interested parties.

Carol Mattey, NTIA"

CONTACT:  Larry Williams           NTIA EXTENDS NOTICE OF 
(202) 482-1551                     INQUIRY ON PRIVACY ISSUES

TECHNICAL NEWS ADVISORY            April 19, 1994


     The National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) has extended the deadline for filing
comments in its privacy Notice of Inquiry (NOI) to May 23, 1994.

     On February 11, 1994, NTIA published a Notice of Inquiry and
Request for Comments in the Federal Register entitled "Inquiry on
Privacy Issues Relating to Private Sector Use of
Telecommunications-Related Information."  59 FR 6842.

     NTIA has received comments from 30 parties in this
proceeding.  Those comments can be reviewed in NTIA's Openness
Room, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 4092, 14th St. and
Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, between the
hours of 9:00 am - 5:00 pm.  For further information about NTIA's
Openness Room, contact Norbert Schroeder at (202)482-6207.

     Since the comment deadline date, NTIA has received several
requests for extension of time to file comments.  In the interest
of fairness to all potentially interested parties, and to provide
an additional opportunity to develop the record in this
proceeding, NTIA will allow additional time in which to file
comments.

     Additional comments should be filed on or before May 23,
1994, to receive full consideration.  Please submit seven copies
to the Office of Policy Analysis and Development, NTIA, U.S.
Department of Commerce, Room 4725, 14th St. and Pennsylvania
Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C.  20230.  Comments also may be
submitted electronically via Internet to cmattey@ntia.doc.gov.

     For further information, please contact Carol Mattey or Lisa
Leidig, Office of Policy Analysis and Development, NTIA, at (202)
482-1880.

 ********

In discussion with Ms. Mattey, she advised that NTIA would prefer to
receive comments specifically responding to the issues raised in the notice,
outlined clearly where possible, and that it would be useful for lengthy
comments to have a short summary at the top.

The easier you make it for them parse your comments the easier it is
for them to take your comments into consideration.  This holds true for
any submission of comments to government agencies or legislators.

Subject: New York Bill for Public Access to Govt. Info Needs Support
--------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a New York Assembly bill, AB10035 pending which would provide for
free online access to NY legislative information.  This information is 
already paid for by NY state taxes, yet currently is available
electronically only through an expensive commercial firm.

Reg Neale <neale@ee.rochester.edu>, one of the first to bring this bill to
the attention of the Internet/Usenet community, collected some contact
information and had this to say about this legislation:

 "A bill was just introduced in the NY Assembly to make public information
 freely and timely available, via "the most-accessible and least-cost
 public network" i.e., the Internet. Bill A10035 was referred to the
 Assembly's Governmental Operations Committee, where it is certain to die
 unless there is a massive input from concerned citizens. Any New Yorkers
 reading this should call or write their assemblyperson to urge immediate
 action on this bill. It could also be helpful to contact these two
 individuals:


 Assemblyman Samuel Colman, Chairman
 Governmental Operations Committee
 Room 731 Legislative Office Building
 Albany NY 12248
 518-455-5118 voice
 518-455-5119 fax

 David W. Keiper, Commissioner
 Legislative Bill Drafting Commission
 Room 301 Capitol Building
 Albany NY 12247
 518-455-7500
 CIS 71075,2006
 [Internet: 71075.2006@compuserve.com]

 Voice your support for public access to legislative information. If you
 know of anyone who should be involved in this effort, or if you know of
 another appropriate place to post this message, please contact me.

 Reginald Neale, Sec'y   Citizens for Open Access to Legislation (C.O.A.L.)
 716-263-7864 day     716-924-7481 eve"

Accounts from other parties suggest that some support for this bill is
building, among citizens and in the Assembly, so adding your support is not
a waste of time.

Activism got a bill very similar to this one passed in CA last year, and it
can work in NY too.  See ftp.eff.org: /pub/EFF/Issues/Activism/* for more
information on online activism.  Three civil-liberties-favoring state
bills dealing with online information have already failed this year, two
in Oklahoma, and one in Maryland, due to lack of public input and support.

Those in New York state should spread the word on local and state news
groups, mailing lists and other online forums, and can join the Society
for Electronic Access's sea-10035 mailing list (send subscribe requests to
sea-10035-request@sea.org) for local activist planning and information
on this bill.

Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when
the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally
alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The
greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal,
well-meaning but without understanding."

  - Justice Louis D. Brandeis, dissenting, Olmstead v. United States,
    277 U.S. 479 (1928)

You've been following the newspapers and reading EFFector Online. 
You know that today there are several battles being fought over the future
of personal privacy.  The Clipper chip, export restrictions, the Digital
Telephony proposal - the arguments are numerous and complex, but the
principles are clear.  Who will decide how much privacy is "enough"?

The Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that individuals should be
able to ensure the privacy of their personal communications through any
technological means they choose.  However, the government's current
restrictions on the export of encrytion software have stifled the
development and commercial availability of strong encryption in the U.S. 
Rep. Maria Cantwell has introduced a bill (H.R. 3627) in the House that
would liberalize export controls on software that contains encryption, but
needs vocal support if the bill is to make it out of the committee stage.  

The decisions that are made today will affect our futures indefinitely.  
EFF is a respected voice for the rights of users of online technologies
and EFF members receive regular online updates on the issues that affect
our online communications and particpate in shaping the future.

Now, more than ever, EFF is working to make sure that you are the one that
makes these decisions for yourself.  Our members are making themselves heard
on the whole range of issues.  To date, EFF has collected over 4800 letters
of support for Rep. Cantwell's bill to liberalize restrictions on
cryptography.  We also have over 1400 letters supporting Sen. Leahy's 
open hearings on the proposed Clipper encryption scheme, scheduled for
April 27, 1994.

If you'd like to add your voice in support of the Cantwell bill, send
email to cantwell@eff.org, Subject: I support HR 3627

Your letters will be printed out and hand delivered to Rep. Cantwell by EFF.

You KNOW privacy is important. You have probably participated in our online
campaigns.  Have you become a member of EFF yet?  The best way to protect
your online rights is to be fully informed and to make your opinions heard.
EFF members are informed and are making a difference.  Join EFF today!

EFF PGP Public Key for Encryption
=================================

This is the ASCII-armored PGP 2.4 public key for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF).

Note that mail sent with this key will be considered addressed to EFF in
general, not to a specific person, unless otherwise noted.  To send
personal information to someone at EFF, for whatever reason, please use
that person's own key, or arrange some other method of communication.

This key is provided principally for the sending of sensitive legal
information, and the transmission of credit card numbers over the net
securely when becoming a member of EFF.  It takes us time and effort to 
decrypt, so please don't use this key trivially.  Thank you.

To add this key to your public key ring, do:

pgp -ka pgpkey.eff pubring.pgp

If your public key ring has another name, use that instead of pubring.pgp.

For MacPGP, click on Key | Add Key, select pgpkey.eff as file to get key from,
and pubring.pgp (or whatever your pubring is) for file to add key to.

To encrypt a message, please see the PGP documentation, and remember that you
will almost certainly need to generate the result as an ASCII-armored file,
so you can email it (non-ASCII-armored PGP ciphertexts are binary, and will
get mangled if you try to email them.
