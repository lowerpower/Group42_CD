Subject: PGP 2.5 available from Electronic Frontier Foundation ftp site
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

With the early May announcement of the availability of the new version of 
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) a free encryption program for email and other
files, EFF has decided to provide PGP and other cryptographic material to
users of the Internet.  EFF applauds and congratulates the PGP development
team, MIT (who initially made PGP 2.5 available), and RSA Data Security
(patent holders of the RSA and RSAREF encryption code) for coming to an
agreement and providing this new version of the most popular email encryption
program in the world - a free version that is finally legal in the US.

Previous versions of PGP arguably violated US patent law, with the
exception of ViaCrypt's commercial PGP 2.4, but the new 2.5 is built upon
the free RSAREF encryption functions, rather than the previous RSA functions
which required a special licensing arrangement for use in applications
like PGP.  

Despite the patent & licensing issues being resolved, PGP is still not legally
exportable from the United States (except to Canada), due to ITAR export
restrictions which categorize cryptographic materials as weapons of war.  
Thus, EFF can only make PGP and other crypto tools and source code available
to US and Canadian nationals currently residing in the US or Canada and
connecting to EFF's site from a US or Canadian site.

PGP and similar material is available from EFF's ftp site in a hidden
directory, and only to Americans and Canadians.  Access to this directory
can be obtained by reading and following the instructions in the README.Dist
file at:

ftp.eff.org, /pub/Net_info/Tools/Crypto/
gopher.eff.org, 1/Net_info/Tools/Crypto
gopher://gopher.eff.org/11/Net_info/Tools/Crypto
http://www.eff.org/pub/Net_info/Tools/Crypto/

PGP can only be obtained from EFF via ftp currently.  Gopher and WWW
access to the material itself is not supported at this time.

Only the DOS and Unix versions of PGP 2.5 have been released so far.
The Unix version is in source code form, and so can be readily ported to
VMS, NeXT and many other operating systems.  A Macintosh version has yet to
be released. 



If you would like to see US export restrictions on cryptography removed,
please send a message supporting Rep. Cantwell's export reform act (bill
HR3627) to cantwell@eff.org, ask your Representatives to co-sponsor this
bill, and ask your Senators to co-sponsor Sen. Murray's companion bill
(S1846) in the US Senate.  Congress contact information is available from

Subject: EFF Urges Support for Brock Meeks Defense Fund
-------------------------------------------------------

The Electronic Frontier Foundation urges its members and supporters
to contribute to the defense fund for Brock Meeks, the online
journalist now being sued for his hardhitting reporting in
Cyberwire Dispatch. EFF is in touch with Meeks's attorneys, and
stands prepared to intervene in the case if critical First
Amendment issues arise as it develops.

As we enter a world in which users of the networks increasingly
are able to act as producers of information as well as consumers,
it is vital that we stand united against those who would use
litigation to chill the full expression of individual First Amendment
rights. Please read the Meeks Defense Fund alert below and contribute
a dollar (or more) to the vindication of freedom of speech on the Net.

Subject: ALERT: KEEP FREE AND OPEN SPEECH ON NET 
Date: Wed, 11 May 1994 13:38:30 -0400 (EDT)
From: Meeks Defense Fund <fund@idi.net>


 Dear Net Citizen:

 How do you put a price on free and open dialogue on the Net?

 How much are you willing to spend to preserve the concept of roboust
 and open debate that have become a part of the Internet's culture?
 $100? $50?  $20?

 What if the cost of helping to preserve an open and robust Net was
 no more than $1.29?  That's right, less than the cost of a fast
 food hamburger.  Freedom on the Internet for only $1.29... cheap
 at twice the price.

 A joke?  Hardly.  The free and open speech, indeed the First Amendment
 rights of the Internet -- rights we've all enjoyed for decades -- are now
 being challenged in court.

 CyberWire Dispatch, the well-respected online newswire written and
 developed for the Internet community by journalist Brock Meeks, is
 the subject of a libel suit.  CyberWire Dispatch has been at the
 forefront of bringing the Net community timely and insightful
 articles.

 This suit was highlighted in a _Wall St. Journal_ article (April
 22, page B1).  The subject of a Dispatch investigation is suing
 Meeks for simply doing what journalists in the traditional print
 medium have done since the founding of newspapers:  Print the
 facts and let the public decide the outcome.

 Brock and the Cyperwire Dispatch are examples of the "bottom up"
 journalism that charachterizes the Net, where anyone with a modem can
 compete with the traditional press.  Of course, most of us don't come
 to the Net with a lawyer in tow, or the resources to defend a legal
 action taken against us in courts located hundreds of miles from our
 homes.

 This libel action is one of the earliest cases of libel involving
 alleged defamatory statements published over a computer network.
 It raises the extremely important legal and policy issues.  It's impact
 may well determine how and to what extent anyone feels free to express
 strong opinions on the Net, wihtout being put at risk of legal action.

 It is crucial that Brock have a strong defense and that the principles
 that  come out of this case provide the maximum protection to the
 exercise of free and open speech as possible.

 CyberWire Dispatch is unique because it's distributed solely in
 electronic form.  A service for the Net community at large.  And
 all CyberWire Dispatch articles are free.  Meeks neither charges
 anyone for receiving them;  he gets paid nothing to write them.

 For all these efforts, he's being sued.  And being sued by a
 company with a large financial backing.  Meeks, on the other hand,
 has no such resources.  His attorney, Bruce Sanford of Baker &
 Hostetler is arguably the finest First Amendment lawyer in the
 U.S.

 And although he has agreed to represent Meeks at a reduced rate,
 the cost of defending against this unmerited suit will not be
 cheap.

 We have formed this committee to lend our support in helping him
 raise money for his legal defense.  And all we're asking you to
 send is $1.29.  That's it.  Why that price?  The math is easy: $1
 in an envelope with a 29 cent stamp applied.

 Who can't afford $1.29 to help save the great freedoms we all
 enjoy here today?

 Can you send more?  Of course.  Any contributions will be
 welcomed and accepted.  Tax deductible donations also are
 possible by following the instructions below.

 All money sent for Meeks' legal defense fund will be go to that
 purpose.  All the administrative services for administering the
 fund are being donated;  100% of your money goes to defer the
 legal costs of this case.

 You are encouraged to repost this message.  But please, we urge
 you to keep proper Net protocol in mind when reposting or cross
 posting this message.

 Thanks for your time.  On behalf of Brock and for future
 generations of electronic journalists, we appreciate your
 contributions and support.

Subject: IITF Privacy Working Group Request for Comments on Principles
----------------------------------------------------------------------

From: CMATTEY@ntia.doc.gov
Date: Wed, 04 May 1994 14:53:26 -0400
X-deadline: June 13, 1994!

[...]this is indeed time sensitive, and we want people to have ample
opportunity to review it and react.  Please disseminate it
however you think appropriate.

I hope it is not too confusing to publicize this document after
publicizing NTIA's Notice of Inquiry; people may wonder why there
are two separate bodies in government examining privacy issues.
Some background explanation for you: the Privacy Working Group
(part of the interagency NII task force) is trying to develop a
broad framework for dealing with privacy issues that span all
sectors of the economy, while NTIA (the Executive branch agency
specifically responsible for developing positions on
telecommunications policy) is examining privacy issues affecting
the telecommunications and media industries. [...] (I am involved in both
efforts, as I am NTIA's representative to the interagency Privacy Working
Group.  As such, I obviously am trying to make sure both efforts are in sync
with one another.)

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Information Infrastructure Task Force's Privacy Working
Group, chaired by Robert Veeder, Office of Management and
Budget
************************************************************


Request for Comments on the draft Principles for Providing
and Using Personal Information and their Commentary.

The draft Principles for Providing and Using Personal
Information and the associated Commentary are the first work
product of the Information Infrastructure Task Force's
Working Group on Privacy.  They are intended to update the
Code of Fair Information Practices that was developed in the
early 1970s.  While many of the Code's principles are still
valid, the Code itself was developed in an era when paper
records were the norm.  

The advent of the National Information Infrastructure has
caused two things to change dramatically.  No longer is
information usage bound by the limitations of paper -- the
seamless web of networks linking us to each other is
creating an interactive environment in which all of the
participants must share certain responsibilities. Moreover,
non-governmental usage rivals the government's, and is
largely unregulated.

The following Principles were developed with the goal of
providing guidance to all participants in this new
interactive world. The Working Group recognizes that the
Principles cannot apply uniformly to all sectors. They must
be carefully adapted to specific circumstances.
Nevertheless, the developers believe that the
responsibilities and relationships the Principles describe
are basic ones. As such, they are intended to assist
legislators, regulators, and companies as they develop codes
of practice. 

The Working Group invites public comment on the Principles
and Commentary. We are especially interested in
understanding how the Principles would work in this new
interactive electronic environment and particularly in non-
governmental settings. Are they workable?  How, if at all,
should they be changed?  We hope that those who obtain the
Principles for review and comment will also share them as
widely as possible with others who might be interested in
them.

The Comment period will close on June 13, 1994.  Comments
should be sent to the Working Group on Privacy c/o the NII
Secretariat, National Telecommunications and Information
Administration, US Department of Commerce, Room 4892,
Washington, D.C. 20230.  The Principles and Commentary can be
downloaded from the IITF Gopher/Bulletin Board System: 202-501-

               DRAFT: April 21, 1994          

Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information

Preamble

The United States is committed to building a National Information
Infrastructure (NII) to meet the information needs of its
citizens.  This infrastructure, essentially created by advances
in technology, is expanding the level of interactivity, enhancing
communication, and allowing easier access to services. As a
result, many more users are discovering new, previously
unimagined uses for personal information.  In this environment,
we are challenged to develop new principles to guide participants
in the NII in the fair use of personal information.  

Traditional fair information practices, developed in the age of
paper records, must be adapted to this new environment where
information and communications are sent and received over
networks on which users have very different capabilities,
objectives and perspectives.  Specifically, new principles must
acknowledge that all members of our society (government,
industry, and individual citizens), share responsibility for
ensuring the fair treatment of individuals in the use of personal
information, whether in paper or electronic form.  Moreover, the
principles should recognize that the interactive nature of the
NII will empower individuals to participate in protecting
information about themselves.  The new principles should also
make it clear that this is an active responsibility requiring
openness about the process, a commitment to fairness and
accountability, and continued attention to security.  Finally,
principles must recognize the need to educate all participants
about the new information infrastructure and how it will affect
their lives.

These "Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information"
recognize the changing roles of government and industry in
information collection and use.   Thus they are intended to be
equally applicable to public and private entities that collect
and use personal information.  However, these Principles are not
intended to address all information uses and protection concerns
for each segment of the economy or function of government. 
Rather, they should provide the framework from which specialized
principles can be developed.


I.  General Principles for the National Information              

    Infrastructure

A.  Information Privacy Principle

     1.   Individuals are entitled to a reasonable expectation of

          information privacy.

B.  Information Integrity Principles

Participants in the NII rely upon the integrity of the
information it contains. It is therefore the responsibility of
all participants to ensure that integrity. In particular,
participants in the NII should, to the extent reasonable:  

     1.   Ensure that information is secure, using whatever means 
          are appropriate;

     2.   Ensure that information is accurate, timely, complete,  
          and relevant for the purpose for which it is given.

II.  Principle for Information Collectors (i.e. entities that
collect personal information directly from the individual)

A.  Collection Principle

Before individuals make a decision to provide personal
information, they need to know how it is intended to be used, how
it will be protected, and what will happen if they provide or
withhold the information. Therefore, collectors of this
information should:

     1.   Tell the individual why they are collecting the         
          information, what they expect it will be used for, what 
          steps they will take to protect its confidentiality and 
          integrity, the consequences of providing or withholding 
          information, and any rights of redress.


III.  Principles for Information Users (i.e. Information
Collectors and entities that obtain, process, send or store
personal information)

A.  Acquisition and Use Principles

Users of personal information must recognize and respect the
stake individuals have in the use of personal information. 
Therefore, users of personal information should:

     1.   Assess the impact on personal privacy of current or     
          planned activities before obtaining or using personal   
          information;

     2.   Obtain and keep only information that could reasonably  
          be expected to support current or planned activities    
          and use the information only for those or compatible    
          purposes;

     3.   Assure that personal information is as accurate,        
          timely, complete and relevant as necessary for the      
          intended use;

B.  Protection Principle

Users of personal information must take reasonable steps to
prevent the information they have from being disclosed or altered
improperly. Such users should:

     1.   Use appropriate managerial and technical controls to    
          protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal   
          information.

C.  Education Principle

The full effect of the NII on both data use and personal privacy
is not readily apparent, and individuals may not recognize how
their lives can be affected by networked information.  Therefore,
information users should:

     1.   Educate themselves, their employees, and the public     
          about how personal information is obtained, sent,       
          stored and protected, and how these activities affect   
          others.

D.  Fairness Principles

Because information is used to make decisions that affect
individuals, those decisions should be fair.  Information users
should, as appropriate:

     1.   Provide individuals a reasonable means to obtain,       
          review, and correct their own information;

     2.   Inform individuals about any final actions taken        
          against them and provide individuals with means to      
          redress harm resulting from improper use of personal    
          information;

     3.   Allow individuals to limit the use of their personal    
          information if the intended use is incompatible with    
          the original purpose for which it was collected, unless 
          that use is authorized by law.

IV.  Principles for Individuals who Provide Personal Information

A.  Awareness Principles

While information collectors have a responsibility to tell
individuals why they want information about them, individuals
also have a responsibility to understand the consequences of
providing personal information to others.  Therefore, individuals
should obtain adequate, relevant information about:  

     1.   Planned primary and secondary uses of the information;

     2.   Any efforts that will be made to protect the            
          confidentiality and integrity of the information;

     3.   Consequences for the individual of providing or         
          withholding information;

     4.   Any rights of redress the individual has if harmed by   
          improper use of the information.

B.  Redress Principles

Individuals should be protected from harm resulting from
inaccurate or improperly used personal information. Therefore,
individuals should, as appropriate:

     1.   Be given means to obtain their information and be       
          provided opportunity to correct inaccurate information  
          that could harm them;

     2.   Be informed of any final actions taken against them and 
          what information was used as a basis for the decision;

     3.   Have a means of redress if harmed by an improper use of 
          their personal information.

Subject: EFF's Kapor Announces New Cyberspace TV Show
-----------------------------------------------------

From: mkapor@kei.com (Mitchell Kapor)


New Cyberspace TV Program

I am developing  a new program on cyberspace in conjunction with WGBH-TV,
PBS' Boston affiliate.  The show is intended to be a window onto the world
of computer networks for the television viewer, whose point of  view is
that the world of on-line communications is interesting because of what
people do there, not because of the digital plumbing which enables it.
We will be focusing on the human aspects of networking and the individual
and social aspects of being on-line.  Cyberspace will be portrayed as a
not-so-really strange territory after all, where all of us will
increasingly come to live and work.  My role is to guide people through
this new territory, introducing the audience to its native culture, its
scenic attraction, and its sights and sounds.

We assume our audience is motivated by curiosity to learn more about what
goes on in cyberspace, but we do not assume they are knowledgeable or, in
general experienced with it.  On the other hand, we will not trivialize the
subject matter by reducing it to a least common denominator.

We will give the show a look and feel which is approachable and
down-to-earth.  Interview guests and roundtable participants will be drawn
from the net community itself.   There will be plenty of demos of cool net
stuff from Mosaic, CU See Me, and other cutting-edge applications and
services.

We are taping two test shows in mid-June which will be shown in Boston and
other cities and hope to have some sort of national distribution (to be
determined) in the fall for a regularly scheduled program.  We are also
going to create a WWW server for the show, the segments of which will be
downloadable.  The server will be have on it additional material which
won't fit into the show format.


An Invitation:

We would like to include some video clips of net citizens expressing their
greatest hope and worst fear about the future of the net which we will edit
into an on-air piece for our regular feedback session.

It's important to me to have the voices heard (and faces seen) of people
already on the net.  This is an opportunity for those  of us who enjoy
appreciate the decentralized and democratic character to express that
sentiment to a mass audience.  I hope you'll take advantage of the
opportunity.


Guidelines:

Since an individual on-air clip will run at most 20-30 seconds, please keep
your statement succinct.

In shooting the clip, please feel free to pick a location which says
something about yourself, whether it's your computer, your pet, or the
great outdoors.

We can accept Quicktime movies, VHS cassettes,  or 8mm tapes.  If you
enclose a mailer, we will return your tape.   We can also pick up digital
submissions from any FTP site, etc.

Announcement

New OTA Study on Wireless Technology and the National
Information Infrastructure

     We are pleased to announce that the Office of
Technology Assessment's study of the implications of
wireless technologies for the National Information
Infrastructure (NII) was formally approved by our
Congressional Technology Assessment Board at its February
8th meeting.  The texts of the request letters for the
study, the press release from Representatives Brown and
Boucher, and the proposal for the study, which outlines the
issues we will be considering during the next 14 months, are
all available via ftp at otabbs.ota.gov.  Look in
pub\wireless\ for these documents.  Other study-related
documents will be posted as they become available.

     The objective of this study is to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the problems and promises of
integrating wireless technologies into the NII.  Wireless
technologies and systems--such as TV and radio broadcasting,
new personal communications services, and many kinds of
satellite communications--will form an integral part of the
NII, but the role they will play and the implications of
their widespread adoption are not yet clear.  In particular,
integrating the many wireless and wireline systems that will
comprise the NII will prove a difficult challenge for
Federal, State, and local regulators. Many factors,
including standards development, interconnection and pricing
arrangements, and differing industry regulation, must be
addressed before radio-based technologies and systems can
become an effective part of the NII.

     This study will:  identify and discuss the various
wireless technologies that could contribute to the
development of the NII, assess the barriers to greater or
more efficient use of radio-based systems, and explore the
economic, regulatory, and social implications of the
convergence of wireline and wireless technologies in the
NII.  The study will also present policy options addressing
relevant wireless/NII issues.

     Over the course of the study, we will try to talk to as
many people as we can in order to understand the wide range
of interests and concerns surrounding these complex and
difficult issues.  In addition, OTA will also conduct
several (as yet undetermined) workshops that will address
specific issues in more detail.  These meetings will be
announced as far in advance as possible. If you would like
more information, please feel free to contact the study team
at our project e-mail address, wireless@ota.gov.  Any
suggestions you may have for people we should talk to or
other sources of data and information will be greatly
appreciated.

Fr:  David Wye
     Project Director

Re:  First Advisory Panel Meeting for Wireless/NII study


     The first meeting of the Advisory Panel for OTA+s study of wireless 
technologies and the National Information Infrastructure (NII) will be held 
on May 12, 1994 from
9:00 AM-4:30 PM in the OTA conference center at 600 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, 
Washington, DC.  The meeting is open to the public, and you are welcome to 
attend as an observer, but only a small amount of time will be set aside for 
observer comments.

     The Advisory Panel is composed of 19 individuals chosen to represent 
the broad mix of stakeholder interests in this study.  A list of the members

     The purpose of the the Advisory Panel is to help the project staff 
understand the broad range of issues and concerns surrounding the deployment 
of wireless technologies in the NII, and to identify appropriate 
methodologies and strategies for analyzing these issues.  The panel will 
also help ensure that the final report is as balanced, accurate, and 
objective as possible.

Wireless Technologies and the NII
Advisory Panel Meeting Agenda

May 12, 1994

8:30-9:00 Coffee and Pastries

9:00-9:30 Opening Remarks

          Welcome to OTA:  Jim Curlin, Program Manager
          Administrative announcements:  Liz Emanuel, Office Administrator
          Plans for the day:  Rob Kling, Chair

9:30-10:45     Panel Introductions and Opening Statements (4 mins each)

10:45-11:00    Break

11:00-12:20    First Session:  Overall Context of the Study

     This study grew out of our belief that wireless technologies were not 
being adequately considered in discussions of the National Information 
Infrastructure (NII).  But even apart from the concept of the NII, 
telecommunication and information technologies of all sorts--including 
wireless--are advancing rapidly, forcing regulatory, economic, social, and 
technological changes. In this first session, we would like to examine the 
role and relationship of wireless technologies to the evolving 
communications infrastructure of the United States.

o Does the study include all the issues it should?  What topics are missing? 
 What issues are not so important?

o What specific characteristics or capabilities make wireless systems 
important for the NII?  Are wireless technologies different from other 
components of the NII? What special benefits can wireless offer? 
 Conversely, what special problems does wireless present for the development 
of the infrastructure?

o Do policies that are adopted for the NII need to be +technology neutral?+ 
 Is this approach possible or even a good idea?  Will this concept help or 
hurt wireless? Do current policies (NII) encourage or hinder the development 
of wireless?

12:20-12:30    Observer comments

12:30-1:30     LUNCH

1:30-2:45 Second Session:  Implementation Issues

     Wireless technologies being developed today will bring new 
services--voice, data, and video--to the marketplace.  Integrating these new 
technologies with existing services may be difficult in many cases, but may 
also offer significant benefits for expanding access to and providing 
competition for NII services.  In this session we would like to discuss the 
opportunities and economic and regulatory issues associated with the 
deployment of wireless technologies and services.

o What types of wireless applications are being developed?  How might 
education, health care, and the provision of government services benefit 
from the wider use of wireless?  How do consumers view wireless services 
today?

o What types of technologies are now being investigated in trials or in the 
lab that might contribute to the NII?  What are the implications for 
spectrum allocations?

o What does +interoperability+ mean in the context of wireless systems?  Is 
concern about the standards process for wireless justified?  Where and how 
should wireless and wireline interconnect?  What are the issues associated 
with using wireless with intelligent network concepts, computer network 
protocols, and other technologies first developed for wireline networks?

o What are the key regulatory issues associated with wireless technologies? 
 What are the implications of wireless for local loop competition?

2:45-3:00 Break

3:00-4:00 Third Session:  Implications of Wireless

     The widespread adoption of wireless technologies will affect peoples' 
lives in many ways--most of which are still unknown.  Some of the effects 
are unlikely to be noticed until the technology has been deployed widely. 
 The impacts that wireless technologies may have appear to fall into several 
broad categories:  ubiquity, mobility, access, control.  In this session we 
would like to explore how wireless technologies may affect peoples+ 
lives--at home and at work.

o How might wireless technologies affect personal or societal security? 
 Personal privacy and autonomy?

o What are the health effects of wireless technologies?  If there are 
uncertainties, what research needs to be done to answer remaining questions?

o How might wireless technologies change work or business organizations, and 
what might any changes mean for workers?

4:00-4:30 Wrap-up.  Final comments and last thoughts.

     What else do you think is important that we haven+t talked about today? 
 What is the one thing that we should remember?
     Suggestions for workshops or more in-depth study.

4:30      Observer Comments and Adjournment

Subject: Name Change for the "Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet"
----------------------------------------------------------------

EFF's tutorial, "Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet," has been renamed
"EFF's Guide to the Internet."  EFF recently signed a deal to have the
guide printed by MIT Press and sold in bookstores throughout the country. 
IDG Books, publishers of "Internet for Dummies" and the rest of the "...
for Dummies" series, expressed their concern that the name similarity
between the two guides would cause confusion to purchasers.  We agreed and
decided to change the name.  The print version of the guide will be called
"Everybody's Guide to the Internet" and should be available at a bookstore
near you by the end of the summer.  The ASCII text file version of "EFF's
Guide to the Internet" can be found at:

ftp.eff.org, /pub/Net_info/Guidebooks/EFF_Net_Guide/netguide.eff

Subject: Errata - Correction to EFFector 07.08 Ratcliffe Nat'l. ID article
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: godsdog@netcom.com (Mitch Ratcliffe)
Date: Wed, 11 May 1994 14:42:09 -0700

It has been pointed out that there is a factual error in the US Card story:
During the editorial process, the statement that NASA Ames carried out the
Clipper R&D was inadvertantly added to the story. NASA Ames did provide
R&D for the US Card project, but played no known role in the Clipper devel-
opment. Digital Media is sorry if this mistake caused any confusion.

Subject: Note About EFFector - New Frequency, What to Do If You Are Moving
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

EFFector is no longer bi-weekly.  Due to the fact that things are moving
rapidly, and there is more news that ever, EFFector will now be sent out
more frequently.  Whenever we have time-sensitive material, and/or enough
material for an issue of EFFector, a new issue will be released.  We hope
this will get news to you faster, allow us to include more information,
and keep the issue size down to something that most mail systems can
handle without any problem.

If you are moving or otherwise will be needing to unsubscribe from EFFector,
you can do so by sending a message with "unsubscribe effector-online" (no
quotes) to listserv@eff.org - IF you joined the EFFector mailing list by
subcribing via the listserv.  If you were manually added to the list
(which is most of you), you can unsubscribe by sending a request to be
removed from the list to eff-request@eff.org (a real person, not an infobot.)

Thank you, and hope to see you back on the list soon!  Note that if you
prefer, you may obtain EFFector from Usenet's comp.org.eff.news.

Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when
the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally
alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The
greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal,
well-meaning but without understanding."

  - Justice Louis D. Brandeis, dissenting, Olmstead v. United States,
    277 U.S. 479 (1928)

Who will decide how much privacy is "enough"?

The Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that individuals should be
able to ensure the privacy of their personal communications through any
technological means they choose.  However, the government's current
restrictions on the export of encrytion software have stifled the
development and commercial availability of strong encryption in the U.S. 
Now, more than ever, EFF is working to make sure that you are the one that
makes these decisions for yourself.  Our members are making themselves heard
on the whole range of issues.  To date, EFF has collected over 4800 letters
of support for Rep. Cantwell's bill (HR3627 - Sen. Murray's companion bill
is S1846) to liberalize restrictions on cryptography.  The bill will need
your vocal support to succeed.  We also gathered over 1400 letters
supporting Sen. Leahy's open hearings on the proposed Clipper encryption
scheme, which were held in May 1994.

If you'd like to add your voice in support of the Cantwell bill, send
email to cantwell@eff.org, Subject: I support HR 3627

Your letters will be printed out and hand delivered to Rep. Cantwell by EFF.

You KNOW privacy is important. You have probably participated in our online
campaigns.  Have you become a member of EFF yet?  The best way to protect
your online rights is to be fully informed and to make your opinions heard.
EFF members are informed and are making a difference.  Join EFF today!
