****************************************************************************

[3/17/95:
 Yet even more organizations have joined us.  Welcome aboard!

 Next week (Mar 23, 1995) the telecomm reform bill will be marked up in
 the Commerce committee.  If the Communications Decency Act is added to
 the reform bill as an amendment, it will be *very difficult to stop*.
 The result of this bill becoming a law will be to change the nature of
 the Internet as we know it.  The volume of information we take for
 granted will slow to a trickle.

 Win this battle, and we've won the fight for this year and stopped the
 bill.   Lose it and we'll be on the ropes in the Senate for the rest
 of the session.

 Only you can make the difference, and it will only take two minutes.

1. Contact Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD, Commerce Committee Chairman),
   Sen. J.J. Exon (D-NE, sponsor of the bill), and Sen. Bob Packwood (R-OR,
   Chairman, Communications Subcommittee).

   Note: although contacting your own Senators is important, these
   members hold the keys at this point in time.  If you want to contact
   your own Senators, that's great, but between now and Thursday Pressler,
   Exon and Packwood are the ones to focus on.

   Time is of the essence: *Phone calls* are best, faxes only partially 
   effective, email has the least impact.

   Urge them to keep S.314 from being incorporated into
   telecommunications reform legislation and to support Senator Leahy's
   efforts to explore alternatives to the Exon bill.  Follow the communique
   at the bottom if you need to.


2. Feel free to use the following communique:

   SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

	I'm a resident of _______.  Please support Senator Leahy's
	efforts to explore alternatives to S. 314.  Please keep S. 314
	out of the telecommunications reform bill, and remove S. 314
	from the fast track.

   	Thanks.


   See below for a brief description of Leahy's initiative. His letter 
   to CDT is in the VTW gopher. 

   Concern over S.314 is not limited to the U.S. Among many international
   expressions of support, two have stood out in the first two weeks.
   EF-Australia is a member of the growing coalition, and IndiaNet has
   circulated our alert widely. If you are not a citizen of the United States
   you can still express your concern. A sample message to Senator Pressler
   follows:

	Dear Senator Pressler:

	The Exon bill will cripple the U.S. portion of the Internet
	and thereby devastate the growing global information community.
	Internation commerce and social and political cooperation will
	suffer greatly. I urge you to refrain from incorporating S.314
	into any telecommunications reform legislation and to support
	Senator's Leahy initiatives to explore alternatives to S314.

   Both US citizens and non-US citizens should remember to be polite
   when speaking to legislators, even their own.

3. DON'T FORGET TO DROP A NOTE TO VTW@VTW.ORG to tell us who you contacted.
   (See below for FTN -> Internet emailing instructions.)
   We'll tally the results and feed them back to all participating
   organizations.  It's crucial we have this feedback, even if you just
   got a form letter, or a "thank you" to your phone call.

   Please, when you report back, tell us what state you are in!  This
   will help us track constituent calls, which are the most effective. 

4. Feel good about yourself.  You've just participated in democracy
   without leaving your seat. 

5. (Extra bonus activism)  Pass this alert to your friends, especially if
   they're in South Dakota, Nebraska, or Oregon.  These states need to
   have as much constituent contact with their Senators as possible.

   Also, you might send a thank-you note to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) for
   his continuing efforts on behalf of free speech and the free flow of
   information in cyberspace.  He can be reached at:

INTRODUCTION

Dear Net Citizens:

Legislation has been introduced before the Senate which would severely
restrict your freedom of speech, halt the free flow of information on
the net, and require all telecommunications carriers to censor your
public and private communications.

The "Communications Decency Act of 1995" (S. 314), introduced in early 
February by Senators Exon (D-NE) and Gorton (R-WA), would place 
substantial criminal liability on telecommunications carriers (including 
traditional telephone networks, Internet service providers, commercial 
online services such as America Online and Compuserve, and independent
BBS's) whenever their networks are used to transmit any material 
which is deemed indecent or harassing.  In order to avoid these penalties, 
carriers would be forced to restrict the activities of their subscribers 
and censor all public and private communications.

We must act quickly to stop the progress of S. 314.  The bill may soon 
be incorporated into Senate telecommunications reform legislation, which 
is currently being drafted by the Senate Commerce Committee.  The 
telecommunications reform bill may be introduced as early as mid March, 
and is expected to be considered on a fast track.  If S. 314 is included 
in this bill, it will be extremely difficult to change or remove and 
could pass quickly.

We are asking you to join us in urging key members of the Senate to 
prevent S. 314 from being included in Senate telecommunications reform 
measures and to hold open, public hearings on the issue.

*****************************************************************************

CURRENT STATUS OF S. 314/H.R. 1004

The bill was introduced on February 1, 1995 by Senators Exon (D-NE) and 
Gorton (R-WA).  It is currently pending before the Senate Commerce 
Committee (chaired by Senator Pressler (R-SD)).

No committee action has been scheduled as of March 9, 1995.

The telecommunications reform bill is scheduled for hearing starting
March 21, 1995.  It is possible that S. 314 will be folded into the
bill during markup next week.

H.R. 1004 (worded the same as S. 314) was introduced on February 21,
1995 in the House by Representative Johnson (SD) and has been referred
to the House Commerce and Judiciary committees.

No committee actions in the House have been scheduled as of March 17, 1995.

****************************************************************************

BACKGROUND

S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and harassment on 
telephone services to all telecommunications providers and expand 
criminal liability to all content carried by all forms of 
telecommunications networks.  The bill would amend Section 223 of the 
Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take 
steps to prevent minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext and 
criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate telephone lines.  

If enacted, S. 314 would compel service providers to severely restrict 
your online activities.  Your access to email, discussion lists, usenet, 
the world wide web, gopher, and ftp archives would be substantially 
reduced or cut off entirely. The bill would also force providers to 
closely monitor and pre-screen your electronic mail, and refuse to 
transmit any message or other content which may be considered to be 
indecent.

This bill poses a significant threat to freedom of speech and the free 
flow of information in cyberspace. The bill also raises fundamental 
questions about the right of government to control content on 
communications networks, as well as the locus of liability for content 
carried in these new communications media.  

Recently, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has requested the Center for
Democracy and Technology's Public Interest/Industry working group IWG
(Interactive Working Group) to explore other solutions to the problems
that S. 314 attempts to solve.  The working group must be allowed to
examine current legislation and explore technical alternatives that are
consistent with the First Amendment and the free flow of information.

We've received over 400 messages in two weeks, with our log showing 
over 700 letters, faxes, phone calls, and email messages (many people 
contacted more than one Senator. At least two respondents wrote all 19 
members of the committee!)  Of course many more people have probably
contacted Congress without sending that note to VTW.

Almost 200 messages went to Pressler, who may be getting the point.
His staff told one caller, "Why are you calling us? It's Exon's bill!"
(This is why phone calls to Pressler are so important.)

One citizen wrote to Senator Gorton, a co-sponsor: 
        "I, frankly, am amazed at the audacity of your proposed 
         bill. We are not children sir, nor do we need your 
         misplaced guidance in raising our children!"

Along the same lines, another wrote to his own Senator: 
        "While I am pleased, being an enthusiastic supporter of 
         anti-harassment legislation, with many of the provisions of
         this bill, I am frankly astounded and appalled with others."

Someone came up with metaphor that frankly we aren't clever enough to
have thought of: 
        "A few years ago, a tanker laden with a crude, noxious substance 
         ran aground in the virginal territories of the Alaskan coastline. 
         It poisoned the land and sea for many miles around.... We are now 
         faced with another 'Exon Valdez'...  a vehicle filled with crude 
         legislation, currently at risk of running ashore on our pristine 
         rights."

Finally, someone writing to Pressler spoke for all of us to all of us:
	"At a time when communications between ordinary citizens has
         been all but drowned out by the barrage of mass media, online
         communication has become the last bastion of real citizen           
         deliberation and has become the "public square" so to speak, 
         of the nation.  This bill would destroy this great experiment 
         in the rejuvenation of grassroots democracy.  Please do all
         you can to prevent its passage."

We are encouraged by the success so far of the campaign, and hope that
you take the time to participate at this crucial time.

Subject: EFF Legal Services Need Your Help: The Cyberspace Defense Fund
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the past couple of months, several legal cases have surfaced that
challenge the very heart of net communications.  The Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF), as always, is working to ensure that civil liberties
survive these challenges.

*  EFF has filed a lawsuit suing the State Department and the NSA,
   challenging the current law limiting the export of encryption as being an
   unconstitutional prior restraint on free expression.

*  EFF is filing an amicus brief in support of two California
   sysops convicted of obscenity charges in Memphis when a Tennessee 
   Postal Inspector dialed into their system and downloaded files.

*  EFF has found pro bono counsel for a BBS sysop and an outspoken
   critic of the Church of Scientology to fight against holding system 
   operators liable for the postings of their users.

But even with pro bono counsel, these cases can cost tens of thousands of
dollars in litigation-related expenses, such as long distance telephone
calls, court fees, fed-x charges, airplane tickets, copying, etc.  We need
YOUR help in our fight to protect civil liberties online!  EFF has 
started the Cyberspace Defense Fund to collect money for defending the 
net against such threats to free speech and privacy.

Let's stop these threats to the cyberspace before they spread.  Please 
send us your contribution -- $100, $50, $20, whatever you feel comfortable
giving -- to help us continue this important work.  Send your donation to:

Subject: Zimmermann, Borg, Ware to Receive EFF Pioneer Awards
-------------------------------------------------------------

FOURTH ANNUAL EFF PIONEER AWARDS ANNOUNCED

On March 29, at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference in
Burlingame, California, the Electronic Frontier Foundation will present
its Fourth Annual Pioneer Awards to three individuals who were judged to
have made significant and influential contributions to computer-based
communications or to the empowerment of individuals in using computers.
The 1995 Pioneer Award recipients are Philip Zimmermann, Anita Borg, and
Willis Ware.

Nominations for the Pioneer Awards were carried out over several national
and international computer-communication systems. from the fall of 1994 to
February 1995.   A panel of six judges selected the winners from these
nominations.

The Pioneer Award Recipients

Philip Zimmermann is the original author of PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy"),
public-domain encryption software that has become a worldwide standard for
e-mail encryption. Zimmermann has been an outspoken advocate of individual
access to powerful encryption tools, and PGP has been widely praised for
having made it impossible for governments to prevent individuals from
communicating with true privacy. The publication and wide dissemination of
this software and its extensive use on the Internet worldwide has
heightened public-policy debate about encryption, and it has crystallized
opposition to government policies grounded in distrust of citizen access
to true privacy. Zimmermann is the individual who has done the most to put
the power of encryption into the hands of individual citizens.

Anita Borg is the founder and keeper of Systers, an electronic mailing
list for women in computer science. As the result of Borg's efforts, her
list has become a major force for increasing the numbers and improving the
position of women in the computer science field. Although she is also
known for a number of technical contributions to the field of computer
science in the areas of fault tolerant operating systems and cache
performance analysis, she is particularly well-known among women in
computing for the Systers list. Prior to her development of the Systers
list, women in this field had tended to be physically isolated from each
other and rarely able to find even a few role models or others with whom
to share common experiences. Systers has done more to increase
communication among women in computer science than any other available
forum.

Willis Ware, now an emeritus staff member at the RAND corporation in Santa
Monica, California, has been at the forefront of computer-privacy issues
for decades. In 1972, he was appointed Chairman of the DHEW Secretary's
Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, which issued the
landmark report, "Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens."  This
report provided the intellectual foundation for the Federal Privacy Act of
1974. In June 1975, he was appointed by President Ford to the Privacy
Protection Study Commission created by the Privacy Act of 1974 and served
as vice chairman.  The Commission made a study of data banks, automated
data-processing programs, and information systems of governmental,
regional, and private organizations and reported its findings to President
Carter and the Congress on June 12, 1977. This report remains the most
extensive examination of private sector record-keeping practices.
Throughout his career, Ware has been both prescient and outspoken on 
public-policy issues relating to computers and privacy; he has played a
key role in bringing privacy concerns to the forefront of public policy.


Judges

This year's judges for the Pioneer Awards were: Mike Godwin, online
counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who coordinated the
judging process; Philip Elmer-DeWitt, senior editor of TIME; technology
analyst and editor Denise Caruso; Steven Levy, NEWSWEEK columnist and
author of HACKERS: HEROES OF THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION; technology writer
Paulina Borsook; and Bruce Koball, technologist and chair of Computers,
Freedom, and Privacy '93.

Subject: Scotland and Italy Crack Down on "Anarchy Files"
---------------------------------------------------------

Anarchists online were the target of two recent police actions, one in 
Scotland and one in Italy.  Scotland Yard is investigating net-based
anarchist dissidents allegedly using online media to advocate
anti-government violence, at least one of whom was arrested several
weeks ago by detectives from the UK's Special Branch police agency, on
charges of sedition - the first such case in the UK to involve
computer-mediated communications.  The suspect appears to have been a 
Scottish system operator, running a BBS called Terminal Boredom, which may 
have archived some of the publications of anarchist publisher Spunk 
Press, a voluteer-based collective (though Spunk itself does not know
the sysop, and says he is not directly associated with them).

A Computer programmer, activist, and editor for Spunk Press in Scotland 
and who conducts seminars on progressive activism and Internet basics, 
was recently targetted in the British press, and associated with the 
online anarchists under investigation. A highly questionable article in 
the UK _Sunday_Times_ by Adrian Levy and Ian Burrell (Mar. 5) accused
the Spunk editor (who prefers not to be named again due to negative 
publicity) of encouraging the use of computer technology for organizing
violent and illegal acts, as part of an online terrorist coalition, at 
an "anarchist campaign" last October (described by attendees rather as a 
conference on anarchist politics and online activism).

However, the Levy/Burrell article is both replete with errors (it refers 
in one place to FTP archive directories "booby trapped with viruses that 
attack the computers of unauthorised intruders" - an impossibility, as
any experienced Internet user would know) and remarkably biased (the article 
alleges that supposed 'anarchy files' encourage students to "take 
part in dirty protests and riots.") Additionally it makes many wild and 
highly unrealistic accusations of global anarchist conspiracy (led by 
"an intelligent and well-informed girl", a British student, according to 
another similar report.)  No relevant evidence or sources are cited.  

Spunk "maintains an archive of anarchist material at umich [the U. of 
Michican anonymous FTP site] and other sites. It includes historical 
documents, articles by the likes of Chomsky & Bookchin, the text of 
various anarchist magazines and, contrary to what the Sunday Times said, 
nothing about bomb-making or other [seditious material]", Mitzi Waltz, a 
technology writer and US member of Spunk, told EFF, adding that another 
member of the Spunk collective, in Italy, suffered a police raid on 
his political discussion BBS, BITS Against the Empire, Waltz disagreed
vehemently with the _Sunday_Times_ article: "I have met [the Spunk editor] 
and he's about the furthest thing from a terrorist you can imagine. I 
was at the conference referred to [in the _Sunday_Times_ article] also 
last fall in London. [We] led workshops on using the Internet for 
communications and networking. Basic stuff, like 'what's a BBS?'..."

Others involved with Spunk Press indicate that a previous article in the 
UK trade magazine _Computing_ also attacked Spunk, possibly slanderously.
Recently, _Computing_ was inundated with criticism of its report.
These articles appear to have been the inspiration for a series of 
similar, and even further removed from reality, mainstream press reports 
in Italy, which compare the events to the raid on BITS Against the Empire.

BITS Against the Empire, a computer bulletin board system run by Clinamen,
(a Rovereto, Italy social center) and providing communications services to 
users via Internet, Cybernet and FidoNet, was seized along with printed 
material and disks during a Feb. 28 police search of Clinamen.  The homes 
of a number of people associated with Clinamen were also raided that 
morning by the Carabinieri Anti-Crime Special Operations Group, who 
seized books, computers, diskettes, even diaries.  Some of those raided 
are allegedly associated with the Italian anarchist movement.  Only one, 
the sysop, Luciano Paccagnella, is directly associated with the BITS BBS.

To date, only some of the seized materials have been returned, and the 
BBS itself, other computers, and diskettes are still being held for further 
investigation.  No one has been arrested, but the individuals raided 
have been formally charged with terroristic subversion crimes, which 
carry severe penalities: 7-15 years in prison.  Paccagnella expresses 
skepticism regarding the likelihood that authorities really want him in 
prison for 15 years, reasoning he and the others charged are probably 
expected to be intimidated into plea-bargaining. "What they really want 
is clearly to scare us," he said.

A Clinamen press release noted wryly: "According to the authorities, the 
bulletin board's activities in pursuit of free communication and counter- 
information represent a danger to the democratic order...Clearly nobody 
has explained to them that hard disks and diskettes can be copied in a 
matter of minutes. Meanwhile, those facing prosecution, as well as the 
hundreds users of BITS Against the Empire BBS, must continue to wait as 
police computer experts work to uncover not only the DOS 'copy' command, 
but also that very dangerous information - from publicly available 
electronic journals, articles and academic essays on the social use of 
new technology, to publicly accessible electronic discussion groups - 
which has inspired the charge of subversive association with terrorist 
intent."

The BITS BBS carried a file index of materials available from the Spunk 
archive (though not the files themselves), as well as back issues of 
_Computer_underground_Digest_ (for which EFF itself is the main archive 
site), and other political and non-political text material (no software). 
It is currently unconfirmed whether there is a direct link between the 
BITS raid, the Scottish BBS raid, the apparent mainstream media campaign 
against the Spunk Press Collective, or the earlier Italian "BBS 
crackdown" (which was targetted, ostensibly at least, at software 
pirates, though a few victims of the raids suggest that the crackdown 
was entirely politically motivated.)  Paccagnella doubts there is any 
official connection between these events.

Those concerned about the Italian raids can send messages of support or 
requests for updates to Luciano Paccagnella at:

European Counter Network: Luc Pac, 45:1917/2.1
Cybernet: Luc Pac, 65:1400/6 (currently down)
Fidonet: Luc Pac, 2:333/412 (currently down)


This news is very disconcerting, particularly given the recent law passed 
in the UK greatly restricting Britons' rights of assembly, not to mention
other Parliament actions to negate the right of silence at arrest and
broaden police search and seizure authority, as well as statements by UK 
Minister of Parliament Chris Smith that the "findings" of the Scotland 
Yard investigation into alleged online anarchist "terrorists" shows "the 
need for international agreements to ban groups preaching violence from 
the information superhighway", as the _Sunday_Times_ article triumphantly 
paraphrased. MP Smith is also on record as supporting a ban on public 
use of encryption, unless it is "escrowed" so that government agents can 
decode encrypted messages and files, likely due to international 
lobbying efforts on the part of the US Administration to convince European 
and other governments to attempt to retard private-sector encryption 
market growth and to embrace Clipper-like surveillance schemes.
 
When governments cannot distinguish between a socio-political philosophy
denying governmental authoritarianism and actual conspiracy to commit 
terrorist crimes, no one's intellectual freedom is safe.

Subject: Bay-Area EFF Meeting, Mar. 31: Sovereignty of Cyberspace, CoS v Inet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is pleased to continue its series
of monthly `BayFF' meetings in the San Francisco Bay Area.  All EFF
members, guests, and the public are invited.

This meeting will be in Burlingame on March 31, 1995, at 7:30PM.  Our
meeting place is in the same hotel as the Computers, Freedom, and Privacy
conference, on the evening of the last day of the conference, with
their gracious assistance:

	Grand Ballroom
	San Francisco Airport Marriott Hotel
	Burlingame, CA
	+1 415 692 9100
	Drive US 101, exit East at Millbrae, turn right on Old Bayshore.

Richard Horning will speak on the recent Church of Scientology court
case, and the liability of system operators and communications
providers for the speech of their users.  Richard is a partner at
Horning, Janin & Harvey of San Francisco, and is representing Tom
Klemesrud, the BBS operator who was recently sued (with Netcom) by the
Church of Scientology.  The case highlights several important issues
including anonymity; the right to dissent and criticize; how
intellectual property protection is balanced with freedom of speech
and association; personal liability for online speech; liability for
the carriage of online speech; and the duty (or lack thereof) of
communications carriers to terminate controversial speech, or the
access of controversial speakers, upon request.

John Barlow will also speak on the sovereignty of Cyberspace.  John
is a professional Cognitive Dissident, co-founder of EFF, and frequent
commentator on Electronic Frontier and intellectual property issues.
It may well be that cyberspace is inherently a sovereign region, and
that those who do business there and interact socially in that
environment would do better to recognize it as such.  If cyberspace
were to declare its independence from all terrestrial governments, how
would they respond, how would we defend ourselves, and who would be
authorized to make such a declaration?

John will have just returned from Singapore, where he spoke about
freedom of expression in digital media, at the invitation of the
Government of Singapore.  Singapore is one terrestrial power that's
been exerting extravagant control over its corner of cyberspace.

There will be plenty of time for general and specific questions,
issues, discussion, meeting people, and socializing with frontier-
minded folks.

To learn about future monthly BayFF meetings, send email to
listserv@eff.org  whose first text line is  subscribe BayFF  .

We hope to see you on Friday the 31st!

Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

* S314
 
This harmful bill could pass in a matter of WEEKS, or be added to any 
legislation pending on the Senate floor, such as the Senate telecom
bill (if this happens, Sen. Exon's censorship language will be very
difficult to keep from passing and changing online communications
as we know them utterly and for the worse.
Business/industry persons concerned should alert their corporate govt. 
affairs office and/or legal counsel.  Everyone should write to their own 
Senators and ask them to oppose this bill, and oppose it's inclusion
in any other bills.  Explain, quickly and clearly, why this bill is 
dangerous, (see the first article in this newsletter for the main points
to bring up) and urge efforts to stop this legislation and to support Sen.
Leahy's proposal to see alternatives to this bill explored 
problems.  S314 is Sen. Jim Exon's "Communications Decency Act".

MOST IMPORTANTLY: EXPRESS THESE CONCERNS TO EXON, PACKWOOD & PRESSLER!
Contact Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD, Commerce Committee Chairman),
Sen. J.J. Exon (D-NE, sponsor of the bill), and Sen. Bob Packwood (R-OR,
Chairman, Communications Subcommittee).  mail, fax, phone, email or 
express in person your concise, calm, but firm concerns to these Senators
now holding the keys to the future of this dangerous legislation:

"If five years from now we [the FBI] solve the access problem, but
what we're hearing is all encrypted, I'll probably, if I'm still here, be
talking about that in a very different way: the objective is the same.
The objective is for us to get those conversations whether they're by an
alligator clip or ones and zeros.  Whoever they are, whatever they are, I
need them."
  - FBI Director Louis Freeh, clarifying statements that the FBI may seek
    legislation to ban strong encryption, in an Oct. 1994 interview with
    Steven Levy.

Ensuring the democratic potential of the technologies of computer-mediated
communication requires active participation in the political processes that
shape our destinies.  Government agencies, legislatures and heads of state
are accustomed to making decisions about the future of technology, media,
education, and public access to information, with far-reaching and
long-lasting effects on citizens and their lives, but are accustomed to
doing so with little input or opposition from anyone but the largest of
corporations, and other government representatives.

Now, more than ever, EFF is working to make sure that you can play an
active role in making these choices. Our members are making themselves heard
on the whole range of issues. EFF collected over 5000 letters of support
for Rep. Maria Cantwell's bill to liberalize restrictions on cryptography. 
We also gathered over 1400 letters supporting Sen. Leahy's open hearings on
the proposed Clipper encryption scheme, which were held in May 1994.  And
EFF collected over 90% of the public comments that were submitted to NIST
regarding whether or not Clipper should be made a federal standard. 
Additionally, EFF has worked for the passage of legislation that would
ensure open access to the information infrastructure of today and tomorrow,
and continues to provide some of the best online resources on privacy,
intellectual freedom, the legalities of networking, and public access to
government representatives and information.

You *know* privacy, freedom of speech and ability to make your voice heard
in government are important. You have probably participated in our online
campaigns and forums.  Have you become a member of EFF yet?  The best way to
protect your online rights is to be fully informed and to make your
opinions heard.  EFF members are informed and are making a difference.  Join
EFF today!
