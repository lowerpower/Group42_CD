Subject: State Dept. Responds to Bernstein/EFF Crypto Export Suit
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On May 1, 1995, the government filed its answer to the Plaintiff's
complaint in Bernstein v. State Dept.  That case, filed on March 23 
by Dan Bernstein and sponsored by EFF, challenges the government's 
classification of encryption as a munition and controlling export of 
cryptographic items as being an unconstitutional prior restraint on 
speech.  The only surprise regarding the government's response is that 
DoS didn't attempt to delay filing.  The answer alleges that the court 
has no jurisdiction to hear issues of national security, that individual 
defendants should be dismissed since they were acting within the scope of 
their authority, and that we failed to exhaust all administrative remedies.  

The government agencies also "have been unable to locate a copy of the
September 22, 1993, letter [from Bernstein]...or confirm that an appeal was 
submitted...." Since Bernstein is claiming that their failure to respond 
to that appeal is evidence of the uselessness of the administrative 
appellate process, they're probably frantically searching for that 
important document as you read this.  

The State Dept. answer (and other case documents) are on our site at:

gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Privacy/ITAR_export/Bernstein_case
ftp.eff.org, /pub/Privacy/ITAR_export/Bernstein_case/

Warning, of sorts: The State Dept.'s answer is a document of very 
thick legalese (even the attorneys working on Bernstein's behalf 
consider it extremely dull.)

------------------------------


Subject: Karn to Sue State Dept. Over ITAR First Amendment Violations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a letter from Phil Karn's attorneys to the Department of State
warning that Karn will file suit against State if it does not favorably 
and immediately respond in his pending appeal.

Karn, since 1993, has been attempting to seek export approval of a 
diskette of cryptographic sourcecode created as a supplement to Bruce 
Schneier's _Applied_Cryptography_ book.  Though the book is exportable, 
and the diskette contains nothing but an exact duplication of code 
already in the book,  Karn's Commodity Jurisdiction Request has been 
repeatedly denied.  The Administration maintains, unbelievably, that 
the source  code is somehow *not* the same, but that its translation to 
"machine-readable format" somehow imbues it with "value-added" qualities,
as if by magic.  [One surmises State may not have heard of scanners and
manual typing, which render any text "machine-readable."]

                                April 28, 1995


Mr. Thomas E. McNamara
Assistant Secretary
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs
Room 7325A
Department of State
Washington, DC  20520

Dear Mr. McNamara:

On December 5, 1994, we wrote on behalf of our client, Mr. Philip
R. Karn, Jr. of San Diego, California, to appeal the adverse
determination by Deputy Assistant Secretary Martha C. Harris with
regard to Mr. Karn's appeal of an determination by the State
Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls ("ODTC") in CJ case
081-94.  On February 28, 1995, we met with you and representatives of
the Department of Justice and the National Security Agency, to provide
additional information and explain our position.  We have not heard
anything more about this appeal since that meeting.

All relevant facts are known to the Department and to the interested
agencies.  While all of us recognize the importance of the issues
raised in this case, the issues are neither complex nor analytically
difficult.  As you know, it has appeared to us and to other observers
that the licensing delays that Mr. Karn and others who seek licenses
relating to cryptographic materials have experienced fit a pattern of
procrastination by federal agencies which appears to be based on the
publicly stated policy of the National Security Agency to attempt to
deter the further spread of strong cryptography as much as they can,
notwithstanding the fact that the technology at stake is already
widely available, as documented in our appeal.  In short, it continues
to appear that NSA is using the tactics of delay and
decision-avoidance in an effort to continue to chill the First
Amendment activities of Mr. Karn and others interested in
cryptography.

Mr. Karn has patiently attempted to comply with established procedures
throughout this matter.  His initial request for a Commodity
Jurisdiction determination was filed on March 9, 1994, and was denied
by ODTC on May 12, 1994.  That adverse decision was appealed to
Dr. Harris on June 7, 1994.  Dr. Harris affirmed the adverse decision
on October 7, 1994.  The issues involved had been pending before your
department since Mr. Karn filed his 1993 request for a commodity
jurisdiction determination on the book, Applied Cryptography.  In
short, the Executive Branch has had the issue in this case before it
for over a year.  We have repeatedly been assured that the matter is
receiving "high-level attention" and has generated significant
inter-agency discussion.

The continued delay in rendering a decision in this matter is
inexplicable except on the assumption that the Executive Branch
intends, by its inaction, to chill the activities of Mr. Karn and
others.  As you know from our earlier submission, the chilling effects
of this system of prior restraints lies at the heart of the
constitutional difficulties of the ITAR regime that have been
previously identified by the Department of Justice.

Please be advised that while we would prefer to obtain a decision on
our appeal from your office, we will not continue to wait for an event
that apparently will not occur.  Mr. Karn has requested that we seek
judicial review of this matter not later than June 15, 1995, whether
or not your decision has been issued.  We will take such action,
unless, of course, you render a favorable decision before that time.

                                        Cordially,

                                        Kenneth C. Bass, III
                                        Thomas J. Cooper

Subject: New Features at EFFweb - Govt. Server Index, Forsale/Wanted
--------------------------------------------------------------------

EFF's World Wide Web server at http://www.eff.org/ has been upgraded with
several recent features:

 * The EFF Government Server Index at http://www.eff.org/govt.html
   provides links to hundreds of governmental and government-related
   servers around the world from state and local information, through
   US and non-US federal servers, to UN and other multinational governmental
   bodies' online offerings.  Probably the most comprehensive index of its
   kind, the list is a volunteer effort, and updated frequently.
   EFF would like to thank Fred Bourgeois for his tireless efforts in 
   maintaining this list.

 * The For-sale/Wanted Page at http://www.eff.org/forsale.html
   EFF has some equipment to sell, and is also seeking particular
   hardware and software.  If interested in helping us unload some of
   this material, or if you or your company would like to donate or provide 
   non-profit discounts on some equipment, many thanks! Donors will be listed
   on the page if they wish - good advertising!

 * New Online Activism & Government Index at http://www.eff.org/pub/Activism
   A sneak preview of the shape of things to come at EFFweb.  A complete
   HTML index of the unique EFF Activism and Government FTP archive has
   been completed, with links to on-site and off-site relevant resources.
   Eventually our entire FTP/Gopher/WWW archive will be structured in this
   manner.  State one of the effort is already complete: most of our hundreds
   of directories now have text 00-INDEX file indexes.  The next stages are 
   beginning  soon (full descriptions of all files, and finally HTMLizing 
   of all indexes for WWW browsing.)  Many other directories also already
   have HTML partial indexes, and all of the HTML directory indexes can
   be found quickly from our site-wide Topical Index list at 
   http://www.eff.org/links.html in alphabetical order.

 * Simpler Archive Structure
   The FTP and WWW archives have been restructured to make finding the
   important files you need easier.  All directories formerly located under
   /pub/EFF/Policy/ (a.k.a. /pub/EFF/Issues/) have been moved to /pub/ (for
   example: http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Privacy/ is now 
   http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/; and ftp.eff.org, /pub/EFF/Issues/Legal/
   is now ftp.eff.org, /pub/Legal/).  This will make it easier to browse
   our site without missing our most important archives, and also gives
   you shorter, easier paths and URLs.  Note for those browsing from our
   Welcome Page at http://www.eff.org/ - pick "EFF Document & File Archives",
   then "EFF WWW-Enhance FTP Archive" to get to http://www.eff.org/pub/ the
   roundabout way.)  Links to the old directory locations are still valid,
   and will remain valid for several months.

------------------------------


Subject: Calendar of Events
---------------------------

This schedule lists EFF events, and those we feel might be of interest to
our members.  EFF events (those sponsored by us or featuring an EFF speaker)
are marked with a "*" instead of a "-" after the date.  Simlarly, government
events, such as deadlines for comments on reports or testimony submission, are
marked with "!" in place of the "-" after the date.

If you know of an event of some sort that should be listed here, please
send info about it to Stanton McCandlish (mech@eff.org)

The latest full version of this calendar, which includes material for
later in the year as well as the next couple of months, is available from:

Subject: Quote of the Week
--------------------------

"I think there are certainly going to be lots of debates about the
Internet.  My hunch is that the First Amendment rights are going to
prevail, and that in fact this is an astonishingly free country and pretty
much intends to remain that way, and the Internet will just be one more
expression of our freedom... I think [with encryption] you have a
different set of questions.  I think clearly no American wants terrorists
to be able to have a level of secrecy which enables them to organize ways
of killing people, on the other hand people do want the right to
confidentiality.  I think that is a very...that is going to take some
time to explore."

  - Speaker of the US House of Representatives Newt Gingrich in response
    to questions about free speech and crypto by Jeff Ubois at the opening
    ceremony for the Smithsonian institution WWW site, May 1995.

Disagree with Newt?  Think encryption is the 'same question' - a matter of
privacy and free speech?  Join EFF!

Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

* ITAR Export Restrictions on Encryption

The U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations classify encryption
algorithms and products as "munitions" (weapons of war), and the State 
Department and NSA thereby restrict distribution of encryption technology -
technology vital to the networking security and your personal privacy.
Companies making encryption products are forced to produce good versions 
for domestic use and crippled versions for export.  Or, more likely, to 
simply produce a crippled version, since maintaining two versions is 
often prohibitively expensive.  The ITAR export controls are the primary 
ace in the hole the Administration is using to push key "escrow" schemes 
such as Clipper.  Help EFF defeat the unconstitutional ITAR crypto export 
restrictions but supporting the EFF Cyberspace Legal Defense Fund, the 
fund fuelling the Bernstein v. Dept. of State case.

* The Exon Bill (Communications Decency Act)

The Communications Decency Act poses serious threats to freedom of
expression online, and to the livelihoods of system operators.  The
legislation also undermines several crucial privacy protections.

Business/industry persons concerned should alert their corporate govt.
affairs office and/or legal counsel.  Everyone should write to their own
Senators and ask them to oppose this bill.  Explain, quickly and
clearly, why this bill is dangerous, and urge efforts to stop this
legislation or remove it from the larger bill it is a part of.

S.652, the Senate telecom deregulation bill, now contains Sen. Exon's
"Communications Decency Act" (formerly S.314.)  The House version, even
more dangerous to system operators, is H.R.1004.

For more information on what you can do to help stop this dangerous
legislation, see:

ftp.eff.org, /pub/Alerts/s314_hr1004_s652.alert
gopher.eff.org, 1/Alerts, s314_hr1004_s652.alert
http://www.eff.org/pub/Alerts/

If you do not have full internet access, send a request for this action
alert to ask@eff.org.


* Find Out Who Your Congresspersons Are

Writing letters to, faxing, and phoning your representatives in Congress
is one very important strategy of activism, and an essential way of
making sure YOUR voice is heard on vital issues.

EFF has lists of the Senate and House with contact information, as well
as lists of Congressional committees. These lists are available at:
ftp.eff.org, /pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/
gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Issues/Activism/Congress_cmtes
http://www.eff.org/pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/

The full Senate and House lists are senate.list and hr.list, respectively.
Those not in the U.S. should seek out similar information about their
own legislative bodies.  EFF will be happy to archive any such
information provided.
