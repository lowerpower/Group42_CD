Subject: ALERT: 4 Internet Censorship Bills - Time Is Running out!
------------------------------------------------------------------

As you'll see in this issues' Newsbytes section, the Senate has shown its
willingness to pass unconstitutional bills that threaten YOUR privacy
and freedom of speech.  There are four more such efforts under 
consideration now.  Please act immediately on the action alert below.
You may be comforted by the idea that you don't need to act, because the
Supreme Court will overturn all of this stuff.  Don't be fooled.  The
Supreme Court *might* do that, if it's in a receptive mood and if anyone has
several million dollars to throw away pushing a test case through many years
of legal battles.  In the interim, the Internet as we know it in the US will
cease to exist, replaced by a national censorship network, while innocent
parties will be fined and imprisoned for "harassing" and "profane" material
they did not create.  If this sounds like a regime you'd be uncomfortable
living under, please, take the few minutes it will require to phone or
fax your Senator, or (if not a US citizen) the Vice-President, who is 
also the President of the US Senate.

[Note that this week is going to be a stressful one, as the Telecomm
 Reform bill is on the Senate floor and things are moving *very quickly*.
 We're trying very hard to minimize the numbers of letters we send out,
 and the size of the alerts.

 If you feel they're coming too fast and are thinking about unsubscribing,
 please consider waiting until the end of next week, when the traffic
 will die down again. -Shabbir]

THE LATEST NEWS

First there was the Exon/Gorton Internet Censorship bill.  Then, there
was the Dole/Grassley bill, which would criminalize "profane" speech
among other things.  Then came the Lott amendment, which would make
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) liable for the traffic of their
users.  Now, Sen. Dan Coats (R-IN) has announced his intention to
introduce his very own legislation.  Since obscenity is already
illegal, it's unclear what benefits Coats' legislation will bring.

However given the tradition of the Senate's attempts at restricting the
Internet (Exon/Gorton, Feinstein, Dole/Grassley, and Lott) it's
becoming clear that few people are taking the First Amendment into
account when drafting their legislation.

As you read this, the Telecommunications Reform bill is being debated
on the Senate floor.  The Exon/Gorton Internet Censorship language
is *in that bill*.

If the net as a whole doesn't do anything, the Exon bill will become
a reality.

Even if it's found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court several years
from now, the damage it will do in terms of BBS seizures and chilling
speech in the meantime will make online systems a very different and
sad place.

A few days ago we put out an alert asking people to call Congress and
Vice President Gore.  This generated significant support and we've
even seen Senator's offices take notice of the fact that lots of computer-
literate individuals are calling to point out the problems with the
Exon/Gorton bill.  

If you already called, *thank you*.  Your comments warmed the hearts of
several of us, who have been swamped trying to process all the mail
you sent.  You have done your country proud.  Just as heart-warming
have been the letters from those abroad, who took the time to email
(and even call!) Vice President Gore.  We hope we can return the
favor somehow someday.

However, many of us have not called or faxed.  If you haven't done so
yet, take a moment to do that now.  Make your voice heard in
Washington.  Remind the Senate, which is paying more attention now to
voters than it has in several years, that you care about this new
medium that enables us to communicate in such an unprecedented
many-to-many fashion.  Demand the *exact same* rights and
responsibilities for speech in the digital world as we expect in
print media, no more, no less.

WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW -- U.S. and non-U.S. citizens

The Telecomm Reform Bill currently includes the Exon/Gorton Internet
Censorship bill.  Leahy intends to offer a swap, to remove the Exon
language in exchange for his bill which advocates a study of the issue,
with an emphasis on the preservation of the First Amendment and
parental control.  The other proposals could become involved as well.

It is essential that the Leahy language be substituted for Exon's, and
therefore it is essential:

1. That all citizens call or fax their Senators as soon as possible.
   There is no time for written letters and email is too easily
   discounted or ignored. Non-U.S. citizens should contact Vice
   President Gore.  Note, if you decide to send a fax, you'll want to
   write an expanded version of the statement below.

   It's very important that you always be cool, collected, and polite.

   U.S. citizens:
	<call your Senators' offices, contact info below>
	"Hello, Senator ________'s office"
	"Hi, I'm a constituent and would like to register my
	 opinion on the Telecommunications Reform bill to the 		
	 Senator.  May I please speak to the technology staffer,
	 _________?"
	"Hold On please.  Alright, go ahead."

	"Please oppose the Exon/Gorton bill (Title 4 of the Telecomm
	 bill) and other bills for censoring the Internet.  Please
	 support the Leahy alternative (S714) which examines these
	 issues.  My name and address are ________."

	"Thanks for calling." 
	<click>

   Non-U.S. citizens:
        <call, fax, or send email to Vice President Gore>
        "Dear Vice President Gore,
 
	 The world looks to the United States as one of the leaders in
	 developing a Global Information Infrastructure.  Title 4 of
	 the Telecomm Reform bill and other Internet censorship bills
	 imperil that leadership.  Please work to remove them from the
	 Telecomm Reform bill (S652) and support Senator Leahy's
	 sensible alternative (S714).  I'm calling from ____________."


2. Send VTW a note telling us what you did. If you contacted your two
   Senators, send a letter to vtw@vtw.org with a subject line of
   "XX ack" where "XX" is your state.  For example:

	To: vtw@vtw.org
	Subject: OH ack

	I called my Ohio Senators and expressed my opinion.

   If you contact Senators outside your state, please let us know what
   state you're from.  

   If you contacted Vice President Gore, send a letter to vtw@vtw.org with
   a subject line of "gore ack".  For example:

	To: vtw@vtw.org
	Subject: gore ack

	I called VP Gore and expressed my opinion.  I'm from France.

   An automatic responder will return an updated contact tally.

3. Forward this alert to relevant forums on other online services and
   BBS's.  Check the letter you get back to see which Senators are
   underrepresented by citizen contacts. Forward the Alert to any
   friends and colleagues in those states.

4. If you haven't yet signed the petition to support Sen. Leahy,
   do so now at http://www.cdt.org/petition.html.  If you don't have
   WWW access, send mail to vtw@vtw.org with a subject line of 
   "send petition" for directions.

5. Congratulate yourself!  Your two-minute activism joins that of many
   thousands of others over the past two months.

* New Draft of Comm. Decency Bill - Update

As noted last issue, Sen. Exon, the Dept. of Justice, and some unnamed 
online service providers have attempted to fix the "bugs" in the 
Exon/Gorton Communications Decency Act, recently folded into the Senate 
telecom reform bill, S.652.  All in all, the amendment fixes only 
superficial problems, leaving the core faults of the bill intact.
Whether the DoJ or other lobbyists that worked on this draft have 
accepted is has not been confirmed, but Exon has adopted it.

Exon attempted to have his amendment added to the en blac amendments 
(the Chairman's mark) for quick and easy passage, but was headed 
off by Leahy, who objected, putting Exon back in the position of having 
to propose his new language as a separate amendment to be debated and 
voted upon.  Senate business concluded around 3pm, and that was that.  
The amendment, and Leahy's alternative, are expected to be debated
on Mon. or Tue.  It will probably be a serious floor battle - the 
unconstitutional provisions of Exon and possibly Coats v. the more 
reasonable and reasoned Leahy bill.

Another source erroneously reported that Exon's language was accepted as an 
amendment to the Senate telecom reform bill by unanimous consent.  Senate
staffers confirm that this did not occur.

The Exon legislation revised by this draft amendment will remain 
unconstitutional, as it still attempts to ban expression protected by the 
First Amendment.  Even the regulation of indecency has been limited by 
the courts to very narrowly defined circumstances - none of which apply 
to online media. Additionally, the new version introduces a new problem: 
It protects only large commercial service providers from more-restrictive 
state laws, leaving individuals, schools, non-profits, and other groups
open targets for state-level censorship.

Why any of this is important:  Exon's new revision is more "palatable" to 
some parties. If it is kept out of the bill, it will be easier to defeat 
the Exon language that currently resides in S.652, and have it replaced 
with Leahy's language.  If the new draft replaces the old Exon language, it
will be much more likely to pass and convincing the Senate to exise it in 
favor of Leahy's bill (S.714) will be more difficult.

The draft changes to the Exon bill, showing what was deleted and what was 
added, are available at:

http://www.eff.org/pub/Legislation/Bills_by_number/s652_051995_amend.draft

gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Legislation/Bills_by_number, s652_051995_amend.draft


* The Other Side of the Coin: Feinstein Bill v. Bomb Material Online - Update

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) proposed and got her amendment to the Senate 
Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention bill, S.735, of Sen. Dole.  The Feinstein
provisions "prohibit the dissemination of information on the making of 
explosive materials with intent or knowledge that such information will 
be used for a criminal purpose." Though the legislation does not directly 
mention the Internet, it is certainly drafted to apply to online media, 
and was inspired by what Feinstein perceives as tools for terrorism on 
computer networks. 

Sadly, we must report that not only was the amendment accepted, but the 
Terrorism bill passed.  Worse yet, it passed with the "roving wiretaps" 
section intact, calling for police wiretaps of entire areas 
simultaneously, so law enforcement can catch mobile members of the Four 
Horsement of the Infobahn ("drug dealers, organized crime, child 
molesters & pornographers, and terrorists").  This is pretty bad but is 
not yet a total disaster.  This bill has quite a long way to go before it 
becomes law, and there are many opportunities to head it off at the pass.

Also, the Feinstein provisions were watered down.  Rough analysis 
suggests that it is even constititional, and in actually does not 
illegalize anything that's not already covered by current law, making it 
worthless ego legislation that simply exists to attract publicity and 
further the sponsors' political agenda.  Don't take this as gospel however.
Neither EFF nor other organizations in the Stop314 Coalition have the 
full text of the bill as it passed yet, and have not yet been able to do 
a full and careful analysis of it.

The full text of the Feinstein *draft* can be found at:

http://www.eff.org/Bills_by_number/s735_95_feinstein_amend.draft
ftp.eff.org, /pub/Legislation/Bills_by_number/s735_95_feinstein_amend.draft
gopher.eff.org, 1/Legislation/Bills_by_number, s735_95_feinstein_amend.draft

NOTE: This is *not* the version that passed, but the original.  It's 
still a good read, if you enjoy horror stories.

There's plenty more to worry about from this and other anti-terrorism 
legislation, most of which proposes one or more unconstitional 
"solutions" to perceived problems, and many of which seek to expand, in 
some cases radically, law enforcement and intelligence wiretapping 
authority and abilities.  These bills, archived by bill number, are 
also available in the Bills_by_number directory at the sites above.


* Sen. Coats Gets in on the Act, Sen. Lott Takes a Bow

Catching the new wave, Sen. Daniel Coats (R-IN) has announced his own 
Internet-censoring legislation, which is expected to be proferred as an 
amendment to the Senate telecom reform bill, just like everyone elses.
Details of this amendment are sketchy, but expect the worst.  This 
represents the most Far-Right net censorship paradigm yet.  Sen. Lott
has stated that he will not be introducing his amendment to make the Exon 
legislation even worse (by stipping all liablity protections for system 
operators).  No reasons were given.


* Dole/Grassley Legislation No Longer a Draft - Introduced as S.892

A bill even worse than Exon's, a true unconstitutional nightmare, was 
introduced shortly after last issue of EFFector: "The Protection of 
Children from Computer Pornography Act".  This is not intended as an 
amendment to the telecom bill, but is stand-alone legislation.
The bill's been referred to the Judiciary Committee.

The *draft* version is available at:

http://www.eff.org/Bills_by_number/s892_95_bill.draft
ftp.eff.org, /pub/Legislation/Bills_by_number/s892_95_bill.draft
gopher.eff.org, 1/Legislation/Bills_by_number, s892_95_bill.draft

NOTE: This is *not* the version as introduced (we'll have that up in same
directory as s892_95.bill when available), though it may be identical.

------------------------------


Subject: Errata
---------------

Last issue, EFFector reported that:
>> Prodigy filed a motion for summary judgment, asking to be dismissed from
>> the case on the claim that Prodigy could not be held responsible for the
>> postings of its users.

Bill Schneck, Associate Senior Counsel for Prodigy corrected us:

>In fact, the ruling was issued in response to a motion for partial
>summary judgment made by the *plaintiffs*. Prodigy did not move for summary
>judgment.

We apologize for the error, and hope it did not confuse or inconvenience 
anyone.

Subject: Quote of the Week
--------------------------

"It's going to be an uphill fight...This will all come down to
the debate.  Tell people to call and write their Senators.   They need to 
know.  Now."
  - An aide for Senator Pat Leahy (D-VT), from _Cyberwire_Dispatch_ article
    by Brock Meeks, June 9, 1995.  Leahy strongly opposes the
    Communications Decency legislation and has offered a reasoned 
    alternative.

Find yourself wondering if your privacy and freedom of speech are safe 
when bills to censor the Internet are swimming about in a sea of of 
surveillance legislation and anti-terrorism hysteria?  Worried that in 
the rush to protect us from ourselves that our government representatives 
may deprive us of our essential civil liberties?
