Subject: ALERT: Exon Bill - Only a Few Hours Left in Senate; Please Act!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of the lastest news: The Exon bill will be considered by the full 
Senate very shortly - within a couple of hours at most.  Things do not 
look good.  This is the absolute last chance to make your calls to your 
Senator about this legislation.  To make matters worse, Exon and Grassley,
co-sponsor of Dole's even worse Internet censorship bill, have combined 
forces to introduce yet another censor-the-Net proposal.  Details are 
unknown at this time.

Seriously, everyone, it's do or die time.

THE LATEST NEWS

We've seen some great responses from several people who called their
Senators.  At one office, the receptionist figured out what the big
surge in phone calls was about (amazing powers of abstraction!) and
finished one caller's sentence for him.  Another person who wrote us
said he appreciated the list of Technology staffers, as it turns out
he actually knew one of them already!

In all seriousness, we're not out of the woods yet.  We've seen some
encouraging signs, but we're still on the dark side of this issue.  There
are more Senators with bills before Congress to censor the Internet than
there are co-sponsors of Leahy's bill.  This should worry you.  Friday
morning you may wake up and discover that the Senate has passed a law
against "indecent, filthy, lewd, and lascivious" expression on online
systems.

You will suddenly realize that even discussions of movies that might
fit the above categories (such as R rated films) are now subject to
criminal prosecution.  Things you would normally find in bookstores and
in print will never become available online.  Discussions about them
will become a strange dance of schizophrenia.

Imagine trying to discuss a book that everyone has read while trying to
talk around a part that's illegal to discuss online.  Consider that
even Andrea Dworkin's treatises against pornography could not even be
discussed because they contain arguments and descriptions of why
pornography is wrong within the book itself.

We have before us some very clear choices; they have been created for us
(and in some cases by us) by the last few years of the "mainstreaming
of the Internet".

We can simply oppose the bills that censor electronic expression.  This
will result in us being viewed as "out of touch" and "radicals" by the
Senate.  They have been indoctrinated with two years of the press
telling them that the Internet is a big red light district.  They have
been given their "mission" by the nation's voice, the press, and
they're now responding to it.

They'll pass an Internet bill alright, so they can go to their
constituents and say "Look what I did!  I helped clean up the
Internet."  In the end, we'll lose this fight.  People who simply
oppose popularly-perceived issues are labeled as "shrill" and ignored.

Or, we can support Leahy's bill (S 714) that would direct the
Department of Justice to do a study of whether or not such legislation
is even needed.  This is the hearing that the Exon bill never got.
This is a chance to drag these bills that are clearly unconstitutional
into the light of day and wither them with all the First Amendment
sunlight we can get into a Senate hearing room.  Most importantly,
this buys us time.

If we don't support Leahy, we'll get the Exon bill.  It's too hard for
legislators today to stand up and say they support the First Amendment
over "decency".

But wait!  "The Exon bill is unconstitutional", you say.  "It can't pass!"
I point out that if it's so obvious that it's unconstitutional, why are
all these Senators jumping on the bandwagon to support similar measures?

But wait!  "The Supreme Court will nullify it", you say.  Perhaps.
Odds are even pretty good.  But what will happen in the seven years it
takes to find a martyr to take their case to the Supreme Court?  How
many bulletin boards will be seized?  How many people will take on a
new habit of "not communicating", in a medium which has fostered more
many-to-many communication than has ever been seen before?

You can make the difference.  You can call your Senator first thing
Monday morning and tell he or she that you think this issue ought to
get a good long look before anything is legislated.  There's not likely
to be a vote in the Senate before Monday 5pm, so you have the whole day
to call.

[EFF Note:  That was then, this is now. Please don't delay even 1 minute
before phoning or faxing your Senators after reading this.  There is no 
more time left.]

The Telecomm Reform bill is on the floor right now.  Senators are debating
restrictions on your speech right now.  Shouldn't you pipe up, while
you still can?

________________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW -- U.S. and non-U.S. citizens

The Telecomm Reform Bill currently includes the Exon/Gorton Internet
Censorship bill.  Leahy intends to offer a swap, to remove the Exon
language in exchange for his bill which advocates a study of the issue,
with an emphasis on the preservation of the First Amendment and
parental control.

It is essential that the Leahy language be substituted for Exon's, and
therefore it is essential:

1. That all citizens call or fax their Senators as soon as possible.
   There is no time for written letters and email is too easily
   discounted or ignored. Non-U.S. citizens should contact Vice
   President Gore.  Note, if you decide to send a fax, you'll want to
   write an expanded version of the statement below.

   It's very important that you always be cool, collected, and polite.

   U.S. citizens:
	<call your Senators' offices, contact info below>
	"Hello, Senator ________'s office"
	"Hi, I'm a constituent and would like to register my
	 opinion on the Telecommunications Reform bill to the 		
	 Senator.  May I please speak to the technology staffer,
	 _________?"
	"Hold On please.  Alright, go ahead."

	"Please oppose the Exon/Gorton bill (Title 4 of the Telecomm
	 bill) and other bills for censoring the Internet.  Please
	 support the Leahy alternative (S714) which examines these
	 issues.  My name and address are ________."

	"Thanks for calling." 
	<click>

   Non-U.S. citizens:
        <call, fax, or send email to Vice President Gore>
        "Dear Vice President Gore,
 
	 The world looks to the United States as one of the leaders in
	 developing a Global Information Infrastructure.  Title 4 of
	 the Telecomm Reform bill and other Internet censorship bills
	 imperil that leadership.  Please work to remove them from the
	 Telecomm Reform bill (S652) and support Senator Leahy's
	 sensible alternative (S714).  I'm calling from ____________."


2. Send VTW a note telling us what you did. If you contacted your two
   Senators, send a letter to vtw@vtw.org with a subject line of
   "XX ack" where "XX" is your state.  For example:

	To: vtw@vtw.org
	Subject: OH ack

	I called my Ohio Senators and expressed my opinion.

   If you contact Senators outside your state, please let us know what
   state you're from.  Also, if your exchange with the Senate staff
   was anything but droll and boring, please let us know.  For example:

  	My Senator's receptionist said he's gone out for the day, to
	try and find a copy of the First Amendment.  He thinks it's
	a seditious idea and wants to know who started it.

   If you contacted Vice President Gore, send a letter to vtw@vtw.org with
   a subject line of "gore ack".  For example:

	To: vtw@vtw.org
	Subject: gore ack

	I called VP Gore and expressed my opinion.  I'm from France.

   An automatic responder will return an updated contact tally.

3. Forward this alert to relevant forums on other online services and
   BBS's.  Check the letter you get back to see which Senators are
   underrepresented by citizen contacts. Forward the alert to any
   friends and colleagues in those states.

4. If you haven't yet signed the petition to support Sen. Leahy,
   do so now at http://www.cdt.org/petition.html.  If you don't have
   WWW access, send mail to vtw@vtw.org with a subject line of 
   "send petition" for directions.

5. Congratulate yourself!  Your two-minute activism joins that of many
   thousands of others over the past two months.

* Feinstein/Lott Amendment to S.652 Requires Manadatory Cable Scrambling

Senators Lott and Feinstein introduced an amendment yesterday to the
Telecom Reform bill, S.652, requiring manadatory scrambling of audio and 
video for "adult" cable tv programming.  How this will affect other 
information and entertainment services, such as Internet service providers,
BBSs, etc., if at all, is unclear, but the language at first analysis 
appears to apply to "multi-channel video programming distributors" and 
should not directly affect online services.  The amendment did not 
affect in any way the Communications Decency (Exon bill) provisions of 
the Telecom Reform bill, but rather another section. The amendment 
passed, according to Senate staffers, 91-0.

The text of the amendment as it was passed by the Senate and folded into 
the bill is available at:

* Sen. Robb Calls for Study Too, but Also Calls for "Tags" System

Amendment 1271 to Senate Telecom Reform bill was proposed yesterday by 
Sen. Charles Robb (D-VA). This amendment was tabled June 12, 1995. A "Sense
of Congress" resolution to "encourage the voluntary use of tags" or
identifying marks or names for online materials that are sexually
explicit.  Like other tagging and rating schemes, this idea has a number
of serious flaws.  Unlike other proposed systems, the Robb amendment
calls for a centralized industry board to oversee labelling and
implementation of software to block access to labelled material, and
requires the Secretary of Commerce to publicize the tags.  The scheme
would be voluntary under this version of the Robb amendment.  Calls
for a study one year down the road regarding the tags' proliferation and
effectiveness. Some good points, some bad points.  Mostly bad.  Yet
another attempt to centralize the uncentralizable, ignores the global
nature of the net, and calls for a single rating system, the almost
guaranteed failure of which will likely be the basis for yet more
Internet censorship legislation a year from now.  The tabled resolution
curiously labels the Internet and BBSs "public information networks".

However, like Sen. Leahy, Robb calls for a study, and reconsideration,
rather than deciding like Exon, et al., that he's right and that's that.

When and if the amendment will be reconsidered is unknown to us at present.

Subject: Quote of the Day
-------------------------

"There are already laws prohibiting the promotion of hatred and we are
now considering new laws to establish limits on the use of the Internet
and other forms of communication in a way that might be harmful to us all."
  - Allan Rock, Canadian Minister of Justice, in response to a question
    regaring whether or not students should be censored from "unwanted
    exposure" to "extremist movements promoting anti-social behaviour"
    online.  From a virtual conference hosted by Canada's SchoolNet MOO
    forum, May 1995.  The second meaning one can infer ("...limits...
    harmful to us all") is really a delicious bit of double entendre.


Find yourself wondering if your privacy and freedom of speech are safe 
when bills to censor the Internet are swimming about in a sea of of 
surveillance legislation and anti-terrorism hysteria?  Worried that in 
the rush to protect us from ourselves that our government representatives 
may deprive us of our essential civil liberties? 

Join EFF!

Even if you don't live in the U.S., the anti-Internet hysteria will soon 
be visiting a legislative body near you.

------------------------------


Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

* The Exon Bill (Communications Decency Act)

The Communications Decency Act poses serious threats to freedom of
expression online, and to the livelihoods of system operators.  The
legislation also undermines several crucial privacy protections.

Business/industry persons concerned should alert their corporate govt.
affairs office and/or legal counsel.  Everyone should write to their own
Senators and ask them to support the replacement of Exon's 
communications decency language in the Senate telecom reform bill s.652 
with S. 714, Sen. Leahy's alternative to the Comm. Decency Act.  Explain 
quickly, clearly and politely, why you feel the Exon language is dangerous.

S.652, the Senate telecom deregulation bill, now contains Sen. Exon's
"Communications Decency Act" (formerly S.314.)  The House version of the 
CDA, H.R.1004, is essentially stalled.  The House telecom reform bill
will almost certainly include the Leahy language, a fact that may be 
worth mentioning to your Senators.

For more information on what you can do to help stop this and other 
dangerous legislation, see:

If you do not have full internet access, send your request
for information to ask@eff.org.


* Find Out Who Your Congresspersons Are

Writing letters to, faxing, and phoning your representatives in Congress
is one very important strategy of activism, and an essential way of
making sure YOUR voice is heard on vital issues.

EFF has lists of the Senate and House with contact information, as well
as lists of Congressional committees. These lists are available at:
ftp.eff.org, /pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/
gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Issues/Activism/Congress_cmtes
http://www.eff.org/pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/

The full Senate and House lists are senate.list and hr.list, respectively.
Those not in the U.S. should seek out similar information about their
own legislative bodies.  EFF will be happy to archive any such
information provided.  If you do not know who your Representatives are, 
you should contact you local League of Women Voters, who typically maintain
databases that can help you find out.


* Join EFF!
