THE LATEST NEWS

In the House, the Comm. Decency Act is not a part of the fast-moving
Telecommunications Reform Bill, *yet*. Althouth the Leahy/Klink alternative
is currently part of the telecomm bill, supporters of the Exon bill have
pledged to *remove* the Leahy/Klink bill and insert the Communications 
Decency Act in its place. 

We need to gear up to oppose the Communications Decency Act in the
House AND TAKE A COUNT OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES POSITIONS ON THIS
CRITICAL ISSUE.

The Leahy/Klink study would direct the Department of Justice (DOJ) to
determine whether current obscenity laws apply to the Internet and if
law enforcement can use them to prosecute people trafficking in obscene
material or child pornography.  (Trafficking in obscene material and
child pornography are not protected by the US Constitution.)

Of course, the answer to these questions is yes, and the DOJ said as
much in a letter to Senator Leahy on May 3, 1995 to Sen. Leahy (D-VT).

Currently, Representatives Cox and Wyden have introduced a bill (HR
1978, the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act) that would
remove disincentives to implementing parental control of online content
and *prohibit* the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from
regulating expression on the Internet.

Although many are concerned that this bill is not "all there", many
civil liberties organizations (ACLU, CDT, EFF, EPIC, & PFAW to name a
few) are contributing their legal and net-expertise to examining the
bill and making sure it does the right thing.

WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

1. Familiarize yourself with the Communications Decency Act FAQ,
   available either by World Wide Web at
   (URL:http://www.panix.com/vtw/exon), gopher at gopher.panix.com, or
   via email by sending mail to vtw@vtw.org with "send cdafaq" in the
   SUBJECT line. (not the body of the message)

2. Call your Representative (there is a list attached below) and ask them
   these questions.  The aim here is to get his or her take on net
   censorship.  Here's the way a sample conversation might take place:

   First, figure out who your Rep is.  (see the list of phone numbers below)
   (Y=You, S=Rep's Staffer)

   	<ring ring>
   	S:Rep. Snodgrass's office, may I help you?

   	Y:Hi, I'm a constituent and I'd like to know what Mr. Snodgrass's
	  position is on the issue of objectionable material on online
	  networks such as the Internet.

	  Does Mr. Snodgrass favor parental control over what kids see or
	  governmental censorship?

	S:Let me transfer you to the staffer that handles that, hold
	<hold>
	S:Hi, this is Jane Jingle.  May I help you?
	Y: <repeat above question>

   You'll probably get one of three answers, either:

	S:I believe that parents should have control over the information
	  their children see, not government regulators.
	Y:Thanks.  As a user of computer networks and a constituent, I
	  agree with Mr. Snodgrass and hope he will vote this way when
	  the relevant bills come to the floor. 

   or
	S:Mr. Snodgrass doesn't have an opinion on this issue yet.
	Y:Thanks.  As a user of computer networks and a constituent, I
	  support parental control instead of government censorship.  I
	  hope Mr. Snodgrass will vote this way when the relevant bills
	  come to the floor. 

   or, finally,

	S:Mr. Snodgrass believes that porn on the net should be made
	  illegal because it's a really big problem.

	Y:As a user of computer networks and constituent, I support
	  parental control instead of government censorship.  I hope
	  Mr.  Snodgrass is aware that trafficking in obscene material
	  is already illegal for online systems.

	  I also hope that Mr. Snodgrass is aware that there are a
	  number of technologies already on the market that allow
	  parents to control content on computer networks. I strongly
	  believe that Mr. Snodgrass and Congress shold trust parents
	  to make these choices.


   Take the response you get and mail it to vtw@vtw.org.  We'll be
   totalling up the responses and using them to help coordinate the
   pressure before a House vote.  Whether you are happy or unhappy with
   your legislator's response, we strongly encourage you to also post
   it and discuss it in your local geographical newsgroups.  Educate
   your fellow voters!

3. Encourage your bulletin board system or Internet service provider to
   reproduce the following short alert either in their Message Of The Day
   or in a quick bulletin to the other users.

	7/12/95: The Communications Decency Act (CDA) is in the House and
	discussion is heating up.  Volunteers are needed to call their
	Representatives and get their rep's positions on net censorship.
	To get more info, send mail to vtw@vtw.org with "send alert" in 
	the subject line, gopher -p 1/vtw/exon/alert gopher.panix.com, or
	URL:gopher://gopher.panix.com:70/00/vtw/exon/alert

4. Congratulate yourself!  You've not only told your rep what you think,
   but you've also helped the Coalition learn more about where your rep
   stands on this issue!

CHRONOLOGY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT

No more actions have been scheduled as of July 12, 1995.

Jun 30, '95	Cox and Wyden introduce the "Internet Freedom and Family
		Empowerment Act" (HR 1978) as an alternative to the CDA.
Jun 21, '95     Several prominent House members publicly announce their
                opposition to the CDA, including Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA),
                Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA), and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR).
Jun 14, '95     The Senate passes the CDA as attached to the Telecomm
                reform bill (S 652) by a vote of 84-16.  The Leahy bill
                (S 714) is not passed.
May 24, '95     The House Telecomm Reform bill (HR 1555) leaves committee
                in the House with the Leahy alternative attached to it,
                thanks to Rep. Ron Klink of (D-PA).  The Communications
                Decency Act is not attached to it.
Apr  7, '95     Sen. Leahy (D-VT) introduces S.714, an alternative to
                the Exon/Gorton bill, which commissions the Dept. of
                Justice to study the problem to see if additional legislation
                (such as the CDA) is necessary.
Mar 23, '95     S314 amended and attached to the telecommunications reform
                bill by Sen. Gorton (R-WA).  Language provides some provider
                protection, but continues to infringe upon email privacy
                and free speech.
Feb 21, '95     HR1004 referred to the House Commerce and Judiciary committees
Feb 21, '95     HR1004 introduced by Rep. Johnson (D-SD)
Feb  1, '95     S314 referred to the Senate Commerce committee
Feb  1, '95     S314 introduced by Sen. Exon (D-NE) and Gorton (R-WA).

Subject: EFF Analysis of the "Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act" (S.974)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


*****  FEEL FREE TO DISTRIBUTE WIDELY  *****

On June 27, Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) introduced the Anti-Electronic
Racketeering Act, S.974.  The bill was designed "to prohibit certain acts
involving the use of computers in the furtherance of crimes, and for other
purposes."  Its immediate effect, among other things, would be to
criminalize the posting of any encryption software on any computer network,
that foreign nationals can access (in other words, any computer network
period).  Because of poor wording, the bill would probably also criminalize
data compression and other non-cryptographic encoding schemes available on 
networks.  This includes the compression used in most of the images on 
Internet users' WWW homepages, not to mention uuencoding, binhex, MIME and 
other encoding methods for transferring binary files via email, and even 
language encoding used to represent non-English characters, such as the 
SJIS scheme for representing Japanese Kanji characters.

In addition, the bill seems to be directed at undermining two big fights
we've successfully waged in the past:  the Steve Jackson Games decision
against the United States Secret Service and the government's Clipper Chip
proposal.

Re:  Steve Jackson Games -- this bill would permit the government to avoid
the notice requirements of the Privacy Protection Act if "there is reason
to believe that the immediate seizure of such materials is necessary to
prevent the destruction or altercation [very Freudian sic!] of such
documents."  Furthermore, the government could use electronic evidence
seized that had not been particularly described in a warrant if:

"the seizure is incidental to an otherwise valid seizure, and the
government officer or employee-

   ''(A) was not aware that work product material was among the data seized;

   ''(B) upon actual discovery of the existence of work product materials, the
government officer or employee took reasonable steps to protect the privacy
interests recognized by this section, including-

   ''(i) using utility software to seek and identify electronically stored data
that may be commingled or combined with non-work product material; and

   ''(ii) upon actual identification of such material, taking reasonable steps
to protect the privacy of the material, including seeking a search warrant."  

Re:  Clipper Chip -- The bill would make it a crime "to distribute computer
software that encodes or encrypts electronic or digital communications to
computer networks that the person distributing the software knows or
reasonably should know, is accessible to foreign nationals and foreign
governments, regardless of whether such software has been designated as
nonexportable."  However, there is an exception:  "It shall be an
affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that the software at
issue used a universal decoding device or program that was provided to the
Department of Justice prior to the distribution."  This is essentially an
attempt to sneak the key "escrow" provisions of the Clipper scheme in
through a legislative back door.

Fortunately, the bill does not have a very promising future.  The bill has
no co-sponsors.  It was immediately referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary, where it currently sits.  LEXIS's bill tracking report only
gives it a 10% chance of passing out of the committee.

We thought Senator Grassley's own statement when he introduced the bill is
worth reading, so we attach it here.  Our favorite line is "Elliott Ness
needs to meet the Internet."  This is especially ironic in light of recent 
comparisons of hysteria about "dangerous" material on the internet, and 
the Prohibition.

The bill itself follows Grassley's statement.

------------------------------


Subject: Sen. Grassley's Statement to the Senate on S.974
---------------------------------------------------------

   Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce the Anti-electronic
Racketeering Act of 1995. This bill makes important changes to RICO and
criminalizes deliberately using computer technology to engage in criminal
activity. I believe this bill is a reasonable, measured and strong response
to a growing problem.  According to the computer emergency and response
team at Carnegie-Mellon University, during 1994, about 40,000 computer
users were attacked. Virus hacker, the FBI's national computer crime squad
has investigated over 200 cases since 1991. So, computer crime is clearly
on the rise.

   Mr. President, I suppose that some of this is just natural. Whenever man
develops a new technology, that technology will be abused by some. And that is
why I have introduced this bill. I believe we need to seriously reconsider the
Federal Criminal Code with an eye toward modernizing existing statutes and
creating new ones. In other words, Mr. President, Elliot Ness needs to meet the
Internet.

   Mr. President, I sit on the Board of the Office of Technology Assessment.
That Office has clearly indicated that organized crime has entered cyberspace in
a big way. International drug cartels use computers to launder drug money and
terrorists like the Oklahoma City bombers use computers to conspire to commit
crimes.

   Computer fraud accounts for the loss of millions of dollars per year. And
often times, there is little that can be done about this because the computer
used to commit the crimes is located overseas. So, under my bill, overseas
computer users who employ their computers to commit fraud in the United States
would be fully subject to the Federal criminal laws.  Also under my bill, Mr.
President, the wire fraud statute which has been successfully used by
prosecutors for many users, will be amended to make fraudulent schemes which use
computers a crime.

   It is not enough to simply modernize the Criminal Code. We also have to
reconsider many of the difficult procedural burdens that prosecutors must
overcome. For instance, in the typical case, prosecutors must identify a
location in order to get a wiretapping order. But in cyberspace, it is often
impossible to determine the location. And so my bill corrects that so that if
prosecutors cannot, with the exercise of effort, give the court a location, then
those prosecutors can still get a wiretapping order. And for law enforcers-both
State and Federal-who have seized a computer which contains both contraband or
evidence and purely private material, I have created a good-faith standard so
that law enforcers are not shackled by undue restrictions but will also be
punished for bad faith.

   Mr. President, this brave new world of electronic communications and global
computer networks holds much promise. But like almost anything, there is the
potential for abuse and harm. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this
bill and that is why I urge industry to support this bill.

   On a final note, I would say that we should not be too scared of technology.
After all, we are still just people and right is still right and wrong is still
wrong. Some things change and some things do not. All that my bill does is say
you can't use computers to steal, to threaten others or conceal criminal
conduct.

   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed
in the Record.

   There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record,
as follows:

Subject: EFF and Others Thank 16 Senators for Voting Against the CDA
--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Letter sent to the 16 Senators who voted against the Communications 
Decency Act.]


Dear Senator:

The undersigned organizations and individuals thank you for voting
against the Exon/Gorton amendment that would censor electronic
networks.  Only 16 of you upheld both the Constitution and the will of
the people (as clearly expressed through letters, phone calls, and
petitions) in opposing the amendment.  We will do whatever we can to
make the public remember your principles and your courage.

You understand that the censorship issue goes beyond the question of
whether a child sees a picture that is in bad taste.  You know that
censorship ends up suppressing what is good, valuable, and sometimes
critical to public policy-making.  Let us hope that the House of
Representatives is more open to this view.

We believe that electronic networks should allow all constitutionally-
protected forms of expression, that the commercial organization of the 
media should encourage a wide range of content providers, and that the 
privacy of online users should be diligently safeguarded.  Standards of 
propriety (which differ from community to community, and from individual 
to individual) should remain an individual decision on a medium like the 
Internet, which is truly the first expression of the emerging Global 
Information Infrastructure. When governments try to dictate content, we 
risk choking the life out of these vital communication, educational, and 
knowledge tools.

Finally, we applaud the Internet as a forum where people can defend free
speech in other media, and can organize to protect the civil rights of
everyone.  Attacks on the Internet could well be preludes to attacks
on these broader values.

Sincerely,

* Organizations

Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

* The Communications Decency Act

The Communications Decency Act poses serious threats to freedom of
expression online, and to the livelihoods of system operators.  The
legislation also undermines several crucial privacy protections.

Business/industry persons concerned should alert their corporate govt.
affairs office and/or legal counsel.  Everyone should write to their own
Representatives and ask them to support Rep. Klink's alternative 
legislation, already folded into the House telecom reform bill, and 
ask their legislators to oppose any efforts to remove the Klink 
language from the bill and replace it with the CDA or similar 
censorship legislation.  Explain, quickly and clearly, why the CDA is 
dangerous, and urge efforts to prevent its introduction in any form.

For more information on what you can do to help stop this and other 
dangerous legislation, see:

ftp.eff.org, /pub/Alerts/
gopher.eff.org, 1/Alerts
http://www.eff.org/pub/Alerts/

If you do not have full internet access, send your request
for information to ask@eff.org.


* The Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act

This bill is unlikely to pass in any form, being very poorly drafted, and 
without support.  However, the CDA is just as bad and passed with flying 
colors [the jolly roger?] in the Senate. It's better to be safe than sorry.
If you have a few moments to spare, writing to, faxing, or calling your
Congresspersons to urge opposition to this bill is a good idea. If you 
only have time to do limited activism, please concentrate on the CDA instead.
That legislation is far more imminent that the AERA.


* Find Out Who Your Congresspersons Are

Writing letters to, faxing, and phoning your representatives in Congress
is one very important strategy of activism, and an essential way of
making sure YOUR voice is heard on vital issues.

EFF has lists of the Senate and House with contact information, as well
as lists of Congressional committees. (A House list is included in this
issue of EFFector). These lists are available at: 
ftp.eff.org, /pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/
gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Issues/Activism/Congress_cmtes
http://www.eff.org/pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/

The full Senate and House lists are senate.list and hr.list, respectively.
Those not in the U.S. should seek out similar information about their
own legislative bodies.  EFF will be happy to archive any such
information provided.

If you are having difficulty determining who your Representatives are,
try contacting your local League of Women Voters, who maintain a great 
deal of legislative information.
