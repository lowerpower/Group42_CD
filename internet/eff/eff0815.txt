We apologize for any downtime or net troubles users of our sites may have 
experienced, and for delays in turn-around time on information requests
and membership applications. We're working on catching up with the 
several weeks worth of backlog incurred during our transition time.

Though we are now back up and running full-time and full-on, we do not 
yet have permanent office space. When this last piece of the puzzle is 
resolved, we'll inform everyone of the change again.

Nothing serious appears to have occurred during our downtime (Congress 
being in recess probably had a lot to do with that...)

Thanks to our members and the online community for your continued support 
and action!

THE LATEST NEWS

The House and Senate have passed a total of four different pieces of
legislation aimed at dealing with children's access to information on
the Internet.

Each of the four was profiled in BillWatch #13 which you can retrieve
from URL:http://www.vtw.org/billwatch/issue.13.html.  Here are the four
pieces of legislation and a short summary of each of them.

HR1978: "Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act" (Cox/Wyden) This
bill takes the approach of encouraging industry to provide parents with
tools to restrict their childrens' access to the net.  It contains no
new criminal provisions.  This approach was affirmed by the House
421-4 on August 4, 1995.  (Yes, that's a landslide)

S314: "The Communications Decency Act" (Exon/Coats) This bill makes
many types of constitutionally-protected speech (including lewd,
lascivious, and indecent speech) criminal when used through a
telecommunications device.  This provision was affirmed by the Senate
84-16 on June 14, 1995.

House amendment to HR1555: "Child Protection, User Empowerment, and
Free Expression in Interactive Media Study Act" (Klink/Leahy) This bill
directs the Department of Justice to study and see if there are places
in current law where existing obscenity laws are unenforcible on computer
networks.  This approach was affirmed by a committee voice vote.

House amendment to HR1555: <unnamed>  This amendment was submitted at
the last minute through the Manager's Mark, a collection of several
amendments to HR1555 that were voted on as a block.  This amendment
takes constitutionally-protected speech and criminalizes it when it is
expressed online.  Most legislators had no idea that they voted on this
last amendment; the summary of the Manager's Mark did not mention
these new criminal provisions.  There was no applicable House vote on
*just this* provision.

The House-Senate conference committee now has the task of deciding
which of these are allowed into the final Telecommunications Deregulation
bill for the last floor vote.

________________________________________________________________________

WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

1. It's crucial that we tell Congress how their decision in the conference
   committee will affect businesses and bulletin boards in cyberspace.

   Read the electronic business and bulletin board letter below.  You
   can also find it at:

	Gopher:  gopher -p1/vtw/exon gopher.panix.com

	Email  : Send mail to files@vtw.org with "send cdaletter" in the
		 subject line.
	
2. If you work for a business that uses bulletin boards or public networks,
   convince the owners to sign onto the letter.  Companies that should sign
   this include Internet service providers, Web designers (big and small),
   Internet consultants and trainers, Internet restaurants and bars,
   software companies that develop Internet-related software, companies
   that advertise or publish through the Internet or bulletin boards, writers
   who publish through the Internet, and many others!

   If you belong to a bulletin board, ask the sysop if he or she will sign
   onto the letter.

3. Ask the BBS sysop or the business owner to mail in the following
   information to vtw@vtw.org:

	Business name
	Owner or officer name
	Address
	Email address
	Phone number
	Description of business and anything else relevant

LETTER FOR ELECTRONIC BUSINESSES AND BULLETIN BOARDS

(Do not send this letter in.  Simply follow the instructions at the top
 for signing your business or bulletin board onto it.)

Dear member of Congress,

Laws restricting Internet speech, such as S314, the Exon/Coats
"Communications Decency Act" and the new Title 18 language in the
Managers Amendment to HR1555, will not help parents control their
children's access to objectionable material and will over-regulate
electronic businesses out of this growing industry.

These bills are currently in the Telecommunications Deregulation
conference right now, and we urge you to provide your input to the
conference committee to remove the criminal provisions mentioned
above from the final bill. 

Recently the House addressed the issue of children accessing
controversial material in cyberspace.  By affirming HR 1978 (the
Cox/Wyden Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment bill) they encouraged
workable and successful solutions to helping parents control their
children's access to the Internet while showing a concern for the First
Amendment.

Unfortunately Congress also passed two measures that do nothing to help
parents control their childrens' access to controversial material on
the Internet.  S314, the Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act, and the
new additions to Title 18 of the US Code were drafted without an
understanding of the technology or the business that we engage in.

This legislation imposes regulations on business so grave that many of
us wonder if we will be able to stay in business.

The great advantages of modern electronic communications--and the
reason why we can stay in business delivering these communications--are
speed and openness.  In short, the new media allow millions of people
to exchange information freely at speeds approaching that of light.
The bills we object to will force many sites to screen every message
that comes across, or to shut down access.  We ourselves are at some
risk of violating the law, simply because we cannot police every page
that comes across our channels.

Should the laws proposing new regulations pass, the National Information
Infrastructure will be crippled, and many fewer organizations will be
willing to purchase our services.

Let it be understood that objectionable material is available to
children right now on sites outside the United States and will continue
to be available to children if these changes to the criminal code
pass.  Legislation that attempts to criminalize such information will
do nothing to affect information that sits on foreign soil, far from
the reach of US laws.

What will help parents control their children's access to the Internet
is "parental control" tools and features, such as those provided by
several major online services and available as over-the-counter
software.  Unlike many other parental schemes, these solutions are here
today.  No one had to mandate them, they appeared because parent
consumers asked for them.  A list of them is attached for your
information.

Once again, we urge you to express your opinion to the conference
committee.  The Telecommunications Deregulation bill that comes back to
the floor for a vote should contain HR1978 and exclude S314 and the new
Title 18 language from the HR1555 Managers Amendment.

Respectfully submitted,

<your name and business>

LETTER FOR PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NON-PROFITS

(If you want your organization to signon to this letter below, simply print
 it out and sign it.  This letter is not being centrally coordinated.)

Dear Member of Congress,
 
The undersigned represent a diverse coalition of [state] organizations and
associations based in [state] that are dedicated to free speech and privacy
values.  We write today to express our strong opposition to online
censorship legislation.  In addition to being unconstitutional, online
censorship legislation will unnecessarily stifle a promising new
communications medium -- cyberspace.  We urge you to oppose any effort to
censor online communications in violation of the First Amendment or to
impose a federal regulatory scheme on online content. 
 
As you know, the House and Senate have now passed two different
telecommunications deregulation bills (S 652 and HR 1555) that contain two
different versions of online speech crimes legislation.  Both versions pose
a severe threat to the First Amendment and to online services because they
impose significant criminal penalties for the online transmission of
"indecency."  Indecent speech, unlike obscenity, is fully protected by the
First Amendment. 
 
The Senate version (Senator Exon's "Communications Decency Act") inserts
new speech crimes into the communications section of the federal code and
puts the FCC in charge of online content.  The House version (passed as
part of the larger Managers Amendment to HR 1555) amends the obscenity
provisions of the criminal code to outlaw indecent speech over online
networks.  This fall, a conference committee will consider the differences
between the two telecommunications bills.  We urge you to provide your
input to the conference committee to remove these speech crimes provisions
from the final version of the telecommunications bill. 
 
We believe it is important to emphasize -- and to promote -- the remarkable
capabilities of interactive technologies.  Cyberspace is probably the
richest source of creative, diverse, empowering, and democratizing
communication ever to connect people statewide, nationwide, and globally. 
It is perhaps the world's first true "mass media" because it allows anyone
with a few simple tools to communicate their ideas to thousands of persons
at once.  It inspires tolerance and promotes mutual understanding by
connecting people of all ilk around the world.  Its vast databases, created
by the nation's finest universities, libraries, civic organizations and
industries, provide an invaluable educational resource.  It is a tool for
community organizing and citizen involvement. 
 
[People from state] -- like other citizens around the globe -- are going
online in record numbers, both at home and at work.  Interactive
communications have created a wealth of [state] business opportunities, for
established businesses and for entrepreneurs.  [State] libraries and
universities continue to contribute valuable databases to the Internet, and
to serve as log-in stations for people who don't have computers at home. 
The world-renowned [state] arts community is using online networks as a
powerful new creative tool and as a new way to reach audiences outside of
[state]. 
 
All the innovation and citizen empowerment inspired by online
communications, in [state] and around the world, is threatened by online
censorship legislation. 
 
To advance the truly amazing accomplishments of interactive technology, the
undersigned organizations believe that any legislation that affects the
emerging online environment must: 
 
EMPOWER USERS -- INCLUDING PARENTS -- TO MAKE PERSONAL DECISIONS ABOUT
ONLINE CONTENT. 
The right to decide what children should see and hear is uniquely personal
to the family -- government should have no role in dictating such personal
and private matters.  User-controlled screening programs provide
alternative ways to protect access by children to certain material without
infringing on the free speech rights of adults. 
 
PROTECT THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS. 
Any effort to establish federal control over constitutionally protected
speech must be opposed outright.  It is especially inappropriate to
restrict adult content in order to protect children when less restrictive
methods are available. 
 
SAFEGUARD PRIVACY IN ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS. 
Neither private companies nor local law enforcement officials should be
given carte blanche to read private e-mail or to create transactional
records of the habits of online users. 
 
PRESERVE A DEMOCRATIC, DECENTRALIZED NET. 
The online industry has blossomed without government control over content. 
Allowing the FCC or any other government agency to determine appropriate
content would stifle the diversity and flow of online speech and virtually
destroy the promise of the Net. 
 
Conclusion 
We ask that you oppose any legislation that fails to adhere to the above
principles.  In the words of House Speaker Newt Gingrich who spoke out
against the Communications Decency Act, "It is clearly a violation of free
speech and it's a violation of the right of adults to communicate with each
other."  Online communications continue to empower [state] citizens and to
stimulate [state] business.  We hope you will support this progress by
urging the conference committee to remove any online censorship provisions
from the final version of the telecommunications bill. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
[list of organizations, with addresses]

Subject: Quote of the Day
-------------------------

"Our problems are not new. We must not sign away our freedom and our reason
to make things even easier for the [politicians]. The only cure for bad
information is better information. You are in charge now; use your power
wisely."
  - Jon Carroll, "I Have Met the Enemy. I Have Bad News", _San_Francisco_
    _Chronicle_, June 29, 1995.

Find yourself wondering if your privacy and freedom of speech are safe 
when bills to censor the Internet are swimming about in a sea of of 
surveillance legislation and anti-terrorism hysteria?  Worried that in 
the rush to make us secure from ourselves that our government 
representatives may deprive us of our essential civil liberties? 
Concerned that legislative efforts nominally to "protect children" will 
actually censor all communications down to only content suitable for 
the playground?

Join EFF!

Even if you don't live in the U.S., the anti-Internet hysteria will soon 
be visiting a legislative body near you.  If it hasn't already.

Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

* The Communications Decency Act & Other Censorship Legislation

The Communications Decency Act and similar legislation pose serious 
threats to freedom of expression online, and to the livelihoods of system 
operators.  The legislation also undermines several crucial privacy 
protections.

Business/industry persons concerned should alert their corporate govt.
affairs office and/or legal counsel.  Everyone should write to their own
Representatives and Senators, asking them to oppose Internet censorship 
legislation, and (when the list is available) everyone should write to 
the conference committee members to support the reasonable approaches of 
Leahy, Klink, Cox and Wyden, and to oppose the unconstitutional proposals of
Exon, Gorton and others.

For more information on what you can do to help stop this and other 
dangerous legislation, see:

If you do not have full internet access, send your request
for information to ask@eff.org.


* The Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act

This bill is unlikely to pass in any form, being very poorly drafted, and 
without much support.  However, the CDA is just as bad and passed with 
flying colors [the jolly roger?] in the Senate. It's better to be safe 
than sorry. If you have a few moments to spare, writing to, faxing, or 
calling your Congresspersons to urge opposition to this bill is a good 
idea. If you only have time to do limited activism, please concentrate 
on the CDA instead. That legislation is far more imminent that the AERA.


* Find Out Who Your Congresspersons Are

Writing letters to, faxing, and phoning your representatives in Congress
is one very important strategy of activism, and an essential way of
making sure YOUR voice is heard on vital issues.

EFF has lists of the Senate and House with contact information, as well
as lists of Congressional committees. (A House list is included in this
issue of EFFector). These lists are available at: 
ftp.eff.org, /pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/
gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Issues/Activism/Congress_cmtes
http://www.eff.org/pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/

The full Senate and House lists are senate.list and hr.list, respectively.
Those not in the U.S. should seek out similar information about their
own legislative bodies.  EFF will be happy to archive any such
information provided.

If you are having difficulty determining who your Representatives are,
try contacting your local League of Women Voters, who maintain a great 
deal of legislative information.
