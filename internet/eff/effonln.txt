HOW TO FIND EFF ONLINE

construction", as are many of our forums on various online services, and that
new material is added frequently, so you may wish to check back periodically.


Internet and USENET:
--------------------

News Services and Forums for Discussion:

If you receive any Usenet newsgroups, your site may carry the newsgroups
comp.org.eff.news and comp.org.eff.talk. The former is a moderated
newsgroup for announcements, newsletters, and other information; the latter
is an unmoderated discussion group for talk and debate on EFF and issues
relating to the electronic frontier and civil liberties. Also, Usenet's
alt.politics.datahighway may be of interest.  This conference was started by
EFF in November of 1993, to provide a forum for discussion of the national
(or global) information infrastructure, from deployment plans to civil
liberties issues to debunking of hype.

For those unable to read the newsgroups, there are redistributions via
electronic mail, as well as other EFF mailing lists: 

comp-org-eff-news
        News-->mail gate of newsgroup comp.org.eff.news, EFF releases only.

HELP
LONGINDEX
in the body of your message to listserv@eff.org. 

Please note that comp-org-eff-talk can be high-volume at times, so you are
advised to use filtering.

Those in FidoNet and some other BBS networks can probably get the newsletter
and other low-traffic lists via gateway systems.  Ask your network
and echomail coordinators for more information.

File Archives:

A document library containing all EFF news releases and other publications
of interest, including John Perry Barlow's history of EFF - "Crime and
Puzzlement," as well as recent and proposed legislation, materials for
online activists, archives of electronic publications, records of trials
and legal cases, information alerts, and other related documents & papers,
is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.eff.org. Send a note to
ftphelp@eff.org if you have difficulties or are unable to use FTP.
If you are on the Internet, you can use your host's FTP program to
connect to ftp.eff.org (192.77.172.4).  Login as "anonymous" and use your
e-mail address as the password.

This archive may also be accessed via Gopher, and World Wide Web (Lynx,
Mosaic, Cello, etc.) services, at gopher.eff.org, and http://www.eff.org/,
respectively.  These utilities present documents and other files in
hierarchical, easy-to-navigate menus, allowing you to read online, and save
what you want to disk on your own machine.  If you don't have access to a
gopher client, but do have access to telnet, you can use another site's 
gopher client by telnetting to consultant.micro.umn.edu, login: gopher.
From there, select "Other gopher servers", then "North America", "USA", 
"Washington DC", "Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)".  There are a
couple of new e-mail servers for accessing gopher sites - start
off by sending mail with a subject and message body of "help" (no quotes) to
gophermail@ncc.go.jp or gophermail@calvin.edu.  SunSITE offers several
public services via telnet login. These include: gopher (login: gopher),
World Wide Web (login: lynx - select g http://www.eff.org/ to get to EFF), 
WAIS - over 500 databases (login: swais).

When completed, Wide-Area Information Server (WAIS) database indexing of the
EFF archives will be available at wais.eff.org via Internet.

From time to time, EFF-oriented resources may appear on other systems; for
instance, Illuminati Online's Metaverse service will feature an EFF
"virtual office", while FidoNet locally gates both comp.org.eff.talk and
comp.org.eff.news.  If you have difficulty finding online material from the
listed sources, try shopping around and you may find what you are looking
for.  All EFF materials are redistributable, and can be found on many BBS
systems around the country.  System operators interested in carrying our
material should contact ask@eff.org (Internet), Stanton McCandlish at
