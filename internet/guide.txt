                                    Introduction




            The growth of National Science Foundation  Network  (NSFNET)
            in  the last few years has brought the benefits  of network-
            ing to researchers at hundreds of academic,  government  and
            industrial  sites.   Network  users  have improved access to
            research tools, and there are greater possibilities for col-
            laboration  among  members of the research community. But in
            order to take  maximum  advantage  of  more  widespread  and
            improved  connectivity,  users  have  to  be  aware  of  the
            resources that are available to them.

            When the NSF Network Service Center (NNSC) began to  publish
            the  "Internet  Resource  Guide"  in  1989,  our goal was to
            increase the visibility of the resources that are accessible
            via NSFNET and other parts of the Internet. We have depended
            on the population of resource providers on the  Internet  to
            furnish us with the information for the guide.

            We have just finished an extensive update  of  many  of  the
            entries  to  the Internet Resource Guide.  We hope that this
            new November 1992 edition of  the  printed  version  of  the
            guide will inspire its readers, many of whom surely maintain
            resources we haven't yet mentioned, to  submit  descriptions
            of their resources for the guide.

            If you wish to submit a new entry to the  Internet  Resource
            Guide,  send a message to "resource-guide@nnsc.nsf.net", and
            we will send you a template and instructions  for  preparing
            your entry.



                       How to Use and Maintain This Guide...



            Using the Guide...

            The Internet Resource Guide is  intended  to  help  Internet
            users  learn  what  services on the network are available to
            them.

            Each  service  is  listed  in  a  separate  section,   which



            November 10, 1992           NNSC         Introduction Page 1








            describes  the  resource, explains who can use the resource,
            how the network is reached via the Internet and  lists  con-
            tacts for more information.

            To  assist  users  trying  to  find  a  particular  type  of
            resource,  similar  resources are grouped into chapters. For
            example, Chapter 1 lists all the special computing resources
            on the Internet, including supercomputer centers and centers
            for parallel computing. Thus, users interested in finding  a
            supercomputer  to work on can browse through the sections in
            Chapter 1, in search of  a  supercomputer  center  that  can
            accomodate  their needs. Users interested in locating a par-
            ticular service can check the  tables  of  contents  at  the
            start of each chapter.

            The resource guide is indexed in WAIS (the Wide Area  Infor-
            mation   Server   system),   which   can   be   accessed  on
            quake.think.com, nnsc.nsf.net, and many other Internet  host
            computers. Telnet to the host computer, and login as "wais".


            Maintaining the Guide...

            The resource guide is designed to be kept  in  a  loose-leaf
            notebook,  to  make  it  easy  to add or replace sections of
            text. Users can add new sections  to  their  collection,  or
            replace  the  existing  sections,  with updated entries. The
            guide is also designed to be stored on a host computer, with
            each section in a separate file.

            The guide is distributed electronically by the NNSC. To  get
            on one or more of the distribution lists for the guide, send
            a note to "resource-guide-request@nnsc.nsf.net".

               o+  The "text" list receives a Text (ASCII) copy  of  each
                  new or updated entry in an email message.

               o+  The "PostScript" list receives a  Postscript  copy  of
                  each new o updated entry in an email message.

               o+  The  "ftp"  list  receives  announcements  of  new  or
                  updated  entries  that are available for anonymous ftp
                  on nnsc.nsf.net.

            Please specify which list or lists you prefer.  (The text in
            both  the  Text  and  PostScript  versions is the same;  the
            Postscript version is generally easier to read, but it  can-
            not be read on-line or searched by computer, unless you have



            November 10, 1992           NNSC         Introduction Page 2








            a computer uses PostScript for its screen display.)


            For More Information...

            For more information  about  the  Internet  Resource  Guide,
            including  instructions for obtaining the guide by anonymous
            ftp, send a message to "info-server@nnsc.nsf.net", with  the
            following text in the body of the message:

            The Cornell Theory Center at Cornell University  is  one  of
            four  National  Advanced  Scientific  Computing Centers sup-
            ported  by  the  National  Science  Foundation.  The  Theory
            Center's  resources  have  been  used  by  more  than  5,000
            researchers in fields as diverse as  aerospace  engineering,
            economics,  and  epidemiology.  Its  staff  offers technical
            expertise in  software,  visualization,  vectorization,  and
            parallel  processing  to  its  users,  and investigates new,
            highly parallel processing resources for the scientific com-
            munity in order to increase the usability of these computers
            through systems development and through examination of tech-
            niques  to  improve  performance. A variety of education and
            training programs are also offered to high school, undergra-
            duate, and graduate students, and their professors.

            The Theory Center, through its  Cornell  National  Supercom-
            puter Facility (CNSF), provides a world-class supercomputing
            environment that includes traditional  vector-scalar  super-
            computing  resources, in addition to scalable, parallel sys-
            tems. Theory Center  resources  were  recently  upgraded  to
            include a single six-way IBM ES/9000-900 supercomputer (with
            2.66 Gflops peak  aggregate  performance,  9  Gbytes  shared
            memory).  An important feature for many users who now access
            1 Gbyte of virtual memory is  that  each  user  process  may
            access  up  to  2  Gbytes  of virtual memory on the ES/9000.
            Parallel resources  at  the  Theory  Center  include  a  32-
            processor  KSR1,  the  32-processor  Parallel  Visualization
            Server (PVS) and a Scalable Cluster  of  RISC  Systems.  The

            KSR1 is a scalable parallel system manufactured  by  Kendall
            Square  Research  and offers 1.28 Gflops peak aggregate per-
            formance, and a 1 Gbyte shared memory and 1000 Gbyte address
            space per processor.

            The Theory Center is a  national  center  of  expertise  for
            IBM's PVS and the visual programming interface Data Explorer
            (DX). The PVS is a  parallel  computer  that  implements  DX
            across  32  processors using a large global memory, and per-
            forming up to 2.5 Gflops.  This  processing  speed  combined
            with the portable, user-friendly DX software allows an enor-
            mous range of performance levels with no change in  function
            for  the  user.   The same DX is available, for example,  on
            the Center's Scalable Cluster of RISC Systems (SCRS),  which
            consists of multiple RS/6000 workstations connected via high
            speed networking.

            This RISC Cluster is  being  used  for  multiprocessing  and
            parallel  computing. The cluster presently consists of eight
            model 550s, each with at least 128Mb of memory and all  run-
            ning AFS (Andrew File System).  PVM is available to affect a
            message- passing parallelism.  For those with X-capable dev-
            ices,  the  Center  has a PVM workbench to facilitate use of
            the cluster.  Express will also be  available  in  the  near
            future.

            In addition to the production operating  environments,  full
            support for communications across the NSFNET is provided via
            TCP/IP.   Interprocess  communications,   including   remote
            logins,  FTP  file  transfer,  and X Window System, are sup-
            ported.  FORTRAN is the primary language, and  is  supported
            in  scalar,  vector,  and  parallel  modes, with interactive
            debug  and  execution   analysis.    Scientific   subroutine
            libraries  are available, including vectorized and parallel-
            ized versions.  Online HELP facilities, UNIX man pages,  and
            a  Cornell  set  of  TUTOR  examples assist users.  Graphics
            software supports both local hardware and remote facilities.
            Several  well-known  application  packages  and  a  list  of
            software are available upon request.

            The Ohio Supercomputer Graphics Project is a major component
            of  the OSC's program.  The Project has developed a graphics
            visualization toolkit, apE,  for  displaying  and  animating
            results  of  scientific  computation  on  several  supported
            workstations.   This  developing  product  is   commercially
            available through the Center.

            The Ohio Visualization Laboratory (OVL) houses hardware  for
            visualizing  scientific results of projects conducted on the

            The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)  is  one  of  five
            national  supercomputer  centers  funded  primarily  by  the
            National Science Foundation.   Its  mission  is  to  provide
            supercomputer  time to scientists and researchers around the
            country.  SDSC is located on the campus of the University of
            California at San Diego and is administered by General Atom-
            ics.  Major policy guidance comes from a steering  committee
            representing  the  25  SDSC  consortium  institutions, which
            include major California universities and  all  campuses  of
            the  University  of  California  and  the  California  State

            The Center for Experimental Research in Parallel Algorithms,
            Software  and  Systems  (CERPASS)  provides  an experimental
            facility for researchers on the Internet.

            The Center's parallel computing resource includes a  Connec-
            tion Machine CM-2 and a Symult Series 2010.

            The Connection Machine Model CM-2 is  a  massively  parallel
            SIMD  machine.  Its hardware consists of 16,384 data proces-
            sors interconnected via a hypercube network.  Each processor
            has  a bit-serial ALU and a 64K-bit local memory.  This CM-2
            has two front-end subsystems - one VAX 6210 and one  Symbol-
            ics  3600,  a  5-Gigabyte  mass storage system and a graphic
            color display device.  Half of the machine (i.e., 8,192 pro-
            cessors)  is  also equipped with floating-point accelerator.
            Programming languages  available  on  this  machine  include
            *Lisp, C* and Paris interfaces to Commonlisp and C.

            The Symult S2010 is a  message-passing,  distributed  memory
            MIMD  machine.   Its  hardware  consists of 32 computational
            nodes.  Each node has a 32-bit Motorola 68020 microprocessor
            as  its  CPU, augmented by the Motorola 68881 floating-point
            coprocessors.  Each node has 8MB local memory, and  is  con-
            nected  with  other  nodes  via a high-speed message-routing
            network (GigaLink).  This machine uses  a  Sun-3  front-end,
            and  can  be  programmed  in  C  and  the parallel extension

            education, and research in North Carolina  institutions  and
            to foster the economic development of North Carolina through
            high-performance computing and its applications.   The  pri-
            mary  focus  of NCSC is to promote economic growth, computa-
            tional science  and  education  in  North  Carolina  through
            cooperative agreements with industry and research collabora-
            tions with academic institutions at all levels.  NCSC  is  a
            division  of  MCNC,  a non-profit company. NCSC offers high-
            performance computing on the following platforms:


            Cray YMP8/464   128 MWords SSD         62 GBytes of disk storage
            Convex C220     128 MBytes of memory   10 GBytes of disk storage


            An IBM 3090-180J provides  mass  storage  services  for  the
            Center  using  Unitree. The Center's computers are connected
            via a high-speed UltraNet network.

            The NCSC  visualization  lab  includes  a  Silicon  Graphics
            4D/280  GTX with stereo display, UltraNet network interface,

            32 megabytes of memory and 8 gigabytes of  disk  storage;  a
            Sun  4/490  with 64 megabytes of memory and 7.3 gigabytes of
            disk storage; a DECStation 5000/200 PXG-Turbo with 96  mega-
            bytes  of  memory  and  850 megabytes of disk storage; and a
            Stardent Titan 3040 P3 G3 with four processors, 64 megabytes
            of  memory  and  2  gigabytes  of disk storage. The lab also
            includes a NeXT computer with  color  monitor,  a  Macintosh
            IIci  with  color  monitor, a Kodak XL7700 color printer, an
            optical scanner, a film recorder, two commercial-grade  com-
            ponent  video recorders, a video digitizer, a scan converter
            and a digital frame store, and a  multi-format  video  tran-
            scoder.

            NCSC was chosen as the site of the International AVS  Center
            in 1991.  Two of the International AVS Center's goals are to
            broaden the user base and the functionality  of  Application
            Visualization  System, the current "de facto" standard visu-
            alization environment, and to be vender-neutral. The  Inter-
            national  AVS  Center  plans to reach this goal by fostering
            discipline-specific AVS module  development  and  developing
            new  uses  for  AVS.  The International AVS Center collects,
            ports and distributes  user-contributed  public  domain  AVS
            modules  and  serves  as a liason between AVS users and ven-
            dors. The International AVS center manages an  International
            AVS  Users Group to work with users from around the world to
            form local user groups.

            NCSC provides user support through e-mail and telephone con-
            tacts;  it  also provides training courses on a wide variety
            of supercomputing  topics.  NCSC  has  a  complete  training
            facility  with  lecture facilities, video taping capability,
            and a hands-on training laboratory populated with 16  works-
            tations.  NCSC  is a partner in the VISTAnet project, a com-
            ponent of the NREN project sponsored by the National Science
            Foundation.  NCSC  is installing a HIPPI based internal net-
            work for high-speed visualization and mass storage services.
            The  Research  Institute  within NCSC pro- motes interdisci-
            plinary and computational approaches to challenging problems
            through collaboration with industrial and academic partners.

                            Chapter 2:  Library Catalogs


            A large number of libraries allow access  to  their  library
            catalogs via the Internet.  Such catalogs can be very useful
            for finding uncommon books not available at a local library.
            Once  a  book  is  located, it can often be borrowed by your
            local library through Interlibrary  Loan.   Another  popular
            use of library catalogs is to check citations or references.
            Many catalogs also support more extended  reference  facili-
            ties.

            Please note that  on-line  catalogs  often  have  a  limited
            number of ports. Users are asked not to abuse their access.

            We would like to acknowledge the considerable assistance  of
            Ron Larsen, Art St.  George, and Joe St. Sauver in compiling
            this section.

            The MELVYL catalog is a computer-based  library  catalog  of
            over  7 million unique book titles representing more than 11
            million holdings of all libraries in the nine-campus UC sys-
            tem  and the California State Library.  The catalog contains
            records of book and periodical (serial) holdings, and  other
            materials  such  as  maps,  films, musical scores, and sound
            recordings.  Collections strengths include agriculture,  dry
            lands, oceanography, entomology, performing arts (especially
            film and television), photography,  Californiana,  materials
            on Mexico and Central America, 17th and 18th century British
            literature, health sciences, science fiction, and many  oth-
            ers.

            The periodical file, containing  more  than  640,000  unique
            titles  of newspapers, journals, proceedings, etc., includes
            the holdings  of  Stanford  University,  the  University  of
            Southern  California,  the  nineteen-campus California State
            University system, and selected other libraries.

            The MELVYL catalog also includes two article abstracting and
            indexing  files-MEDLINE  and Current Contents.  Use of these
            files, unlike the books and periodicals files, is restricted
            to  the  UC community.  The MELVYL MEDLINE database contains
            the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE  database,  which

            RLIN is the information management and retrieval  system  of
            The  Research  Libraries  Group, Inc.  It includes an online
            bibliographic database cataloging the holdings of well  over
            one   hundred  research  libraries,  archives,  and  special
            collections-a total of over forty million records in  August
            1990.   Entries are divided among eight files:  books, seri-
            als, archival materials (e.g., personal papers, governmental
            records),  maps,  music  scores,  sound  recordings,  visual
            materials (e.g., films and photographs), and computer files.
            Smaller  subject-oriented  databases  contain  citations for
            articles in art and architectural  periodicals;  eighteenth-
            century  English-language  publications;  art sales catalogs
            dating from the 1500s to the present; and  research  in  the
            humanities  scheduled  for  publication  within the next two
            years.

            Users search RLIN with  command-line  searches  rather  than
            from  a  menu, by specifying index terms.  Indexes available
            include title, subject, author, conference  or  corporation,
            ISBN,  LC  number,  and  many more; some are specific to the
            file being searched (such as the index to music  publishers'
            unique  numbers  on  sound  recordings  and scores).  Search
            results can be further restricted by language, date of  pub-
            lication, publisher, terms found in notes fields, etc.

            to  other online databases.  Some directors of libraries are
            sensitive to the  added  burden  this  may  place  on  their
            resources, so users are cautioned to use discretion.

            and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  NLS  supports  a
            separate online catalog for each campus.

            The UW-Madison online catalog contains more than 1.7 million
            titles cataloged since 1976 located in twenty-five libraries
            on the campus and at the Center for  Research  Libraries  in
            Chicago.   This  represents  roughly  fifty percent of their
            collections.  The  UW-Milwaukee  catalog  contains  approxi-
            mately  nine  hundred thousand titles and represents eighty-
            five percent of the general collection.

            Note on keyboard mappings:

            Because keyboard mappings are defined by the tn3270 software
            on  the  client's host computer, we are not able to tell you
            definitively how your keyboard will be mapped.  The  follow-
            ing  chart  shows a selection of the tn3270 keyboard mapping
            used on many UW Madison VAX  computers.   These  definitions
            are also used when accessing NLS via telnet as they are pro-
            vided by the 3270 software on the gateway machine.

            LUIS, the Library User Information Service, can be  used  to
            find  bibliographic information, locations, and call numbers
            for materials held by the libraries  of  the  University  of
            Illinois  at Chicago (UIC).  LUIS includes more than 860,000
            titles.  Older  items  in  the  UIC  libraries  may  not  be
            included in LUIS.

            LUIS contains records for all books cataloged since 1976 for
            the Library of the Health Sciences (LHS), and since 1977 for
            the other UIC libraries.   Many  older  books  in  the  east
            campus  libraries  are  also  included: all English-language
            books published since 1968, and virtually all books  in  the
            Architecture  and  Art,  Math,  and Science Libraries are in
            LUIS.

            LUIS also contains LHS audiovisuals cataloged since 1978 and
            selected  government documents at LHS.  Records and holdings
            for all periodicals currently received by LHS, and for  most
            periodicals  currently  received by the other libraries, are
            in LUIS.  Most titles not yet cataloged (including those  on
            order) are also included.

            emulation  problems, try typing  terminal VT100 at the ">>>"
            prompt.

            Now begin searching the LIAS database.  LIAS does  not  dif-
            ferentiate  between  author, title, and subjects in its com-
            mand structure.  Simply enter the words you wish to search.

            To see a list of databases that are available, type "SELECT"
            and press return.

            The user can type "HELP LIAS" for information.  For  a  list
            of  LIAS commands, type "HELP COMMANDS."  The extensive help
            command structure can answer most questions about  the  sys-
            tem.

            To exit the system and close your connection, type "END"  or
            "EXIT."

            The Harvard Online Library Information System (HOLLIS)  pro-
            vides  access to a number of databases including two library
            catalogs.  The  union  catalog  of  the  Harvard  University
            libraries  contains  approximately three million records for
            books,  journals,  manuscripts,  scores,  sound  recordings,
            visual  materials,  and computer files in the collections of
            most of the Harvard libraries.  (This database includes most
            items  cataloged since 1977, and is adding records for older
            materials at the rate of approximately one million per  year
            through a major retrospective conversion project.) The cata-
            log of older Widener Library materials contains about a mil-
            lion short records for books cataloged for the main research
            library before 1977.

            BUBL is the BUlletin Board for Libraries on JANET, the Joint
            Academic  NETwork  in  the U.K. BUBL collects information of
            interest to network- using librarians  and  their  users.  A
            major  aim is to provide librarians with information on ser-
            vices and resources on JANET and other networks  (e.g.,  the
            European  IXI network and the world-wide Internet). However,
            BUBL also covers items of general  interest  to  librarians.
            Moreover,  it  is increasingly used by non-librarians - lec-
            turers, students, and others - for the guidance it  provides
            on  finding and using networked resources and services. Most
            BUBL users are from the U.K. However, there are known  users
            in  several  other  countries, including Sweden, the Nether-
            lands, Canada, Hong Kong, and the U.S.A.

            BUBL is run by the Universities of Strathclyde  and  Glasgow
            on behalf of JUGL, the JANET User Group for Libraries. It is
            partially supported by the Information Systems Committee  of
            the Universities Funding Council and by private sponsorship,
            but is run on a mainly voluntary basis by the two  universi-
            ties.  The  user interface is provided by a software package
            called 'USERBUL'(copyright Leicester University  and  NISS).
            This  allows  information to be accessed through a series of
            menus  and  sub-menus.   However,  since  the   hierarchical

            The British Library Research and  Development  Division  has
            recently  funded  a six-month study into the future of BUBL.
            The study aims to investigate how BUBL's  role  and,  conse-
            quently,  its coverage and facilities should be developed in
            the next few years, and to produce a coherent,  co-ordinated
            and  costed short to medium term development plan as a guide
            to future efforts.

            The  Texas  Woman's  University  Library  has  revived   its
            newsletter  DATA ENTRIES and is making it available in elec-
            tronic form through free subscription over the Internet.

            DATA ENTRIES will cover events at the Mary Evelyn Blagg-Huey
            Library  in Denton, Texas, as well as developments in public
            services and the Woman's Collection.

            Perhaps it's not surprising that Texas Woman's University in
            Denton,  Texas,  has  a "woman's" collection in the library,
            but the fact that this collection is among the finest in the
            nation.  Begun in 1932, the Woman's Collection contains more
            than 42,000 books and periodicals, 2500 feet  of  manuscript
            and archival records, and approximately 20,000 photographs.

            Historical manuscripts include the personal papers  of  Her-
            mine Tobolowsky, the "Mother of the Texas Equal Legal Rights
            Amendment," Sarah Weddington  (Roe  v.  Wade),  and  authors
            Claire  Myers  Owens,  LaVerne Harrel Clark, and Edith Deen.
            In addition, the library has collected the records of signi-
            ficant women's organizations such as the Texas Federation of
            Women's Clubs, The Texas Federation of Business and  Profes-
            sional  Women,  the American Association of University Women
            (Texas), and the Texas state archives of Delta Kappa  Gamma.
            In  addition,  to  add to its growing collection on women in
            the military, TWU acquired the records of  the  WASP,  Inc.,
            the  veterans  organization for the Women's Airforce Service
            Pilots who flew during World War II.

            The Internet is home to a wide variety of data archives.  In
            this  section we try to list the more important and the more
            uncommon archives.  In particular, we do not  list  archives
            of  mailing lists, other than those that do software distri-
            butions.  Such archives can be located by asking  the  main-
            tainers of the mail lists.

            The Gene-Server is a mail response facility that will return
            a specific GenBank (tm) entry requested via e-mail.

            Other Services:

            The server  now  distributes  Protein  Information  Resource
            (PIR, also known as NBRF) protein sequence database entries.
            The  VMS  and  ASCII  versions  of  PIR  are  available  for
            anonymous FTP as well as via Gopher.

            Molecular biology software for Apple  Macintosh,  DOS,  Unix
            and VAX-VMS computers is also available from the server.

            A number of information files (the  R.  Roberts  Restriction
            Enzyme  database; sequence analysis reference, and such) are
            distributed.

            The Matrix of Biological Knowledge Archive-Server files  are
            now available only from this address.

            _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _A_c_c_e_s_s

            The server can be accessed via e-mail on the Internet,  BIT-
            NET, and UUCP networks.  The addresses to use are:

            Please be aware that a mail response program is not  "smart"
            and  can only respond to a limited set of commands.  GenBank
            entries are available by name and accession number only.

            Your request can consist of one of the following:

               HELP
               SEND HELP
               SEND GB-LOCUS genbanklocusname
               SEND INDEX indexname
               SEND ACCESSION accession_number
               SEND ACCESSION accessionumber(s)
               SEND KEYWORD genbankkeyword
               SEND PIR-KEYWORD pirkeyword
               SEND PIR-ACCESSION piraccessionnumber(s)

            There are many other parameters for specific subsets of  the
            Gene-Server, please see the individual HELP files.

            "HELP" will result in a small help  file  being  sent  back;
            everyone  should  request  the  help message.  The file will
            contain up-to-date information  about  the  server,  access,
            release  numbers,  and  policies.   The  help  message  also
            includes all index names, so "SEND INDEX" no  longer  works.
            "SEND  INDEX  index_name"  (where "index_name" is one of the
            index files listed in the HELP message)  will  work.   "SEND
            LOCUS   genbank_locus_name"   will  return  via  e-mail  the
            requested locus if it exists, and an  error  message  if  it
            does  not.   Use  the index file in the HELP message to find
            the name of the entry, or use the accession number.

            Note that large GenBank entries (Lambda,  EBV,  tobacco  and
            liverwort  chloroplasts)  may not make it through the thread
            of mailers.  UUCP mailers, in particular, silently enforce a
            limit  of  64,000 characters in a single mail message.  Note
            also that Usenet mail is very unreliable;  you  should  con-
            sult  the "pathalias" database to construct a mail path from
            your machine to bchs.uh.edu.  A local Unix mail  wizard  may
            be able to help.

            The Gene-Server itself silently  enforces  a  limit  of  one
            megabyte on a reply. Please do not ask for a lot of software
            or data in a single message.

            IMPORTANT NOTE: "gene-server@bchs.uh.edu" is an  MX  record.
            If  you  have problems reaching that address, ask your local
            system mail expert how to  handle  addresses  that  are  "MX
            records."  As a "very" last resort, send email to one of the
            addresses given above.

            The current version of GenBank on the server is Release  64.
            The  server  is  updated  as often as possible given funding
            (none) and  disk  space  constraints.   The  server  may  be
            updated daily in the future.

            Information and software is  exchanged  regularly  with  the
            European  Molecular  Biology  Laboratory (EMBL) File Server,
            and   the   molbio   ftp   sites,   "ftp.bchs.uh.edu"    and
            "nic.funet.fi"; but the specific files, syntax, and informa-
            tion vary between the four servers.

            The server contains a simple response to someone asking  for
            too  many  loci  or  otherwise abusing the service: it stops
            working for them.

            Questions  can  be  sent  to  davison@uh.edu  (Internet)  or
            DAVISON@UHOU(BITNET).   Requests  to  talk to a human rather
            than a mail response program  should  be  sent  to  archive-
            management@bchs.uh.edu.    By   popular   demand,   archive-
            managment@bchs.uh.edu also works.

            This service is provided  by  the  Institute  for  Molecular
            Biology,  the Department of Biochemical and Biophysical Sci-
            ences, and is funded by  the National Science Foundation.

            The server is not funded or related in any  with  the  DHHS,
            PHS,  National  Institutes  of Health, or its contractors or
            subcontractors on the GenBank contract.  GenBank is a trade-
            mark  of  the US Department of Health and Human Services, US
            Public Health Service.

            The LiMB (LIsting of Molecular Biology  databases)  database
            is  a  computer-based collection of information on molecular
            biology and related databases.  LiMB is intended to  facili-
            tate  locating  and  accessing these databases as well as to
            provide an ``overview'' that will help in developing a  sys-
            tematic,  coordinated  approach to designing, developing and
            maintaining these databases.

            Each entry in LiMB currently consists of 57 fields,  includ-
            ing:   database  staff names and addresses; database mainte-
            nance hardware and software; scope of coverage and  database
            goals; details about submission and access to the data sets;
            database size; and types of data covered  by  the  database.
            LiMB  entries  are based on questionnaires filled out by the
            database managers or, in the absence of  a  completed  ques-
            tionnaire,  on  secondary sources (e.g., a journal article).
            LiMB is currently maintained in a relational DBMS.

            LiMB is not available through direct network access.  It can
            be sent via electronic mail.

            The Medieval and Early Modern Data Bank is a  resource  pro-
            ject  established  at Rutgers University and co-sponsored by
            The Resource Libraries Group, Inc.  Its aim  is  to  provide
            scholars  with  a continually expanding reference library of
            information  concerning  the  medieval  and   early   modern
            periods,   circa   A.D.    800-1800.   Because  MEMDB  is  a
            computer-based, electronic reference tool, it offers remark-
            able  facilities  for  immediate  information  retrieval and
            manipulation.

            In 1993 MEMDB will become available in CD-ROM, available  at
            a  modest charge and with regular updates through Rutgers or
            RLG.  Its master data set will be vastly expanded.   MEMDB's
            scope  will extend to virtually any scholarly compilation of
            data that can be presented in a tabular form.  New  material
            to be incorporated will include information on such subjects
            as wages and prices, household  size,  mortality,  property-
            holdings,  charity,  and  nutrition, drawn from such sources
            as:

               o+  taxation records

               o+  wills and inventories

            SIMBAD is a complete database  for  observational  data  and
            bibliographic references accessible by the name or number of
            the astronomical object. It is nearly complete to  1950  for
            stars and to 1983 for non-stellar objects. It excludes solar
            system objects.  It  contains  information  from  all  major
            astronomical  journals  and  catalogs  and is also useful in
            providing a complete cross-reference of identifications  for
            an  object or for searches of known objects around a coordi-
            nate position.  SAO is the official NASA agent in  the  U.S.
            for  this  resource. The database is maintained in France by
            the Centre de Donnees astronomique de Strasbourg (CDS).  SAO
            provides administrative, network, and user assistance in the

            The files  in  the  above  collections  are  accessible  via
            ANONYMOUS  FTP.  The ANONYMOUS login directory holds several
            files containing detailed information on the collections  in
            general as well as files specific to certain collections.

            The MSDOS, MISC, and  CP/M  collections  are  maintained  by
            Keith  Petersen (W8SDZ), who makes periodic announcements of
            new releases to the INFO-IBMPC and INFO-CPM mailing lists.

            The UNIX-C and LINUX-OS collections are maintained  by  John
            Pliler   (JPLILER),   with  periodic  announcements  of  new
            releases made to the UNIX-SW mailing list.

            The MACINTOSH Collection is maintained by Bob Thum  (RTHUM),
            Stan  Sobczynski  (STAN),  and  John Mitchener (JMITCHENER),
            based on announcements  made  on  several  Macintosh-related
            mailing lists.

            The CPMUG, SIGM, ZSYS, HZ100, Ada, STARS, and  VHDL  collec-
            tions  are no longer actively maintained and are offered as-
            is.

            Each  mailing  list  mentioned  above  have   administrative
            addresses     of     the     form     listname-REQUEST@WSMR-
            SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL to take requests for  additions,  changes,

            returned  by the Dynamics Explorer satellites 1 & 2. It pro-
            vides interactive tools for displaying this data in  various
            ways and selected subsets may be acquired via anonymous FTP.
            This data is primarily used by those doing research in space
            physics,  magnetospheric  physics,  and  the dynamics of the
            upper atmosphere. The measurements are  classified  as  fol-

            This data base is accessible to other  universities  through
            BITNET  and  the Internet.  A LISTSERV virtual machine named
            SUPERSFT has been established at UIC for easy  retrieval  of
            the information.

            Access to the database is open to anyone with  a  BITNET  or
            Internet  connection.   Access  to the programs described in
            the database is controlled by their owners.

            Three files available through this LISTSERV provide informa-
            tion  about  the data base, an index to the data base, and a
            form for submission of information.  To receive these files,
            issue the following commands from a VM system on BITNET:

                    tell listserv at uicvm get supersft help  [for the help file]
                    tell listserv at uicvm get supersft index [for the index]
                    tell listserv at uicvm get supersft form  [for the submission form]

            If you do  not  use  a  VM  system,  send  a  standard  note
            addressed  to  ``listserv  at uicvm'' if you're on BITNET or
            ``listserv@uicvm.cc.uic.edu'' if  you're  on  the  Internet.
            The  note  should contain just the appropriate LISTSERV com-
            mands, such as

                    get [filename1 filetype1]
                    get [filename2 filetype2]

            substituting the names of the files of interest.

            Submissions to the data base can be made  either  electroni-
            cally or by mail.  The information submission form is in the
            file named SUPERSFT FORM mentioned above.

            SERVICE is an automatic mail program provided  by  the  NIC.
            It  allows  access  to  NIC online files and information via
            ordinary electronic mail.  This  is  especially  useful  for
            people who do not have access to the NIC via a direct Inter-
            net link.  Users can request publicly accessible  files  and
            searches in the WHOIS database via this server.  Replies are
            batched and sent back overnight.

            SERVICE looks only at the subject line of a message.   These
            are the services currently available:


            HELP          A help message with a list of current services.
            HOST xxx      Returns information about host xxx.  WHOIS xxx
                          can also be used  to  get  more  details  about
                          a host.
            IEN nnn       nnn is the  IEN  number  or  the  word INDEX.
            NETINFO xxx   xxx  is  a  file  name  or  the  word INDEX.
            RFC nnn       nnn is the  RFC  number  or  the  word INDEX.

            NICOLAS (Network Information Center On Line Aid System) is a
            menu-driven network user help system  that functions both as
            an information server  and an inter-network gateway.   As an
            information  server,  NICOLAS provides  syntaxes for  inter-
            network mail addressing, general information about wide-area
            networks, networking-related  "how to" files, information on
            current NASA missions & projects,  and a variety of network-
            and computer-related information of specific interest to the
            NASA-Goddard community.  As an automated inter-network gate-
            way, NICOLAS  enables users  to log into  their NASAMail and
            GSFCMail accounts, connect directly to a number of other on-
            line  resources,  and  perform  a variety  of "yellow pages"
            functions.

            The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database  (NED)  is  an  ongoing
            project to organize a broad range of published extragalactic
            data into a computer-based central archive designed for fast
            and flexible query via electronic networks.

            The June 1992 version of NED provides positions, names,  and
            basic  data  for more than 200,000 extragalactic objects, as
            well as related  bibliographic  references  and  notes  from
            catalogs  and  other  publications. It forwards to the user,
            upon request, files containing the data retrieved  during  a
            session.   It also allows users to view the contents of some
            major catalogs and to browse the abstracts of  recent  arti-
            cles  of  extragalactic interest from several major journals
            (including A&A, AJ, ApJ, IAU Circulars, MNRAS,  PASP,  their
            Letters  and  Supplements).  The current release also intro-
            duces the capability of searches filtered  by  object  types
            (e.g.  find galaxies only, or exclude infrared sources), and
            provides the first phase of detailed  data  collection  from
            catalogs and the literature.

            NED is an object-oriented database, meaning that all  infor-
            mation  is  organized  around  a master list of astronomical
            objects (such as galaxies, groups of galaxies,  quasars  and
            radio  sources) obtained from detailed cross-identifications
            among some thirty major catalogs.  Additional  catalogs  are
            being  folded  in  continually.   Objects can be selected by

            Unidata is a national program to help  universities  acquire
            weather  data  and  to  analyze  and  display those data for
            teaching and research. The program is funded by the National
            Science Foundation and managed by the University Corporation
            for Atmospheric Research. Unidata negotiates  a  group  con-
            tract  with  a  commercial  data-broadcasting  firm  so that
            universities may receive weather data at a  discount.   Uni-
            data   develops  and  distributes  software  for  capturing,
            analyzing, and displaying those data locally.  Unidata  also
            advocates  on  behalf  of  universities  on  data  issues in
            Federal and other arenas.

            Unidata-developed software includes the Unidata  Local  Data
            Manager  (LDM), which captures real-time weather data from a
            satellite  broadcast,  and  netCDF,  a  network-transparent,
            self-describing  form  for storing scientific data.  The LDM
            is being enhanced to allow users to capture and forward data
            over the Internet.

            Unidata  distributes  applications  software  developed  and
            licensed  by  universities.  These  are  Purdue University's
            Weather Processor (WXP) and the  University  of  Wisconsin's
            McIDAS-OS2  and  McIDAS-X  software.  WXP  and  McIDAS-X are
            UNIX-based applications; McIDAS-OS2 runs on  PS/2  computers
            with the OS/2 operating system. Unidata also distributes and
            supports the UNIX version  of  NASA's  GEMPAK  (for  General

            Unidata provides bug fixes, upgrades, and software distribu-
            tions  over  the Internet. Software support includes forming
            and maintaining  special-interest  mailing  lists,  offering
            advice  on  hardware  acquisitions,  and  holding semiannual
            training workshops in the use of Unidata-supported software.
            Consultation  with users is conducted via email. The program
            also publishes a quarterly newsletter.

            Archie is a central database for information  about  archive
            sites.  It  speeds the task of finding a specific program on
            the net.  Archie keeps track of UNIX sites; VMS sites may be
            added in the near future.

            Archie is a pair of software tools: the  first  maintains  a
            list  of several hundred Internet ftp archive sites, each of
            which is updated about once a month.  The second tool allows
            outsiders  to  log  onto  the  host  to  query the database.
            Archie also maintains a Software Description Database of the
            names  and  descriptions of various software packages, docu-
            ments, and datasets that are kept on anonymous  ftp  archive
            sites  around  the Internet. The "whatis" command allows you
            to search this database.

            "help" command gives you information about  various  topics,
            including  the  commands available and how to use them.  The
            "raw" listings of ftp sites are stored in compressed form in
            the   directory  "ftp/archie/listings".   Manual  pages  for
            archie are available in the directory "ftp/archie/doc".  The
            file "archie.man.roff" contains a UNIX-style manual entry in
            *roff format; "archie.man.txt" contains the same information
            preformatted for people on non-UNIX systems.

            Users can ask archie to search for  specific  name  strings.

            string, the size of the program, its last modification date,
            where it can be found on the host,  and  some  other  useful
            information.  This example would find archive sites that are
            storing Kyoto Common Lisp.  Complete anonymous ftp  listings
            of sites in the database can be obtained via the "site" com-
            mand; for a list of sites, see the "list" command.

            There is an electronic mail interface to archie.  To receive
            the  latest  information  on  this  interface,  send mail to
            "archie@cs.mcgill.ca" with the word "help"  in  the  subject
            line or body.

            If you can't access the manual files via interactive ftp  or
            the   mail-based   servers,   send  a  message  to  "archie-
            admin@cs.mcgill.ca" asking to receive a copy of  the  manual
            by mail.

            Send   comments,   bug   reports,   etc.    to:     "archie-
            l@cs.mcgill.ca".  If  you know of an anonymous ftp site that
            archie doesn't seem to maintain, or if you have additions or
            corrections  to the Software Description Database, send mail
            to: "archie-admin@cs.mcgill.ca".

            "Satellite" archie servers are being set up in  Finland  and
            the  Netherlands  in  order  to lessen the load on the tran-
            satlantic Internet link.

            The maintainers of archie strongly encourage maintainers  of
            anonymous ftp archives to do two things:


            o+    Send additions and corrections to the Software  Distri-
                 bution Database to "archie-admin@cs.mcgill.ca".


            o+    Maintain  compressed,  automated,  recursive   listings
                 (ls-1R.Z  files)  on their machines.  This lessens net-
                 work loads and makes  life  easier  for  archie.   Send
                 queries    for    specific    formats    to    "archie-
                 admin@cs.mcgill.ca".

            American & Caribbean Political Affairs.  Updated four days a
            week,  the  database  contains some of the most current news
            and analysis available on the region.  Much of the  informa-
            tion  is  assembled from unfiltered news sources originating
            from Latin America, providing an ability  for  organizations
            to  understand  and  monitor  the environments in which they
            have business and research interests.  Currently, the  data-
            base  contains  more than twenty thousand articles-from 1987
            to present-with approximately six  hundred  new  ones  added
            each month.

            The International Centre for Distance Learning (ICDL)  is  a
            documentation centre based on the campus of the Open Univer-
            sity in the United Kingdom, specializing in  collecting  and
            disseminating  information  on distance education worldwide.
            With a grant from the British Government's Overseas Develop-
            ment  Administration, ICDL has now developed a comprehensive
            computerized database on distance  education  for  the  Com-
            monwealth of Learning.

            The database contains information on :


               o+  Distance-taught programmes and courses  in  the   Com-
                  monwealth (22,000+)

               o+  Distance teaching institutions worldwide (600+)

               o+  Literature  of  distance  education  worldwide  (4500+
                  entries)

            Some of the literature entries contain full text  of  papers
            as well as bibliographic details and abstracts.

            lishes  a  quarterly  hard copy accessions list, which gives
            details of literature  in  distance  education  received  in
            ICDL.  This list is available by writing to ICDL. ICDL would
            like to hear about  new  literature  and  from  institutions
            involved in distance teaching. General enquiries may be sent
            to the email address quoted above.

            The LIDO MAILSERVER for AI literature at the  University  of
            Saarbruecken,  Germany  allows  for the retrieval of biblio-
            graphic information on  AI-related  publications  via  elec-
            tronic  mail.  The references are returned in LaTeX (Bibtex)
            format or in a refer-like format.  As  of  1991,  more  than
            twenty  thousand  documents  are  contained in its database,
            with an annual increase of twenty-five percent.  About  four
            thousand  bibliographic  requests are currently handled each
            year.

            Queries to the  bibliographic  database  may  refer  to  the
            author  name(s),  the  title,  and  the year of publication.
            Substring search and regular expressions (egrep) are  possi-
            ble.   Global  keywords or classification hierarchies cannot
            be accessed.  Users who already have a certain overview of a
            field  will  thus  probably  profit more from the LIDO MAIL-
            SERVER than novices  familiarizing  themselves  with  a  new
            area.

            For more information on this service, send the following  e-
            mail message:

            The EMBL Data Library offers a range of electronic  services
            to the molecular biology research community.

            An electronic mail server and an anonymous ftp server  allow
            access  to  a  large  number  of important data collections,
            including the EMBL nucleotide sequence database, the  SWISS-
            PROT  protein  sequence database, and the Brookhaven protein
            structure database. In addition  to  the  complete  quartely
            releases  of  the  sequence  databases weekly updates of the
            EMBL database are provided for downloading by  ftp.  Indivi-
            dual EMBL database entries can be retrieved using the e-mail
            server, and new entries are made available on a daily basis.

            The Data Library also maintains an archive of free  software
            for  molecular biology. More than 200 different programs are
            currently available for MS-DOS, Vax/VMS, UNIX and  Macintosh
            systems and can be downloaded by e-mail or anonymous ftp.

            New data collections and software are added constantly.

            The FASTA and QuickSearch services enable  remote  users  to
            perform  sequence  similarity  searches against a variety of
            nucleotide and  protein  sequence  databases  maintained  at
            EMBL. Whereas QuickSearch is appropriate for the quick iden-
            tification of very similar database entries, FASTA is better

            suited  for  the  detection  of   more   distantly   related
            sequences.  The  database available for searches are updated
            daily,  thus  access  to  latest  sequence  information   is
            guaranteed.

            A Gopher server (EMBnet BioInformation Resource EMBL) is  in
            operation  which  sits  on  top  of  the  EMBL anonymous ftp
            archive. It is part of the EMBnet BioGopher network.

            Anyone with direct or gatewayed access to the  Internet  can
            use the EMBL servers.

            The addresses to use are:

               NetServ@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE
                  (E-mail file server)

               Fasta@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE

               Quick@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE
                  (QuickSearch database similarity searches)

            Detailed descriptions of access procedures and the  informa-
            tion  available  can be obtained by sending the word HELP on
            the Subject line or in the body of an e-mail message to  the
            addresses shown above.

            The anonymous ftp server can be reached at:

               ftp.EMBL-heidelberg.DE

            Use the user name "anonymous" and  your  e-mail  address  as
            password  to  log in.  Some older ftp clients might get con-
            fused by multiple message lines. In this case, enter a  dash
            "-"  as  the  first  character  of the password to turn this
            feature off.

            The Gopher server can be accessed at  ftp.EMBL-Heidelberg.DE
            at port 70.

            also be used to contact the Data Library staff.

            The   EMBL   anonymous   ftp   server   is    mirrored    by
            ftp.weizmann.ac.il.

            The software provided is exchanged with the file servers  at
            the  University  of  Indiana  (Iubio)  and the University of
            Houston (Gene-Server).

            These network services are provided  in  collaboration  with

            The Energy and Climate Information Exchange (ECIX) is a pro-
            ject  of EcoNet aimed at educating the environmental commun-
            ity and the general public on the potential of energy  effi-
            ciency  and  renewable energy to to reduce the use of fossil
            fuels and their contribution to global climate change.   The
            ECIX  File Distribution Service provides a wide selection of
            information, policy statements, newsletters, and other files
            pertaining  to  energy and climate issues.  Contributions of
            pertinent  materials  are  encouraged.   File  listings  are
            updated regularly and the revised file lists are distributed
            via  email  to  subscribers  and  several   environmentally-
            oriented newsgroups and lists.

            The ECIX Project is funded by a grant from the Joyce  Mertz-
            Gilmore Foundation.

            The Internet supports several databases that  contain  basic
            information about users, such as e-mail addresses, telephone
            numbers, and  postal  addresses.   These  databases  can  be
            searched  to  get  information about particular individuals.
            Because they serve a function akin to  the  telephone  book,
            these databases are often referred to as "white pages."

            The Knowbot Information Service is  a  white  pages  ``meta-
            service'' that provides a uniform interface to heterogeneous
            white pages services in the  Internet.   Using  the  Knowbot
            Information  Service,  one  can form a single query that can
            search for white pages information from the NIC  WHOIS  ser-
            vice,  the  RIPE  European white pages service and MCI Mail,
            among others, and have the responses displayed in a  single,
            uniform format.

            Inclusion of additional information  about  an  organization
            with  which  a  person is affiliated enables access to addi-
            tional white pages services  including  the  NYSERNet  X.500
            White  Pages  Pilot  project,  and over 200 finger and whois
            services run by individual organizations.   For  example,  a
            query  about  <droms@bucknell>  will return results from the
            NYSERNet White Pages project and from the finger  server  on
            <sol.cs.bucknell.edu>.

            CICNet, Inc. is a regional midlevel network serving a  seven
            state  region  of the midwestern United States, and includes
            the members of the Big Ten plus the University of Chicago as
            its  Charter  Members.   CICNet  provides  DS-1 (1.544 mbps)
            backbone connections between its eleven  nodes,  and  incor-
            porates  cisco  Systems  routers and Datatel CSUs.  Interex-
            change network services are currently provided by MCI.   The
            Mission Statement of CICNet is to provide its member organi-
            zations with the ability to share advanced information  sys-
            tems  -  high  speed  data networking, computing, video, and
            telecommunications - for the purpose of  enhancing  academic
            advancement  and  scientific  research  within a seven state
            region of the midwestern United States.

            CICNet is managed by an Executive Director and  a  Board  of
            Directors.  Technical support services - Network Information
            Center and Network Operations Center -  are  provided  under
            contract  with  MERIT.  Funding for the first year of CICNet
            has been provided by  the  eleven  member  institutions  and
            grant funding from the National Science Foundation.

            CICNet is in the process of finalizing  its  Business  Plan.
            The  current version calls for the organization to have five
            categories of membership: Charter,  Institutional/Nonprofit,
            State/Subregional    Networks,   Research   Corporate,   and

            JvNCnet is a  North  East  Research  Regional  Network  with
            direct  access  to  the  NSFNET  backbone.  JvNCnet also has
            international connections to several Scandinavian  countries
            (Norway,  Finland,  Iceland,  Sweden,  and  Denmark) via the
            network's connection to NORDUnet, and to France and Switzer-
            land via the link to INRIA.

            The regional network, the first T-1  (1.544  Mbps)  academic
            network, evolved from the thirteen members of the Consortium
            for Scientific Computing to a  regional  network,  currently
            with  thirty-one  sites concentrated in the Northeast.  When
            the John von Neumann National Supercomputer Center closed in
            April  1990,  JvNCnet  moved its headquarters to, and became
            part of, Princeton University.

            JvNCnet is engineered as a backbone network  where  backbone
            nodes  are  connected  to each other with multiple T1 lines.
            These backbone nodes fan out to connect JvNCnet  members  at
            T1,  fractional  T1  (128 kbps), 56 kbps, 19.2 kbps, and 9.6
            kbps over dedicated and dial-up lines.  Backbone  nodes  are
            located at phone company premises in the cities of Princeton
            (NJ), Trenton (NJ), Philadelphia (PA), Boston  (MA),  Provi-
            dence  (RI), New Haven (CT), New York (NY), and Newark (NJ).
            Member institutions connect to the  closest  backbone  node,

            Los Nettos is a regional network in the Los Angeles area.

            Important features of Los Nettos are that it is  (1)  an  IP
            network,  and  (2) it is ``high speed.'' All connections and
            links are at least T1 (1.5 Mbps) capacity.  A  goal  of  Los
            Nettos is to provide an environment to develop very interac-
            tive network applications.

            Los Nettos is operated by the member organizations,  not  by
            DARPA,  or  NASA,  NSF, or DOE, etc.  It may be used for any
            educational or research purpose.

            The  member  organizations  are  universities  and  research
            laboratories.   The  Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of
            the University of Southern  California  (USC)  acts  as  the
            agent for Los Nettos.

            Nine organizations are already participating in this network
            (ISI, USC, JPL, CalTech, UCLA, TIS, Rand, TRW, and NOSC).  A
            number of  other  research  centers  have  expressed  strong
            interest in participating.

            Los Nettos will interoperate with CERFnet and other networks
            to provide access to special resources (for example, the San

            NSFNET for  organizations  in  the  Minnesota  area.  It  is
            presently established as a nonprofit corporation with active
            participation by member organizations.  Its  mission  is  to
            provide and facilitate the use of computer networks in order
            to enhance  the  high-technology  research  and  educational
            environment,  and  to increase the productivity and competi-
            tiveness of businesses throughout  the  state.  The  primary
            tasks  of MRNet are to promote, facilitate, and support con-
            nectivity; disseminate information  on  computer  networking
            and technologies; pursue connections to other networks; pro-
            vide a forum  for  the  investigation  of  computer  network
            issues;  and contribute to state, national and international
            planning in computer net- works.

            marily  located  in  Illinois,  Wisconsin, and Indiana.  The
            NCSAnet private corporate network is national in scale.

            NCSAnet is a dual-hub network with hubs on the  campuses  of
            the  University  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at Chi-
            cago.  The Chicago hub, or, CHUB, is a Chicago  area  metro-
            politan  network  with  current  members UI-Chicago, Univ of
            Chicago (see also CICnet), Northwestern (see  also  CICnet),
            Illinois  Inst.  of  Tech., Argonne National Laboratory, and
            Notre Dame.  The Urbana hub connects the Univ  of  Wisconsin

            NEARnet, the New England Academic and Research Network, is a
            regional  high  speed  data communications network.  NEARnet
            was founded in 1988 by Boston  University,  Harvard  Univer-
            sity,  and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to meet
            a growing need for fast, reliable information exchange.   It
            is  linked to other regional and national networks to create
            a national infrastructure for electronic information.

            NEARnet is a cooperative project  which  continues  to  grow
            very  rapidly.  As of October 1992, NEARnet has grown to 174
            member organizations.  These members include  New  England's
            finest  universities, colleges, technology-based industries,
            government and private agencies.   Since  its  inception  in
            1988,  NEARnet's  management  and  operations  has been con-
            tracted to Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.

            Utilizing the Internet TCP/IP protocol suite,  NEARnet  sup-
            ports  leased-line  and  microwave links at speeds from 19.2
            Kb/s to 10 Mb/s.  Dialup IP access is also  supported  using
            SLIP  starting  at  9.6 Kb/s.  In addition to technical sup-
            port, consulting, and user information services, the NEARnet
            staff maintains a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week network opera-
            tions center.

            Sesquinet is a regional network in Texas.  It was  organized
            in  1986  specifically  to  fill  the  regional network role
            within the NSFnet scheme.  It has been operational since May
            1987.

            Sesquinet is primarily an IP network, and connects  directly
            to the NSFnet backbone via an NSS at Rice University.

            In cooperation with THEnet we also carry intra-state  DECnet
            Phase IV that can be passed to SPAN/HEPnet.

            Our original and slowest lines are 56kb/s, and these  remain
            the  normative circuit technology for access from individual
            sites.  We are deploying T1 circuits in two ways:

            o+    In cooperation with THEnet, we are building  an  inter-
                 city  redundant  high-speed  backbone.  Initially, this
                 will be a T1 triangle connecting Houston (Rice  Univer-
                 sity),  Austin (the University of Texas at Austin), and
                 Dallas (the University of Texas at Dallas).

            o+    In addition, some individual  sites  are  connected  to
                 this  intercity  backbone  via T1 circuits.  The Baylor
                 College of Medicine is the first to do so.

            Throughout this network, cisco gateways are used.

            Current  members  include  universities  (e.g.,  Rice,   the
            University  of  Houston,  Texas  A&M  University,  and Texas

            Westnet is a regional network with nodes in  the  states  of
            Arizona,  Colorado,  southern  Idaho,  New  Mexico, Utah and
            Wyoming.

            Westnet is a Wide Area Network  operating  at  moderate  (56
            kbps)  and  high  (T-1,  i.e., 1.544 Mbps) data transmission
            capacities, providing connectivity from  end  nodes  to  the
            NSFNet  backbone.  Westnet has connections into the backbone
            at the National Center for Atmospheric  Research  (NCAR)  in
            Boulder,  Colorado,  and  at  the University of Utah in Salt
            Lake City, Utah.  The goal of  Westnet  is  to  provide  the
            regional  infrastructure  to  support research and scholarly
            activity.

            The member organizations are universities, research  labora-
            tories,  and  commercial organizations.  Westnet is governed

            the  seventeen  primary  university  nodes  in the six-state
            region.

            A variety of organizations  already  participating  in  this
            network include: in Colorado: Ford Aerospace, the US Depart-
            ment of Agriculture, and US West Communications;  in  Idaho:
            the  Idaho  National  Engineering Laboratory; in New Mexico:
            the Air Force Weapons Laboratory, the Apache  Peak  Observa-

            spot Observatory, Rockwell International, and the  Santa  Fe
            Institute; and in Utah: the UMC Research Station.

            Westnet interoperates with the state networking agencies of:
            AriZona  Telecommunications Educational Cooperative (AZTEC),
            Colorado SuperNet  (CSN),  and  New  Mexico  Technet  (NMT).
            State  networking  organizations  are  presently  being con-

            The NASA Science Network (NSN) is an IP network  which  sup-
            ports scientists and flight projects funded by NASA's Office
            of Space Science and Applications  (OSSA).  The  network  is
            used  to  provide  remote access to such resources as scien-
            tific databases and supercomputing centers.  The  NSN  main-
            tains  hubs at several NASA centers which are interconnected
            in a partial mesh topology. These backbone sites use terres-
            trial  circuits  ranging in speed from 168 to 672 Kbps. From
            these hubs radiate numerous tail circuits; the  majority  of
            these tails are 56 Kbps, with a few at 9.6 Kbps as well.

            The NSN was designed to provide NASA's  scientific  communi-
            ties with a more general networking approach that would pro-
            vide  full  networking  services  in  a   vendor-independent
            environment. These services include file transfer and remote
            logon as well as email.

            NSN is a NASA-wide  network  managed  by  the  NASA  Science
            Internet  Project Office (NSIPO) at Ames Research Center. It
            is used for NASA-funded space science research programs  and
            flight projects.

            Users  include  NASA  sites,  and   government   facilities,
            research,   and   academic   sites   conducting  NASA-funded
            research.

            PREPnet is a mid-level data network in the  Commonwealth  of
            Pennsylvania.  It was initiated through the joint efforts of
            the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania government, Bell  Telephone
            of  Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania consortium of univer-
            sities:  Carnegie  Mellon  University,  Drexel   University,
            Lehigh University, Penn State Universtiy, Temple University,
            the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pitts-
            burgh.   Chartered  in 1988, PREPnet's purpose is to facili-
            tate education, research, technology transfer, and  economic
            development within the state.

            The Commonwealth is  the  inter-LATA  carrier  and  Bell  of
            Pennsylvania  is  the  network  operator/  owner  of the hub
            equipment and  marketing  agent  for  network  access.   The
            Pittsburgh  Supercomputing  Center  provides  supercomputing
            resources and a gateway to the NSFNET.  Member  institutions
            have  made  a  variety of information resources available on
            PREPnet,  such  as  university  library  catalogs,  bulletin
            boards,  and various databases containing statistical, agri-
            cultural, demographic, economic, and medical data.

            SURAnet, the Southeastern Universities Research  Association
            Network, is a project of SURA, the Southeastern Universities
            Research Assocation. SURA is a  consortium  of  universities
            which  supports, manages, and operates projects too large or
            complex to be handled by a single university.

            SURAnet, a TCP/IP network, is one of  the  NSFNET  mid-level
            networks.  Connectivity  is  provided  via a T-1 backbone of
            co-located equipment  housed  in  MCI  points  of  presence.
            Future plans include migration to a T-3 backbone.

            SURAnet is connected to the  NSFNET  backbone  and  provides
            facilities for the FIX-East connections.

            SURAnet's geographic area includes the District of  Columbia
            and  13  states  in  the southeastern US: Alabama, Delaware,
            Florida, Georgia,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Maryland,  Missis-
            sippi,  North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia,
            and West Virginia.

            While SURA, the parent  organization,  is  a  consortium  of
            academic  organizations,  SURAnet  members comprise approxi-
            mately two-thirds academic institutions and  one-third  non-
            academic sites.

            NORDUnet is a collaboration between  the  national  research
            networks  in  Denmark,  Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.
            Its purpose is to provide the national research  and  educa-
            tion  communities with an efficient networking service which
            ensures coherence of the national R & D  networks  and  con-
            nects  these  to  similar networks in the rest of Europe and
            the world.

            NORDUnet is organized as a consortium agreement between  the
            national  networks  DENet,  FUNET, SUNET, SURIS and UNINETT.
            The administration is an integral part of UNI-C in Denmark.

            NORDUnet has contracted its  work  mainly  to  the  national
            organizations.   The network operations center has been con-
            tracted to KTH/SUNET. It is their responsibility to  monitor
            the  service,  configure  the  Cisco routers (IP) as well as
            coordinate operational issues.   The  X.25  operations  have
            been  contracted  to UNINETT and DECNET operations to UNI-C.
            Overall  technical  coordination  has  been  contracted   to
            VTKK/FUNET.

            NORDUnet has five points of presence, one  in  each  of  the
            Nordic countries.

            NORDUnet provides IP, DECNET, X.25 and  CLNS  layer  3  ser-
            vices, in this order of volume. NORDUnet leases bandwidth in
            form raw lines and adds value by providing the network layer
            protocols  in  a coordinated fashion with equipment operated
            through various contracts.  The national networks which  are
            the  NORDUnet  customers  see  it as a "NORDUnet plug" which
            provides different service "pins".

            NJE traffic is transported over TCP/IP. The CLNS  (including
            DECNET Phase V) pilot traffic is carried by the same Cisco's
            as the production traffic.   The  external  connections  are
            mainly  based  on  Cisco  routers. NORDUnet runs IP and CLNS
            protocols to the US and IP, CLNS and DECNET  IV  to  Europe.
            X.25 connectivity to Europe is provided via a direct connec-
            tion to the IXI network.

            There are app. 60.000 IP hosts, 5000 DECnet hosts,  and  100
            EARN  hosts  in the Nordic national networks that are inter-
            connected  by  NORDUnet.   NORDUnet  connects  the  national
            Nordic  networks  to  Internet, Ebone, EASInet, EARN/BITNET,
            EUnet, HEPnet, SPAN and IXI.

            The Terrestrial Wideband Network was built and  deployed  by
            BBN  STC  as  a  part  of  the  initial phase of the Defense
            Research Internet (DRI).  In May 1989, this network replaced
            the  Satellite Wideband Network, which had been in operation
            for the previous 8 years.   The  Satellite  Wideband  was  a
            domestic  3 Mbit/sec network that had been used for research
            into the use of packet satellite technology  to  efficiently
            support  applications  with  varying  delay, throughput, and
            reliability requirements, e.g., interconnection  of  distri-
            buted  operating  system clusters, development of end-to-end
            bulk transfer protocols, multimedia conferencing,  intercon-
            nection  real-time  interactive simulation/training systems.
            The Terrestrial Wideband continues this tradition  by  using
            one  of  the cross-country T1 trunks from the DARPA National
            Networking Testbed (NNT) to support research in  high  speed
            networking,  to  provide  connectivity  among  academic  and
            government sites, and to support a testbed for Internet pro-
            tocol  development  and  experimentation  with applications.
            Currently this network is  carrying  cross-country  Internet
            datagram  traffic associated with DARPA-funded projects.  It
            also supports a research  environment  for  multimedia  con-
            ferencing  and voice/video conferencing using gateways which
            use a real-time connection oriented protocol over a  connec-
            tionless network.

            Access to the Terrestrial Wideband is typically via an IP or
            ST  gateway.  Connection of such a host is at the discretion
            of DARPA.  The current network includes the following  Wide-
            band  Packet  Switches (WPS) and user sites -- BBN (BBN), NY
            (RADC), Washington (DARPA, NRL), Chicago (NCSA),  LA  (ISI),
            SRI  (SRI,  Stanford).   This fall, Ft Monmouth will be con-
            nected to the NY WPS and CMU will be connected to a  WPS  to
            be installed in Pittsburgh.

            The Terrestrial Wideband Network is to be  used  for  DARPA-
            funded  research  and development activities of the Internet
            community.  Users typically access the network via  gateways
            which have Internet connectivity to the Terrestrial Wideband
            Network.  Applications which might  benefit  most  from  the
            Terrestrial  Wideband  Network  are those which require high
            bandwidth and/or low delay  between  geographically  distant
            sites,  such  as bulk file transfer, remote procedure calls,
            conferencing, graphic simulations, and distributed operating
            systems.

            a) System and Network Architecture
                 The  Terrestrial  Wideband  is   currently   a   trans-
                 continental network built on T1 trunks belonging to the
                 National Networking Testbed (NNT).  The Wideband packet
                 switch  nodes  (WPSs)  are  located  at  unattended NNT
                 Points of Presence (POPs).  They are based on Butterfly
                 multiprocessor  hardware  and  are connected via the T1
                 fiberoptic trunks into a backbone  configuration.   The
                 WPSs  pass  network traffic using the Dual Bus Protocol
                 reservation scheme.  Local area networks at user sites,
                 e.g.,  ethernets,  are connected to the backbone packet
                 switches via Internet IP and ST gateways  and  T1  tail
                 circuits.

                 The current topology of  the  network,  which  resulted
                 from  external  constraints,  is  a  series  of  packet
                 switches connected in a line by T1  trunks.   This  can
                 result in partitioning of the network in the event of a
                 packet switch failure.  To minimize outages,  the  Ter-
                 restrial   Wideband   Network   includes  a  number  of
                 features.  The  multiprocessor  hardware  configuration
                 used  for the packet switch provides redundancy in case



            September 27, 1989          NNSC       Section 5.21,  Page 2








                 a processor node fails.  Also, a failsafe box  isolates
                 the WPS upon detection of an outage while continuing to
                 maintain connectivity between the T1 trunks in and  out
                 of the failed WPS, thus maintaining network continuity.
                 The network also allows remote  dial-in  access  for  a
                 number of emergency functions that would otherwise have
                 to be performed by on-site staff.

            b) Operations
                 A remote monitoring  center  provides  network  control
                 capabilities,  and  a dialup capability provides backup
                 monitoring and control when necessary.  The Terrestrial
                 Wideband  Network packet switch software can be updated
                 via remote downloading.  Network operations support  is
                 provided between 8AM and 8PM Eastern time.

            c) Protocols

                 - TCP/IP traffic is supported by the Terrestrial  Wide-
                 band  Network.   This is accomplished by using standard
                 Internet gateways.

                 - Stream Protocol (ST) protocol (based on IEN  119)  is
                 used   between   gateways   which  support  voice/video
                 traffic.  This is a connection-oriented protocol  which
                 operates  over  the connectionless Terrestrial Wideband
                 Network, and allows the gateways  to  send  packets  to
                 other  destinations  with minimal delay, as is required
                 for voice/video conferencing.

                 - Gateways communicate with  the  Terrestrial  Wideband
                 Network  packet  switches   (WPSs)  via the Host Access
                 Protocol (HAP), specified in RFC 907-A.  This is a pro-
                 tocol  by  which  a  host can send datagrams across the
                 network, and can request and manage network bandwidth.

                 -  The  WPS  software  provides  an  echo  host   which
                 responds  to  ICMP ping  packets.

                 - Dual Bus Protocol  provides  a  link-level  transport
                 protocol  which uses a reservation mechanism to provide
                 access fairness for each WPS.  This is a type  of  Dis-
                 tributed  Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) protocol similar to the
                 IEEE 802.6 Metropolitan Area  Network  (MAN)  protocol,
                 but with features that support wide area networking and
                 multimedia conferencing.  Whereas  conventional  packet
                 store  and forwarding would involve per packet forward-
                 ing processing  and  buffering  at  every  intermediate



            September 27, 1989          NNSC       Section 5.21,  Page 3








                 node, a DQDB protocol performs processing and buffering
                 only at the entry point and  minimizes  the  processing
                 and buffering at subsequent nodes along the trunk until
                 the exit point.

                 - Wideband Monitoring Protocol (IP protocol number  78)
                 is used between the WPSs and the monitoring center.

            The ICBNet establishes Internet links  between  the  ARPANET
            and  cooperating  groups  of  researchers within NATO sites,
            providing transit service and a testbed for  joint  NATO  C3
            and interoperability experiments.  These links have replaced
            the old SATNET (Atlantic Packet Satellite Network)  service.
            Point-to-point trans-Atlantic service between the US and the
            UK and between the US and Italy connects  the  ARPANET  with
            local  networks at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment
            (RSRE) and the University College London (UCL), both in  the
            UK,  and at the Italian National Research Council (CNUCE) in
            Italy.   The  Norwegian  Telecommunications   Administration
            Research  Establishment  (NTARE)  accesses  the  network via
            RSRE.  Connections to the SHAPE Technical  Centre  (STC)  in
            the  Netherlands and the Warrior Preparation Center (WPC) in
            West Germany will be added within the next few months.

            The US-to-Europe links are provided via full  duplex  64kbps
            connections  between  a  Butterfly Gateway located at BBN in
            Cambridge, and the Butterfly Gateway at  RSRE,  and  between
            the  Butterfly  Gateway  at DARPA in Arlington, Va., and the
            Butterfly Gateway at CNUCE.

            CONCERT is actually two networks; one  for  video,  one  for
            data.   Both  are  carried  over CONCERT's private microwave
            facilities that span 453 path miles from  Asheville  in  the
            west to Greenville in the east.

            CONCERT OBJECTIVES

               o+  Participate in the deployment of National Research and
                  Education Network (NREN) for North Carolina.

               o+  Develop high-performance  capabilities  in  visualiza-
                  tion, supercomputing, and distributed systems.


            VIDEO NETWORK

            CONCERT utilizes two duplex analog NTSC video channels  that
            function  as a multi-way, interactive videoconferencing net-
            work  to  encourage  research,  education,  and   technology
            transfer.   An  additional duplex video channel connects the
            state's four medical schools.  The interactive  video  chan-
            nels  provide face-to-face communications capabilities among
            all institutions.  Each institution has videoconference  and
            video teleclass facilities.

            Specific programs and applications include:

               o+  videoconferencing  capabilities  for  researchers  and
                  faculty;

               o+  graduate and extension courses in a variety of discip-
                  lines;

               o+  seminars in supercomputing and high-performance compu-
                  tation;

               o+  research collaborations among members of the  research
                  community;

               o+  scientific and technical seminars and workshops; and

               o+  medical courses and programs.

            Sixty percent of the available video network time is  booked
            for  courses  and  regularly  scheduled  seminars,  with the
            remaining time reserved for meetings and conferences.   This
            open  time  provides researchers and faculty the opportunity
            to meet as required with little prior notice.

            DATA NETWORK

            The CONCERT data network functions  as  a  mid-level  TCP/IP
            network  providing  access  to the INTERNET, a collection of
            data networks across the nation  and  world  interconnecting
            universities,  government  agencies,  national laboratories,



            September 1, 1992           NNSC       Section 5.23,  Page 2








            non-profit research organizations,  and  industry.   Through
            CONCERT,  North  Carolina researchers from academia, govern-
            ment, and industry have access to these resources as well as
            electronic  mail  and USENET news for communications, learn-
            ing, and collaboration with colleagues.

            The CONCERT network is built from an interconnected  collec-
            tion  of  IP routers spanning the state.  T3 links are util-
            ized for the Triangle campuses; T1 circuits for institutions
            outside  the  Triangle area.  More than 10,000 computers and
            workstations are interconnected across North Carolina.

            CONCERT-CONNECT

            CONCERT-CONNECT, a program of the MCNC Center for Communica-
            tions,  provides  North  Carolina businesses and industry an
            opportunity to gain access to state  and  national  research
            and  education  resources  through  the  INTERNET.  CONCERT-
            CONNECT can provide a company a significant competitive edge
            in research and development.

            Businesses and industry interested in connecting to  CONCERT
            can  use the network for collaboration, research, and educa-
            tion.  Network connection  provides  users  with  access  to
            email, bulletin boards, various databases, and other network
            and institutional resources.  Connection to CONCERT  can  be
            achieved  by  direct  network  connection  at  56 Kbps or T1
            speeds, or by three  dial-up  modem  services:  Serial  Line
            Internet  Protocol  (SLIP);   individual UNIX accounts; UUCP
            Mail/News.

            COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH

            The primary purpose of the research activities is to  lever-
            age the evolution of CONCERT to support advanced educational
            uses of the network and  communications  research  in  North
            Carolina.   The existing network and established userbase is
            utilized as a testbed, and the  focus  of  the  research  is
            joint activities among MCNC, the universities, and industry.
            Projects tend to emphasize use of standard network technolo-
            gies,   supercomputing   communications   applications,  and
            methods to use networking to enable collaboration by provid-
            ing virtual proximity capabilities.

            Currently Funded Projects:

               o+  Atila-development of  a  prototype  network  analysis-
                  evaluation-management system for Asynchronous Transfer

            SWITCH is a foundation, sponsored by the government and  the
            Swiss  universities,  providing  teleinformatics services to
            all Swiss universities and to various research institutes by
            connecting  to  national and international resources. SWITCH
            started operation in October 1988.

            SWITCHlan is a national backbone network which connects  all
            universities   using   leased   lines  with  speeds  between
            128 kbit/s  and   2 Mbit/s.   Most  other  organizations are
            connected  via  64 kbit/sec.   For routing on these national
            leased  lines  SWITCH  uses  CISCO  routers.  The  protocols
            supported are DECnet, TCP/IP, X.25 and ISO CLNS.

            All three Swiss supercomputers are connected  to  SWITCHlan.
            Access to some library catalogs is already available; others
            will join later.

            International  connections  on   the   network   level  went
            into operation in January 1990. The current state today is:

               o+  Two lines with TCP/IP to CERN, each  2  Mbit/s.   This
                  gives access to the European part of the  Internet and
                  access to the NSFnet via the EASIgate T1 link to  Cor-
                  nell.

                  with  64kbit/s;  this  link is the backup route to the
                  Internet/NSFnet.

               o+  A TCP/IP 64  kbit/sec  line  to  BelWue,   a  regional
                  research network in southern Germany.

            A 64 kbit/sec  connection to the COSINE/IXI pilot X.25  net-
            work has been   running   since   the   first   quarter   of
            1990.  This infrastructure  is  mainly used  for  exchanging
            X.400  messages,  connecting   to  other  X.500 DSAs and for
            TCP/IP over X.25 and ISO CLNS over  X.25  with   the   Euro-
            pean Academic and Research Community.

            SWITCHmail is  the  national X.400 MHS network  which   con-
            nects  the   universities   and   research institutes to the
            ADMD of the Swiss PTT and through COSINE-MHS to research MHS
            networks    in   19   countries.     E-mail    gateways   to
            EARN/BITNET,  UUCP  and Internet are also offered by SWITCH.

            In  RARE  (Reseaux   Associes  pour  la  Recherche   Europe-
            enne,  the European  research  network organisation), SWITCH
            is an active partner  in  the  COSINE MHS  project  as  well
            as  in  the COSINE pilot   X.500   Directory   Service  pro-

            BARRNet is the  Northern  California  regional  hub  of  the
            NSFNet,  the National Science Foundation Network.  BARRNet's
            purpose is to facilitate scientific and educational communi-
            cations  using high-performance computer networking technol-
            ogy and wide-area telecommunications utilities, and to  pro-
            mote  collaboration, sharing of information, and wide access
            to computer resources for research and educational purposes.
            BARRNet  was  established in 1986 under a grant from the NSF
            by a consortium of six  members:  Stanford  University,  the
            NASA Ames Research Center, and the Berkeley, Santa Cruz, San
            Francisco, and Davis campuses of the University of  Califor-
            nia.   Since then BARRNet has grown to include several addi-
            tional government and private research laboratories and more
            than twenty-five corporate affiliates.

            Four BARRNet sites-UC  Berkeley,  Stanford  University,  the
            Lawrence  Livermore  National  Laboratory, and NASA Ames-are
            connected in a ring by data circuits  running  at  T1  speed
            (1.544  Mbps).   UC Davis, which is connected to UC Berkeley
            by a T1 line, is also considered a core site;  the remaining
            sites  are  connected to one of the core sites, typically by
            T1 or 56kbps lines, but in some cases by microwave or direct
            Ethernet (10 Mbps) connections.  BARRNet is connected to the
            NSFNET by an NSS  (Nodal  Switching  Subsystem)  located  at
            Stanford  University.   Stanford  is  also  the  site of the
            BARRNet Network Operating Center, or NOC.

            Beginning in April of 1990, BARRNet's membership  fees  will
            be  adjusted  to  reflect  size and type of organization, as
            well as connection speed.  Also during the spring and summer
            of  1990,  BARRNet will be implementing low-speed (9600 bps)
            dedicated line services,  with  dial-up  services  available
            shortly thereafter.

            An  Administrative  Committee   oversees   BARRNet   policy,
            finances,  and  general  operations.   A Technical Committee
            advises the Administrative Committee, and  oversees  day-to-
            day operations such as routing.

            NorthWestNet  is  a  regional  (mid-level)  network  of  the
            National  Science Foundation Network (NSFNet) providing com-
            munication with NSFNet for knowledge-based organizations  in
            Alaska,   Washington,  Oregon,  Idaho,  Montana,  and  North
            Dakota.  Member organizations include higher  education  and
            K-12   institutions,   scientific  laboratories,  libraries,
            health care facilities, and industrial research units.   The
            mission  of  NorthWestNet is to promote research, education,
            and economic development by providing access to network com-
            munications,  computing  and  electronic information systems
            and services throughout the Northwest.  Financial support of
            NorthWestNet  comes  from  National Science Foundation (NSF)
            grants, institutional membership dues, and  network  service
            fees.    NorthWestNet   is   a  not-for-profit  organization
            operated by the  Northwest  Academic  Computing  Consortium,
            Inc.  (NWACC).   This  consortium of NorthWestNet members is
            governed by a Board of Directors  elected  from  representa-
            tives  of  member  organizations.  There are three operating
            committees made up of  member  organization  representatives
            focusing  on  Management,  Technical Services, and User Ser-
            vices.

            The Technical Services Committee is responsible for  review-
            ing  and  recommending  technical directions of the network.

            SUNET, or  the  Swedish  University  Network,  interconnects
            local  and  regional networks at universities in Sweden. The
            goal of SUNET is to provide good  data  communications  that
            are  beneficial to the universities.  The network is used by
            researchers and teachers of all disciplines.  SUNET provides
            Swedish  academic  and research users with network resources
            for communications both within Sweden and around  the  world
            through  electronic  mail,  remote login, file transfer, and
            other methods.

            SUNET is a protocol-independent network  based  on  Ethernet
            (IEEE  802.3) interconnections. Currently only IP and DECnet
            (and EARN) are carried over the backbone. The  configuration
            of  SUNET  is  a  backbone  star  network centered at KTH in
            Stockholm with 64 kbps lines interconnecting the local  Eth-
            ernets  to one nation wide Ethernet. The lines are intercon-
            nected via remote bridges (Vitalink). Routers  are  used  to
            support  the  various  protocols: Cisco for IP and VAXes for
            DECnet (and EARN). SUNET also maintains a separate X.25 net-
            work.

            There are two interconnected  central  mail  hubs,  one  for
            IP/SMTP, RSCS/BSMTP and VMS/Mail and one for EAN/X.400 mail.

            There are (at least) 3000 IP hosts and 650 DECnets in SUNET.

            The Texas Higher Education Network (THEnet)  was  formed  in
            1986  through  a  combination of networking efforts at Texas
            A&M University, the University of Houston, the University of
            Texas  Health Science Center at San Antonio, and the Univer-
            sity of Texas System.  It covers the state of Texas, with  a
            link  to  the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores
            de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.  THEnet's goal is to pro-
            vide  and  advance the electronic exchange of information in
            support of the teaching, research, development, and  related
            collaborative  activities  of the Texas higher education and
            research communities.

            THEnet is not a homogeneous network utilizing a single  net-
            working  protocol.   Rather it is a network of physical con-
            nections between and within organizations making various use
            of  IP,  DECnet, SNA, RSCS/NJE, and compressed digital video
            It provides researchers, faculty, and students the  network-
            ing  "tools" that they need for their particular situations.
            THEnet currently connects over 80 institutions, and consists

            ILAN, the Israeli Academic Network, established in 1984,  is
            dedicated  to  universities  and academic, medical, and non-
            profit research institutes.  The network is widely used  for
            scientific,  educational,  academic,  and research purposes:
            commercial and political use is not allowed, either directly
            or indirectly.

            ILAN has installed six 64kb lines to create a central  high-
            speed  backbone  between  Israel's seven major universities.
            ILAN has international connections to EARN and Nysernet.

            ILAN's former NJE traffic and all EARN/Bitnet  network  ser-
            vices  now  run  on  ILAN's TCP/IP backbone.  We plan a 56kb
            link  to  Nysernet  (the  New  York  State  Educational  and
            Research  Network),  a  regional  network  of NSFNET (the US
            National Science Foundation Network).  In the interim,  ILAN
            will connect to Nysernet via a 9.6kb IP link.

            Our backbone supports "Aleph," a project for the  computeri-
            zation  and  interconnection  of all university library card
            catalogs, which is near to completion.  This  system  allows
            students  and  faculty  to  search  card  catalogs  at local
            university libraries as well as libraries located  at  other
            universities within Israel.  Since this system was developed
            long before  the  ILAN  project,  it  was  based  on  DECNET

            ESnet is a computer data communications network managed  and
            funded by the Department of Energy Office of Energy Research
            (DOE/OER) for the  purpose  of  supporting  open  scientific
            research in multiple programs.  ESnet is intended to facili-
            tate access to resources at  ER  scientific  facilities,  to
            provide  for information dissemination among scientific col-
            laborators  throughout  all  ER  programs,  and  to  provide
            widespread  access  to existing supercomputer facilities via
            remote login, electronic mail, file  transfer,  and  related
            utilities.

            ESnet is installed  and  operated  by  the  National  Energy
            Supercomputer Center (NERSC), formerly known as the National
            Magnetic Fusion Energy Computer Center  (NMFECC),  which  is
            located  at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in
            California.  ESnet policy is guided by  the  ESnet  Steering
            Committee, appointed by the DOE Office of Scientific Comput-
            ing, with representatives from each of the  Energy  Research
            Programs.   The ESnet program plan, prepared by this commit-
            tee, is available from the  National  Technical  Information
            Service as report DOE/ER-0341 (June 1987).

            The ESnet backbone consists of largely of  T1  links  (1.544
            megabit  per  second)  interconnecting nineteen sites in the
            United States.  Network access to Europe and Japan  is  also
            supplied  in collaboration with foreign research facilities.

            The California Education and  Research  Federation  Network,
            CERFnet,  is  a  data  communications  regional network that
            operates throughout California.  The purpose of  CERFnet  is
            to  advance  science  and  education by assisting the inter-
            change of information among research and educational  insti-
            tutions through high-speed data communications techniques.

            CERFnet was launched in the spring of 1989 with a $2.8  mil-
            lion  grant  from  the National Science Foundation.  CERFnet
            links fifty of the leading research and education centers in
            California  at  data  transfer rates of up to 1.544 megabits
            per second (T1).  The CERFnet backbone nodes are located  at
            UCLA,  UC  Irvine,  SDSC,  Caltech, and the UC Office of the
            President in Oakland,  California.   CERFnet  membership  is
            open  to  all  organizations  in  California,  including any
            university, college, industrial or government facility, hos-
            pital, or library.

            CERFnet offers several different connection options.  A CERF
            1544  (1.544 Mbps), CERF 56 (56 kbps) or CERF 9.6 (9.6 kbps)
            entitles the  subscriber  to  a  dedicated  leased  circuit.
            CERFnet  offers  DIAL N' CERF, a dial-up SLIP service to the
            network.  DIAL N' CERF subscribers connect to the network by
            dialing  up  the  nearest  backbone node and logging on to a
            CERFnet terminal server.

            The Merit staff operates a gateway between the Internet  and
            SprintMail,  which  allows  messages to be exchanged between
            SprintMail customers and Internet  users.   The  gateway  is
            connected  to  Sprintnet and to the Internet through Merit's
            connections to the NSFNET.

            SprintMail, operated by Sprint International, is  a  commer-
            cial  X.400 electronic mail network providing services to US
            customers and access  to  other  networks  domestically  and
            internationally.   Formerly  known  as  Telemail, SprintMail
            uses the Sprintnet (formerly Telenet)  public  data  network
            for its e-mail connections.

            Merit  provides  hardware  and  software   maintenance   and
            administration and network operations (via the Merit Network
            Operations Center) for the Internet gateway; Sprint provides
            Sprintnet connectivity and user consulting and registration,
            as well as gateways to other X.400 networks.

            The gateway is a Sun SPARCstation-I running Sun OS 4.0.3 and
            Sunlink  MHS.  An X.25 link to Sprintnet is connected to the
            Sun's serial port at 9600 bps.   Protocols  used  are  X.400
            Message  Handling  System,  X.225 session layer, X.224 tran-
            sport class 0, and X.25. On the Internet  side,  the  Simple
            Mail Transfer Protocol (RFC-822), Transfer Control Protocol,
            Internet Protocol, and Ethernet protocols are used.

            The  gateway  supports  a  directory  function  that  allows
            SprintMail  customers  to be registered with a mnemonic name
            which can be used  by  Internet  users  when  sending  mail.
            SprintMail  users  who  wish  to register can contact Sprint
            Customer Service.

            Merit provides domain name service for the SPRINT.COM domain
            as  well  as  for  some  other  domains  on  behalf  of some
            SprintMail customers.  For example, the COMPMAIL.COM  domain
            is owned by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic
            Engineering) Computer Society but is operated  by  Merit  as
            part of the gateway function.

                 John.Doe@Sprint.COM

            Alternatively, the full X.400 Originator/Recipient (OR) name
            can be specified, (all on one line), for example:

                 /pn=John.Doe/admd=Telemail/o=Sprintintl/c=us/@Sprint.COM

            The  Internet  host  name  after  the  at-sign,  @,  can  be
            SPRINT.COM or another domain supported by the Merit gateway.
            X.400  OR  names  consist  of a list of parameters and their
            values.  X.400 parameters in OR names that can  be  used  by
            the SprintMail gateway include:


            ADMD    Administrative Management Domain
            PRMD    Private Management Domain
            PN      Personal Name
            G       Given Name
            S       Surname
            DD.UN   User Name (DD is "Domain Defined")
            O       Organization
            C       Country (two-letter abbreviations must be used, for example, US, GB, JP)


            From SprintMail to the Internet
            When sending mail from the SprintMail X.400  environment  to
            the  Internet,  the  native  syntax  of  the sender's system
            should be used.  Use an "ADMD" of TELEMAIL, "PRMD" of INTER-
            NET  and  "Country"  of US, along with the "RFC-822" "domain

            defined" attribute  to  specify  the  user's  Internet  mail
            address.  For example, to send mail from the SprintMail sys-
            tem   to    an    Internet    user    whose    address    is
            jdoe@engin.college.edu, type (all on one line):

                 (Site:Internet,ID:<jdoe(a)engin.college.edu>)

            The angle brackets "< >" are required.  The  "(a)"  replaces
            the  at-sign, @, because that and most other special charac-
            ters are illegal as specified in RFC  987,  which  makes  it
            necessary  to  substitute "(u)" for underscore, _, "(b)" for
            bang (exclamation point), !, "(q)" for a quotation mark,  ",
            and "(p)" for percent, %.

            Resolving Problems

            If a message sent across the gateway  cannot  be  delivered,
            the  gateway will send a return message to notify the sender
            of nondelivery.  That notification message will explain  the
            problem  with  the  mail address.  If you have further ques-
            tions, call or send e-mail to Sprint Customer Service.

            SDSCnet is a network that links  academic,  industrial,  and
            government  affiliates  with  the  San  Diego  Supercomputer
            Center (SDSC) and, by extension, with NSFNET.

            Participating organizations may use  the  network  to  login
            remotely  to  SDSC's  supercomputer,  parallel machines, and
            visualization resources;  transfer files; send  and  receive
            electronic  mail;  and connect to other resources on NSFNET.
            Some organizations also receive  software  support.   If  an
            organization's  network  device(s) support(s) SNMP, the link
            is monitored for outages 24 hours/day seven days/week.

            Connections to SDSCnet are dedicated links primarily  at  56
            Kbps  and  T1  speeds  using the TCP/IP or DECnet protocols.
            (OSI protocols will be added when  they  become  available.)
            Links  to  BITNET  are  also available for institutions that
            wish it and that qualify as members of CREN.

            industrial,  or  government  organization not otherwise con-
            nected to NSFNET that seeks such  a  connection.   The  cost
            depends  on the preferred speed, network device, protocol of
            the connection, and the types of services required.

            CSUNET (California State University Network) spans the state
            of  California.  Its membership consists of the twenty Cali-
            fornia State University campuses, five California  Community
            Colleges, and the California Department of Education.

            CSUNET has four T1 connection points with the Internet,  two
            with  BARRNet  (Stanford and UC Davis), one with CERFnet (UC
            Irvine) and one with SDSCnet/CERFnet (SDSC). CSUNET also has
            X.25  packet connections to SprintNet and 9600-baud X.25 and
            Telnet dial-up access for  limited  CSU-sponsored  programs.
            Between  the  CSU  campuses,  CSUNET  also  supports DECnet,
            Appletalk, and SNA, along with TCP/IP.

            In 1988, partial funding was received from the National Sci-
            ence  Foundation  for cisco routers.  Today, however, CSUNET
            is funded entirely by the State of California in support  of
            K-12, community college, and university-level education.

            Logical and geographic maps of CSUNET  are  located  in  the
            csunet/maps subdirectory at "nic.csu.net" (130.150.102.20).

            WiscNet is a nonprofit association that provides  access  to
            national  network  resources  for  higher education institu-
            tions, mostly in the state of Wisconsin.  The  primary  pur-
            pose  of  WiscNet  is  to  provide  access  to the Internet.
            WiscNet provides no direct services to end users, but rather
            acts as a conduit to the resources of the Internet and makes
            possible interchange of information  using  electronic  mail
            and network news.

            WiscNet is governed by a board of  directors  consisting  of
            one member from each charter member institution plus the NSF
            proposal investigators.  The board is reponsible for setting
            broad operating policy, establishing direction, establishing
            membership categories, and  assessing  membership  fees.   A
            Network Planning Committee works with the operating agent on
            network design issues.

            The Madison Academic Computing Center at the UW-Madison pro-
            vides  day-to-day  operational  support  for  WiscNet.  This
            includes a Network Operation Center  that  provides  problem
            reporting  and resolution services 24 hour a day, 365 days a
            year.

            WiscNet operates a  packet-switched  network  consisting  of
            routers  connected  by  T1  (1.544  Mbps)  and DDS (56 Kbps)

            communications lines.  This  network  is  connected  to  the
            national network at UW-Madison by two T1 lines.

            The network backbone consists of cisco AGS  routers  located
            at  UW-Eau Claire, UW-Madison, UW-Milwaukee, UW-Oshkosh, and
            UW-Stevens Point.  These backbone  routers  are  redundantly
            connected  by  256-Kbps  circuits  provided  by the State of
            Wisconsin Department of Administration's  Consolidated  Data
            Network  (CDN).  End node sites are connected to the nearest
            backbone sites in their LATA by 56-Kbps DDS circuits.

            WiscNet is connected to the  CICNet  (Big  Ten  universities
            plus  the  University  of  Chicago)  regional network at UW-
            Madison by T1 lines to the University of  Minnesota  and  to
            Argonne National Laboratory.

            The Australian Academic and Research Network (AARNet)  is  a
            national  network  that interconnects the major academic and
            research facilities within Australia.  The network  connects
            all Australian universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and
            Industrial and Research Organisation (CSIRO), and many other
            government,  commercial,  and industrial research facilities
            in Australia.

            Internally the network uses a  mix  of  2-mbit  and  48-kbit
            leased  lines and multi-protocol routers to provide the con-
            nection infrastructure.

            The network supports national TCP/IP  and  DECnet  Phase  IV
            services. The TCP/IP network is interconnected to the Inter-
            net via a PACCOM link to FIX-West at Mountain View, Califor-
            nia.   At  time  of  writing  this international link uses a
            256-kbit satellite circuit.

            UNINETT is the Norwegian academic and research data network.
            Its  purpose is to support research and education and colla-
            borative work in and among academic and non-profit  research
            organizations in Norway by providing access to computer net-
            works and network resources. As the Norwegian branch of  the
            Internet,  EARN/BITNET,  the  European  academic DECnet, and
            OSInet/IXI, UNINETT offers a variety of services  connecting
            the  Norwegian  academic society to the rest of the academic
            world.

            Electronic mail, file transfer, terminal  access,  directory
            services,  USENET  Network  News  and the Gopher information
            service are among the services available on the UNINETT net-
            work.

            By March 1993, about 170 academic and research organizations
            are  connected  to the UNINETT backbone, giving national and
            international connection to some 19700 IP hosts, a few  hun-
            dred DECnet hosts and X.400 MTAs, and 3 EARN/BITNET nodes.

            UNINETT is a member of  NORDUnet,  which  is  a  cooperative
            effort  of  the academic networks in all of the Nordic coun-
            tries and is connected internationally through the  NORDUnet
            network.

            ARNET, a TCP/IP network connected to the  Internet,  is  the
            major  science  and  research network of Argentina.  It con-
            nects approximately three hundred sites, mainly universities
            and research organizations.  ARNET provides electronic mail,
            USENET News, file server, and electronic mailing  list  ser-
            vices.

            Like other cooperative networks, ARNET has no central  plan-
            ning  or  central authority.  The current international link
            and the top-level AR domain are managed by the UNDP  (United
            Nations  Development  Programme), Project ARG-86-026, at the
            Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MREC), together with the Secre-
            tariat  of  Science  and  Technology  (SECYT).  For the time
            being, the top-level  subdomains  are  administered  by  the
            UNDP/MREC project.

            ARNET is a store-and-forward message network  based  on  the
            Unix  communications  facilities.   The  international elec-
            tronic mail gateway and USENET news backbone, atina.ar, is a
            '386  machine  running  Unix  System V connected to the MREC
            Local Area Network.  The network is connected to the  Inter-
            net through a satellite link to SURANet at the University of
            _________________________

            Most ARNET connections are over the public telephone network
            or  the  public  packet-switching  network, ARPAC, using the
            UUCP protocol in different environments.   USENET  news  and
            most  electronic  mail  traffic  is  brought  to  ARNET from
            uunet.uu.net via Internet.

            Several major nodes, such  as  secyt.gov.ar  (Secretaria  de
            Ciencia y Tecnologia), dcfcen.edu.ar (Departamento de Compu-
            tacion, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales,  Universi-
            dad de Buenos Aires), and opsarg.org.ar (Organizacion Panam-
            ericana de la Salud), call atina.ar  over  telephone  lines,
            PSN  ARPAC,  or  leased  lines  to  distribute mail and news
            traffic to other nodes.  Many nodes use various  implementa-
            tions of UUCP for MS-DOS with limited functionality.

            Future plans

            There is a cooperation agreement between the UNDP/MREC  pro-
            ject  and  the  SECYT  to distribute Internet services.  The
            first stage will be the installation of  a  couple  of  Unix
            boxes  at  major  regional sites, interconnected through the
            PSN ARPAC and national  satellite  links  using  UUCP.   The
            second  stage  will  be  the  migration from UUCP to TCP/IP.
            There are under study different ways to distribute  Internet
            services throughout the country, and to upgrade the interna-
            tional link to the Internet.

            ARNET's IP number is 140.191.  Several bits of  the  address
            are   reserved   for   subnetting.    The   subnet  mask  is
            255.255.254.0.

            The current MX-host  for  the  AR  domain  is  uunet.uu.net.
            Domain Name Service for AR domain is served by NS.UU.NET and
            UUCP-GW-1.PA.DEC.COM.  Most systems on ARNET use the  Inter-
            net addressing scheme and the UUCP bang notation.

            TANet, the Taiwan  Academic  Network,  is  a  pilot  project
            undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of Education and Universities
            Computer Center to establish a common national academic net-
            work  infrastructure.   To  support  research  and  academic
            institutions in Taiwan, TANet will provide access to  unique
            resources  and  opportunities for collaborative work.  TANet
            will be composed of most of the Taiwan  Internet  community,
            including   industry  networks  such  as  SEEDNet  (Software
            Engineering Environment Development Network).

            Network Organization:

            The management structure of TANet is a two-layer  hierarchy.
            The  TANet network service center (TANSC) is to be responsi-
            ble for the national  backbone  network  and  management  of
            international  links.  Within each regional area, a regional
            network service center (RNSC) will  provide  necessary  ser-
            vices and support connections to the TANet backbone from the
            local-area     network/campus      network      of      each
            university/institution.   At  present,  TANSC  is run by the
            Ministry of Education computer center, and each RNSC is  run
            by a major local university.

                  National Sun-Yat Sen University (NSYSU)
                  National Kaohsiung Normal University (NKNU)

               These bodies are the core  membership  of  TANet.   Other
               university/institutions  may  apply for membership and be
               connected  to  TANet  after  obtaining  their  membership
               application.

               Protocols:



            July 31, 1992               NNSC       Section 5.44,  Page 2








               The network protocols will initially focus on  TCP/IP  on
               the TANet backbone.  Regional networks may support multi-
               ple pro- tocols and additional facilities (including X.25
               transport or dial-up services) on a local basis in accor-
               dance with regional requirements.  Support for OSI (CLNS)
               routing  will be introduced in the near future.  Existing
               Taiwan BITNET and ifNET  (information  NETwork)  applica-
               tions  (including  electronic mail delivery, NetNEWS, and
               file transfer) will be supported over TANet via  IP  con-
               nections.

               Network Topology:

               The network implementation uses a ring/mesh topology.  It
               interconnects   by  intelligent  routers  and  high-speed
               leased circuits/LANs together.

               High-speed  T1  (1.544  Mbps)  circuits  were   installed
               between  NSYSU and NTU, MOECC, NCU, NCTU, NTHU, and NCKU.
               NTU, NTHU, NCHU, and NCKU are now  9.6  kbps  for  backup
               purposes  (they  will  be  changed to at least 64 kbps in
               1992).  Dynamic ISDN links are also intended  to  provide
               backup  services  in  the  event  of failure of a primary
               link.  The bandwidth of each local link  will  depend  on
               its  local requirements;  global considerations will dic-
               tate further moves toward higher bandwidths on the  back-
               bone links.

               A 64 kbps link is now installed from the Ministry of Edu-
               cation  Computer Center to Princeton University, and will
               be upgarded to 256 kbps before the  end  of  1992.   This
               link will couple TANet to both JvNCnet and NSFNET..kp

            OARnet is the regional network for the state  of  Ohio.   It
            serves  the higher education community, providing Ohio scho-
            lars access to colleagues worldwide.  OARnet  also  provides
            commercial connectivity to industrial and commercial members
            with unrestricted traffic flow between other OARnet  members
            and the Internet.  Libraries, databases, national and inter-
            national laboratories, and research centers are  accessible,
            helping make Ohio schools competitive.

            The Ohio Academic Resources Network (OARnet) was established
            in  1987  to  provide statewide access to the Cray supercom-
            puter at the Ohio Supercomputer Center.  Since then  it  has
            evolved into a network supporting all aspects of higher edu-
            cation in Ohio.  A primary goal of OARnet is  to  facilitate
            collaborative  projects  and  sharing  of  resources between
            institutions, including those  outside  the  state.   OARnet
            connections  are available to Ohio academic institutions and
            corporations engaged in  reseach,  product  development,  or
            instruction.    Colleges,   universities,   and   industries
            currently use OARnet connections to communicate  within  the
            state and with colleagues around the country.

            EMBnet is a project to develop the infrastructure for access
            to  biotechnology information services for the research com-
            munity in Europe. The project includes the  formation  of  a
            network for access to, and exchange and analysis of, data of
            importance to molecular biology and biotechnology.

            The network is  based  on  nationally-appointed  centres  in
            European  countries,  appropriately  staffed and equipped to
            provide a biocomputing service and to develop  network-based
            services within their country. Additional nodes are involved
            as hosts of databases  or  specialised  facilities.  Current
            nodes and their contact representatives are listed below.

            Initial network activities have centred around daily distri-
            bution  of  nucleotide  sequence  data  from  the  EMBL Data
            Library using Internet,  and  sometimes  DECnet  over  X.25.
            National  EMBnet  nodes  therefore maintain remote copies of
            the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database for on-line access  of
            further re-distribution within their country.

            One main goal is to develop bioinformatics and its  practice
            in  general.   Approaches  and solutions are discussed among
            the project members via mailing  lists,  newsgroups  and  at
            annual workshops.

            Other activities and projects include promotion of  computer
            conferencing,  remote  access  to specialised facilities (eg
            sequence similarity searching on massively parallel  comput-
            ers), a training programme in bioinformatics, evaluation and
            implementation of Gopher servers, remote  sequence  database
            updating mechanisms.

            In most cases the services provided  by  national  nodes  of
            EMBnet  are  intended for their national research community.
            In some cases there is a  charging  system,  especially  for
            commercial  users.  Other  entries  in the Internet Resource
            Guide  (eg  EMBL  Data  Library)  will  give  more  specific
            details, or contact the resource directly.

            EMBnet received financial support from the  EC  BRIDGE  pro-
            gramme,  1991-94.   Major  financial  support is received by
            most of the national nodes to establish and run  their  ser-
            vices.

            In 1990, the UK Medical Research Council (MRC)  founded,  as
            part of the UK Human Genome Mapping Project, a Resource Cen-
            tre (HGMP-RC) at the Clinical Research Centre (CRC), Harrow,
            Middlesex.   The  objectives of the HGMP-RC computing are to
            establish and make available  databases  of  genes,  genetic
            markers  and  map  locations,  and  to develop new computing
            environments and methods for  acquisition  and  analysis  of
            such   data.    Computing  and  networking  facilities  were
            developed by the MRC to provide online computing support  to
            the Project.

            The facilities are connected to a number of other  computing
            systems   in  centres  of  genetics  and  molecular  biology
            research excellence worldwide through national and  interna-
            tional  wide  area  networks  (WAN's) including the European
            Research Backbone Network  (EBONE),  INTERNET,  Public  Data
            Networks  (Packet  Switching  and  Telephone)  in the UK and
            overseas, research and academic networks in the UK and over-
            seas,  European  Molecular Biology Network (EMBNet) and oth-
            ers. Direct connectivity to US laboratories was  implemented
            using a high-speed communication link, the UK-US 'fat pipe'.

            A great deal of effort has been spent on improving  services
            to  the scientific community.  Molecular genetics databases,
            application  software   and   miscellaneous   services   are

            Advanced Network & Services is a U.S.-based network  service
            provider  that  offers  connections  to  the  Internet  at a
            variety of bandwidth levels, including 56 Kb/s, T1, 10  Mb/s
            and  T3.   Currently,  ANS has the only nationwide computing
            network operating at higher than T1 speeds.   ANS  began  by
            serving only sites sponsored by the National Science Founda-
            tion, and the NSFNET remains the largest segment of the  ANS
            network.  However, today the company provides enterprise and
            gateway attachment  services  to  commercial  organizations,
            including  other  network and information service providers,
            as well as research and education institutions  and  govern-
            ment  agencies.   The fiber optic transmission facilities of
            the ANS network are provided by interexchange carriers,  and
            the  core nodes of the network are co-located at the carrier
            points of presence (POPs),  which  are  staffed  around  the
            clock.   The  network's  operations center is located at Ann
            Arbor, Michigan, and also provides continuous service.

            agencies that have signed the ANS Acceptable Use  Policy  as
            part  of  their  contractual agreements with ANS are free to
            use the company's network to send  and  receive  information

            The Network Information Center (NIC)  is  located  in  Chan-
            tilly,  VA,  and is managed by Network Solutions of Herndon,
            VA (as sub-contractors to Government Services, Inc.) The NIC
            host  computer is a SUN 470 which runs the SUN 4.2 operating
            System.  The NICs hostname is NIC.DDN.MIL and  its  Internet
            address is 192.112.36.5.  The NIC provides general user ser-
            vices via telephone, electronic mail, and U.S. postal  mail.
            The  NIC  operates  a  toll  free  telephone  service Monday
            through Friday from 7AM to 7PM Eastern  Standard  Time.   In
            addition to the telephone service, the NIC maintains several
            role mail boxes to answer user questions  via  E-mail.   The
            telephone numbers and mail boxes are listed below:

               Toll-Free: 1-800-365-3642

                                      tion and support


            The NIC works closely with network Host Administrators, Node
            Site  Coordinators, domain administrators, network coordina-
            tors, network protocol groups, vendors, contractors, govern-
            ment agencies, and military sponsors to assist new users and
            potential subscribers in obtaining pertinent network  infor-
            mation.

            The  NIC  provides  databases  and  information  servers  of
            interest to network users, including the WHOIS "white pages"
            registry, the NIC/Query browsing system,  TACNEWS,  and  the
            official  DoD  Host  Name Service. The NIC is the source for
            official DDN protocol documents (other than  the  MIL-STDs),
            as  well  as  other  DDN  documents,  and  maintains the RFC
            (Request for Comments) collection.  Many of the online files
            are  available  through  the  NIC's  automatic mail service,
            SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL.

            The NIC registers hosts  and  domains,  assigns  IP  network
            numbers and Autonomous System Numbers, and provides hostname
            translation tables and domain name system  server  files  to
            the  DDN Internet.  The NIC also registers network users and
            issues MILNET TAC access cards.

            ONLINE FILES

            The NIC maintains many online files that  are  available  to
            network  subscribers via the file transfer protocol (FTP) or
            Kermit.  These files contain  information  about  protocols,
            site  personnel,  hosts, and other subjects relevant to net-
            work users.  See the file netinfo/00netinfo-index.txt for an
            index  to  the files in the netinfo directory.  See also the
            DDN New User Guide or contact the NIC User  Assistance  ser-
            vice  for more information. Other publicly accessible direc-
            tories include PROTOCOLS, RFC, IEN, SCC, and DDN-NEWS.  Each
            of   these   directories   has   an   index  in  the  format
            00directory-index.txt or  directory-index.txt  in  order  to
            allow users to quickly identify the files they need.

            REGISTRATION SERVICES

            The NIC is responsible for the registration of users, hosts,



            July 8, 1992                NNSC        Section 6.2,  Page 2








            domains,  IP network numbers, and autonomous systems numbers
            (ASNs) for organizations connected to the DDN Internet.

            To register a new user with  the  NIC,  send  a  request  to
            registrar@nic.ddn.mil,  the  NIC's  role  mailbox  for  user
            registrations.  The template for user registration data  can
            be  found in the online file netinfo/user-template.txt.  The
            NIC registers users from the Military  Community,  primarily
            by  accepting  and  processing  templates  from  MILNET host
            administrators. These requests often  involve  TAC  Access--
            i.e.,  dialup  access to a MILNET host via a Terminal Access
            Controller.  The NIC issues and distributes TAC Access Cards
            to  users  who  require  the  service.   In general, the NIC
            registers users from the Internet community only if they are
            POCs for a domain or a network.

            To include a new host in the DDN  Internet  Host  Table,  an
            administrator   must   complete   the   template   found  in
            netinfo/ihost-template.txt   file   and   return    it    to
            HOSTMASTER@NIC.DDN.MIL.  To be included in the Host Table, a
            host must act as a domain or IN-ADDR server, be  a  gateway,
            or be essential for mail routing.

            Twice weekly, host information is  generated  into  the  DDN
            Internet Host Table as netinfo/hosts.txt, which is a listing
            of the hosts, gateways, and networks attached to the  Inter-
            net  and registered with the NIC.  From this file, two addi-
            tional files are generated: hosts.txt.Z, a  UNIX  compressed
            version of the hosts.txt file; and mil-hosts.txt, a complete
            listing of MILNET hosts from the hosts.txt file.

            Domains are registered via the domain template found in  the
            NIC  online  file  netinfo/domain-template.txt.   New domain
            information is installed in the seven DNS root servers twice
            weekly.    Information  on  the  root  servers  is  kept  in
            netinfo/root-servers.txt.  The domains registered  with  the
            NIC are listed in netinfo/domain-info.txt.  A listing of the
            netaddresses of the domain servers for individual  top-level
            domains can be found in netinfo/domains.txt.

            To obtain an IP network number  assignment,  a  network  POC
            must   complete  the  template  in  netinfo/internet-number-
            template.txt and returns the template  to  HOSTMASTER.   The
            file   netinfo/networks.txt  contains  a  complete  list  of
            government-sponsored networks.

            Address-to-hostname inverse resolution is  accomplished  via
            IN-ADDR  domains,  which  are  registered in the domain root



            July 8, 1992                NNSC        Section 6.2,  Page 3








            servers via an IN-ADDR template sent to the HOSTMASTER mail-
            box.   This  template is located in the file netinfo/inaddr-
            template.txt.

            To obtain an autonomous system numbers (ASNs) assignment,  a
            user  must  complete  the  template  found  in  netinfo/asn-
            template.txt  and  submit  it   to   HOSTMASTER@NIC.DDN.MIL.
            Assigned ASNs are listed in netinfo/asn.txt.

            POC  information  on  individuals  who   are   not   already
            registered  with  the NIC is extracted from domain, network,
            and ASN templates and  automatically  placed  in  the  WHOIS
            database.

            The CSNET Info-Server has been consolidated with  the  Info-
            Server  operated  by  the NSF Network Service Center (NNSC).
            See Section 6.3.

               o+  The   Info-Server:   info-server@nnsc.nsf.net.    This
                  automatic program distributes documents in response to
                  specially formatted messages.  The documents are  also
                  available to Internet users through standard anonymous
                  FTP login.

            For instructions about this and other services, send a  mes-
            sage  to info-server@nnsc.nsf.net with "HELP" in the body of
            the message.

            Other User Services operated by the CSNET CIC were:

               o+  The User Name Server:  Discontinued. There are no plan
                  to revive this service.

               o+  Fixaddr:  This program is a helpful first step in con-
                  verting  mailing  lists  to to up-to-date domain-style
                  addresses.  The NNSC plans restore it if there is suf-
                  ficient demand.

               o+  Nslookup: For hosts that do not have access to  domain
                  servers,  the nslookup program accepts domain names or
                  IP addresses and sends back a message  containing  all
                  domain  nameserver  records  (not  just  the MX ones).
                  This program has been  temporarily  discontinued,  but
                  may be revived in the near future.

            Department of Energy (DOE) is located at the Lawrence Liver-
            more National Laboratory in Livermore, California.  CIAC  is
            the  DOE  crisis center for the handling of computer related
            security incidents.  CIAC rapidly  investigates  reports  of
            possible computer system penetrations, computer viruses, and
            similar problems.  Stopgap software solutions  are  provided
            in  real-time  while  robust binary and source level patches
            are developed.  CIAC distributes information about  computer
            related  threats  to  sites  that may be vulnerable to those
            specific threats. CIAC  also  retains  systems  consultants,
            applications  specialists, and research scientists to assist
            researchers in the security arena.

            As part of a network mapping project, we have implemented  a
            TCP-based  geographic  name  server.  In response to queries
            consisting of a city name and/or ZIP code  and  an  optional
            state  and/or  country  abbreviation, the server retrieves a
            variety of data from a database  containing  information  on
            all  US  cities  (~150,000).  Queries containing UNIX ed(1)-
            style regular expressions are also supported.

            The geographic names database contains state, county,  lati-
            tude and longitude for all US cities.  It also contains 1980
            census population, elevation, area code, and ZIP code for  a
            large  subset  of  the  cities, as well as a small number of
            international cities.   The  database  contains  information
            about  other  geographic  features such as counties, states,
            rivers,  lakes,  summits,  etc.  in  addition  to  populated
            places.

            The raw data were obtained from the United  States  Geodetic
            Survey (USGS) and the US Postal Service.  USGS is developing
            a Geographic Names Information System  (GNIS)  as  the  main
            repository for its ongoing National Gazetteer project.

            The NEST simulation package  developed  at  Columbia  is  an
            environment  for rapid prototyping and simulation of distri-
            buted networked systems.  NEST users can  develop  and  test
            distributed  systems  and  protocols  (from  crude models to
            actual system code) within simulated network scenarios.

            NEST is organized as a simulation  server,  responsible  for
            execution  of  complex  simulation scenarios, and a separate
            graphical   interface   for   simulation    control.     The
            client/server model permits distribution of NEST over a net-
            work environment.  Thus, complex simulations may be migrated
            to  powerful  remote  computational servers.  Alternatively,
            complex studies/development efforts by  multiple  teams  may
            utilize a shared multi-site simulation/integration testbed.

            Simulation servers are created using the NEST library, a  C-
            language library which runs under most Unix variants, and on
            POWER (IBM RS/6000), SPARC, MIPS, 680x0  and  VAX  architec-
            tures.   The  NEST  library  provides  a  simple, high-level
            message-passing facility among a set  of  concurrent  light-
            weight processes which simulate a distributed system.

            The interface provided by the NEST library allows  users  to
            link  in their own C code and run it on one or more nodes in
            a simulated  distributed  environment.   NEST  provides  the

            following operations in this environment:


               o+  send messages to neighboring nodes

               o+  receive messages (optionally, with timestamps)

               o+  check for available messages

               o+  control passage of simulation time

            The user  can  also  provide  C  code  which  simulates  the
            behavior  of  a  channel,  and associate it with one or more
            communications channels.  More  than  one  function  can  be
            associated  with a channel, and the following operations are
            provided:


               o+  alter contents of messages

               o+  control transmission delay of messages

               o+  drop messages (cause them to not be received)

            Finally, a monitor function can be  provided  by  the  user,
            which  runs  periodically in the simulation, and can perform
            modifications to the network scenario as noted below in  the
            description of the NEST generic monitor.    In addition, the
            functionality provided by most available Unix  libraries  is
            accessible within a simulation server.

            Users interact with NEST through the NEST  generic  monitor,
            an X-based graphical interface supporting editing and modif-
            ication of simulation scenarios as well as dynamic  reconfi-
            guration of a simulation during execution.  Thus, it is pos-
            sible to study the dynamic response of a distributed  system
            to failures, burst-loads or other complex dynamical changes.

            The nest monitor provides the following operations for mani-
            pulation of the network simulation scenario:


               o+  create and delete nodes

               o+  create and delete links

               o+  start and stop functions running on nodes




            September 4, 1992           NNSC        Section M.5,  Page 2








               o+  change the function associated with a node

               o+  change the list of channel functions  associated  with
                  an edge

               o+  change the weight parameter associated with an edge

               o+  change the monitor function which runs periodically

               o+  show the current status of a node in the simulation

            NEST includes documentation and complete C source  code  for
            both  the  NEST  library  and the NEST generic monitor.  The
            NEST library will run under most  Unix  variants,  including
            AIX, SunOS, Ultrix, 4.x BSD, and System V.  The NEST generic
            monitor is an X application which uses  the  XView  library.
            The currently released version of NEST is version 2.6.

            FAST is a prototype, automated  broker  for  standard,  off-
            the-shelf  items.   Electronic  and  optical  parts and com-
            ponents and laboratory and test equipment are  readily  pur-
            chased through the FAST service.

            FAST is ONEstop shopping.  It is a complete value-added ser-
            vice that handles quoting, ordering, expediting and returns.
            One purchase order with FAST  allows  customers  to  acquire
            items easily and quickly from a very large vendor base.

            The FAST broker currently serves more than  100  university,
            commercial  and  government  customers.  As of June 1992, it
            had acquired items from over 1,500 suppliers.

            FAST's customers request quotes and place orders  from  FAST
            via EDI (Electronic Data Interchange - standard email or EDI
            X12).  FAST sources (often in  a  fully  automated  fashion)
            incoming  rfqs  and  redistributes them to vendors who carry
            the requested items.

            FAST communicates with its vendors using EDI (standard email
            or  EDI  X12) or fax.  All vendor responses are collected by
            FAST and sent back to the customers via EDI.  The  customers
            pick  the  best quote/item and place the order from FAST via
            EDI.  FAST sends EDI orders for the items  to  the  vendors.
            The vendors invoice FAST and customers reimburse FAST.

            FAST also offers a one-step  quote-and-order  option,  where
            the  customer  specifies what selection criteria FAST should
            use when evaluating  incoming  vendor  quotes.   The  "best"
            quote is then automatically turned into an order by FAST.

            Customers are charged an 8% service fee (8% of the  cost  of
            the merchandise acquired through FAST) for the service.

            The 326-page "VAX Book" attempts to answer most of the ques-
            tions  that  University of Oregon users have had about using
            VMS, EDT, the networks, statistics  and  graphics  packages,
            etc.   Most  of  the  concepts  presented are illustrated by
            means of annotated examples. A detailed  table  of  contents
            and index are included.

            The book is available in either Digital Standard Runoff out-
            put  format  suitable  for printing on a line printer, or in
            PostScript form suitable for printing  on  an  Apple  Laser-
            Writer or other 300 DPI PostScript printer. I am also making
            the raw .RNO files (and the code used to convert  the  guide
            into  TeX)  available for those of you who are interested in
            customizing the "VAX Book" for your own site.

            The CAOS/CAMM Center is the Dutch National Expertise  center
            for   Computer  Assisted  Chemistry,  funded  by  the  Dutch
            National Science Foundation NWO. It is an Academic  Institu-
            tion and it offers chemists an elaborate package of software
            tools, for remote use on a "central" computer system.

            The emphasis is  on  easy  accessibility,  achieved  by  the
            application of menu controlled front-ends and interfaces and
            on integration of the various tools and data bases. An exam-
            ple of the latter is the interconversion of molecular struc-
            ture files between structural databases,  modeling  software
            and  computational  chemistry programs.  All available tools
            are presented to the user in a hierarchy  of  simple  menus,
            where the tools are arranged according to their application.
            The Center supports its users through a combination  of  on-
            line    Help   facilities,   practical   courses   and   the
            (re)production of manuals.  E-mail facilities, NEWS and Con-
            ferencing systems are used to improve the exchange of infor-
            mation  and  experience  among  the  users,  including   the
            Center's picstaff.

            All tools and programs are arranged  in  packages,  covering
            four major chemical areas:

               A:  CAOS (Computer Assisted Organic Synthesis)
                   Available tools are Reaction  Retrieval  Systems  and
                   Fine directories and Synthesis Planning programs.

               B:  CAMM (Computer Assisted Molecular Modeling)
                   Available tools are 3-D Structural data bases  and  a
                   variety of modeling programs.

               C:  CompChem (Computational Chemistry)
                   Available tools are Advanced modeling programs, visu-
                   alization  tools,  the  quantum  chemistry literature
                   database and computational tools for  both  Molecular
                   Mechanics/Dynamics and Quantum Chemical calculations.

               D:  Area   CAMMSA   (Computer   Assisted   Macromolecular
                   Sequence Analysis; BioInformatics)
                   Available tools are all major nucleic acid  and  pro-
                   tein  sequence  data bases and programs for data base
                   query  and  retrieval,  homology  searching,  protein
                   analysis, nucleic acid analysis, alignment and phylo-
                   geny construction.

            Expert help is available on each of the systems supported by
            the  Center.   All  data  bases  supported by the Center are
            updated on a daily,  weekly,  monthly  or  quarterly  basis,
            dependent  on the rate with which new material is being pro-
            duced and available. User interaction with  the  tools  sup-
            plied  is fully structure oriented whenever applicable, i.e.
            most input is by means of structural formulas to be drawn on
            the  screen and output is structure oriented where appropri-
            ate.

            It is the Center's policy to provide users with all documen-
            tation that is available with a program or data base, and to
            complement this information with on-line  Help,  with  extra
            manual and "introductions" where necessary and with document
            files  in  a  central  document  directory  from  which  all
            material can be down loaded.

            Access to the Center is possible in many different ways. The
            route  to be chosen will depend on a user's local situation.
            Many routes connect to the Center's terminal  servers  which
            will distribute incoming calls over the available resources.

            CancerNet is a quick and easy way to obtain,  through  elec-
            tronic   mail,   information   from   the   National  Cancer
            Institute's Physician Data Query (PDQ) database.   CancerNet
            also  has information about PDQ, PDQ distributors, and other
            products and services  of  the  NCI,  including  a  list  of
            patient  publications  available  from  the Office of Cancer
            Communications.

            CancerNet includes state-of-the-art summaries on  prognosis,
            staging,  histology, and treatment of more than 75 types and
            sites of cancer.  For each cancer diagnosis, there  are  two
            different  statements  available, a technical summary geared
            to the needs of the health care professional, which includes
            references  to  published literature; and a patient informa-
            tion  statement  which  is  written  in   easy-to-understand
            language.   Screening  guidelines and supportive care state-
            ments on the management of side effects of  cancer  and  its
            treatment  are  also  available.  The information is updated
            monthly. CancerNet is a trademark  of  the  National  Cancer
            Institute.
