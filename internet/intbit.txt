INTRODUCTION
 
 
Over twenty years ago the Department of Defense established an
electronic network for researchers known as ARPANET.  Today, a
loose collection of networks, the Internet, provides high-speed
electronic links for scientists, researchers, and other
information workers in education, government, and business.
 
Some of these networks focus on a research topic or an academic
discipline; others serve regional groups of institutions. The
oldest educational network is BITNET (Because It's Time
Network), which specializes in "store and forward" message and
file transmission. Internet provides direct access to remote
computer sites along with message and file transfer.
 
The federally subsidized NSFnet serves as the backbone for
network interconnectivity in the United States linking CREN
(BITNET and CSnet), the Internet, and other noncommercial
academic and research networks together for electronic mail,
file transfer, news and other services. Over 1,000,000 computer
sites form the "backfence" over which neighbors in this
electronic global village exchange data and gossip.
 
The Internet is just the foot-path of the Information Highway --
leading the way in linking information providers and users
around the globe. Although the network has experienced
phenomenal growth in the past few years, the services and
navigation tools available on the net are still in their
infancy. Learning to use the Internet for research, business or
pleasure takes a considerable investment of time and energy.
 
The most popular uses of Internet/Bitnet are sending and
receiving electronic mail, participating in special interest
groups, reading and writing for electronic digests and journals,
searching online library catalogs around the world, and
acquiring text and program files from remote computers. The
increased availability of multi-media resources in the last year
or so has made the network a richer and more comfortable place.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VAX SYSTEM COMMANDS
 
 
Although much of this guide applies to any Internet connection,
the guide was written with VMS users in mind. If VAX-speak is
not your thing, skip the next few sections.
 
Logging on the system
 
Contact your local computer center to set up an account and
learn the location of local terminals or telephone numbers for
remote access.  If your campus computer system is set up for
dial-up access, you can use a computer from your home or office
to connect to the system.  Your account will include two
identifying codes: username and password.  The username is your
local system e-mail mailbox and will be a part of your Internet
or BITNET address.

VAX Internet Shortcuts with LOGIN.COM
 
 
If you use a VAX to connect to the internet, you might want to
create a login.com file to make life a little easier. This plain
ASCII file can be created with any editor. Note: Lines beginning
with ! are comments and don't have to be typed but are included
here for clarity. Type @login to start the program after any
changes; otherwise the program will run when you logon to the
VAX.

E-MAIL
 
 
One of the most useful facilities on Internet is the ability to
send messages to network users in the next town or across the
globe rapidly and without transmission errors. To send e-mail
you need to know the recipient's username and Internet or Bitnet
system address.  Computer network addresses are a bit like
telephone numbers, in some instances an extension will be
sufficient, but in others you need area codes and even country
codes.
 
Local network   username                   noonan
 
Remote user     username@internet_address  noonan@msus1.msus.edu
 
In the United States, most Internet domains end with
designations indicating the type of site or geographical
location:
 
  edu  educational institution     mil   military site
  com  commercial organization     net   network center
  gov  government agency           org   all other organizations
  us   in the United States        mn.us in Minnesota
 
Outside the United States most network addresses end with a
country code. The meaning of many of these country codes is
obvious, such as UK for United Kingdom or AU for Australia.
Others are less obvious -- because there can only be one region
with the AU code, Austria is identified as AT.
 
Mail is sent to a network address that contains the username and
network location of the recipient. Local mail requires only the
correct username. To send local mail, type MAIL. Type  SEND,
then the recipient's username, subject, and message. Use the
following format to send  network mail:
in%"username@network_address."
 
    Local Mail    MAIL>  Send
                  To: noonan
                  Subject: Just testing
 
    Network mail  MAIL>   Send
                  To: in%"noonan@msus1.msus.edu"
                  Subject: Just testing again
 
Messages can be as long as needed, but remember that every
network user has a limited amount of space available in his or
her account.  The VAX editor is hard to use effectively with a
microcomputer.  Long messages can be written on a word
processor, saved as an ASCII file, and uploaded to the VAX via
Kermit.  Short messages can be composed on the fly, but remember
to use the left arrow key instead of the backspace key to erase
text. Do not send messages in all capital letters; they are too
hard to read and have the impact of shouting at the recipient.
 
Messages are placed in folders(directories) depending on their
status. New messages are placed in the NEWMAIL folder until you
have read them, then they can be found in the MAIL folder.
Messages you delete will be placed in the WASTEBASKET folder
until you EXIT the MAIL utility using the CTRL-Z command.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How To Find E-mail Addresses
 
Netfind Servers
 
Although some network directories exist, it may be necessary to
ask people for their e-mail addresses. One of the easiest to use
and most comprehensive network address directories is the
University of Colorado's Netfind Server. Given a bit of basic
information, such as last name and institutional affiliation,
the server will search for that person's e-mail address. In some
cases it will be able to retrieve not only the correct network
address, but also a mailing address and telephone number. Be
sure to read the help file when you logon for a more complete
description of how the program works. Select a nearby server and
logon as netfind.
 
  archie.au                AARNet, Melbourne, Australia
  bruno.cs.colorado.edu    University of Colorado, Boulder
  dino.conicit.ve          NCTSR, Venezuela
  ds.internic.net          InterNIC
  lincoln.technet.sg       Technet, Singapore
  malloco.ing.puc.cl       Catholic Univ. of Chile, Santiago
  monolith.cc.ic.ac.uk     Imperial College, London, England
  netfind.ee.mcgill.ca     McGill University, Montreal, Canada
  nic.uakom.sk             Academy of Sciences, lovakia
  redmont.cis.uab.edu      University of Alabama, Birmingham
 
 
InterNIC Registration Services Center:
 
For registered domains and network information centers, InterNic
offers a useful alternative to Netfind. Some local sites offer a
very easy to use local Whois server linked to InterNIC. Type
whois minneapolis to see if your site has a server installed;
otherwise try:
 
            Whois Server
            Telnet rs.internic.net or 198.41.0.5
            Logon:  type whois and follow directions
            Logoff: type Q
 
 
Finger
 
Although it sounds a bit rude, lots of folks finger other
network users each day. If your site offers finger service, you
can easily find the correct addresses for local accounts by
typing:  finger so-and-so.
To finger a remote account, type: finger so-and-so@remote_site.
Finger has the ability to display user-generated plan files and
this feature has led to a variety of useful and even
entertaining network services. To get current information about
updates to this guide or Network News, type finger
noonan@msus1.msus.edu.
 
Finger is also available via telnet:  telnet site/port=79 and
when the connection is established type username. For example,
telnet msus1.msus.edu/port=79 and type noonan.
 
 
Other Sources of E-mail Addresses
 
If you are looking for an address at a specific academic
institution, check the campus gopher to see if it has an address
server. If you think that an individual may subscribe to a
specific special interest list, use the listserv command "review
listname" to obtain a list of subscribers. As a last resort, you
may want to write the postmaster at the location for
information, but keep in mind that they are very busy people and
may not have time to respond.
 
 
Addressing Internet Mail
 
 
Most VAX systems require mail addresses typed in one of the
following formats:  in%"user@site"  or    smtp%"user@site"
 
Although some Internet sites are also Bitnet sites, many are
not. Use the address format listed under Bitnet below to send
mail to a Bitnet site from an Internet only site. Note: Some
savvy system administrators take care of details like this for
their users.
 
Local user       username
Remote user      username@internet_address
 
Internet         user@site
Bitnet           user%site.bitnet@gateway
                 ex. noonan%msus1.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu
 
America Online   user@aol.com
Applelink        user@applelink.apple.com
ATTmail          user@attmail.com
Compuserve       71234.567@compuserve.com
Easynet          user@host.enet.dec.com or
                 user%host.enet@decwrl.dec.com
Genie            user@genie.geis.com
MCI              user@mcimail.com
Prodigy          user@prodigy.com
 
 
Managing E-mail Glut
 
 
1.  Use the delete key often and with glee. Nobody ever said you
    have to read every message you receive, any more than you
    have to read every flyer and piece of junk mail that comes to
    your office or home. Don't hesitate to delete mail on the
    basis of the subject, source, or first few lines.
 
2.  If you file mail you want to look at later in appropriate
    file folders, you will be more organized or at least enjoy
    the illusion of being organized.
 
3.  When you sign up for a list, you will receive a welcome
    message outlining some of the functions of the list and how
    to get off the list. File these messages in a folder called
    lists so that you can retrieve them later.
 
4.  Get the *.MAI file clutter out of the root directory so you
    will be able to find the files you need to use. To create a
    MAIL directory (from within Mail), type set mail_dir [.mail].
 
5.  Try the following handy trick to edit and extract files in
    one easy step. If a long message has a paragraph or two you
    want to save for later use, type read/edit message #. Delete
    everything except the paragraphs you want to save; hit CTRL-Z;
    type write filename.txt; type quit.

MAILING LISTS
 
 
Hundreds of special interest groups or mailing lists are open to
subscription on Internet. Most are free and open to anyone
interested in the topic under consideration.  Some lists have
little message traffic on them; others are so active your
mailbox will be quickly filled with messages.
 
Lists seem to take on the characteristics of the folks who use
them. Most are serious and mannerly, but some revel in humor,
controversy, or sheer pedantry (most list users are academics).
The anonymity of e-mail has given rise to a peculiar form of
behavior known as flaming.  Flaming occurs when normally polite
individuals use e-mail to insult other list members, groups of
individuals, or whole nations.  Some "flames" are unintentional
and  reflect ignorance or inexperience; others are simply nasty,
racist, or bigoted diatribes.
 
 
Finding a List
 
To participate in the mailing list world you first need to find
an interesting list in this guide or on the List of Lists (see
bibliography). The easiest way to find a list of interest to you
is to send the following message:
 
     Mail to:   in%"listserv@bitnic.bitnet" or
                in%"listserv%bitnic.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu"
     Message:   list global /topic
     Example:   list global /Africa
 
You can also search the mailing list database at
INTGROUP@NDSUVM1 for topics of interest.
 
 
The Listserv Manager
 
Each mailing list is based at a specific network node or
listserv address that runs a program called the Mailing Lists
Manager.  The program functions as archivist, file server, and
mailing list distributor. All of the little nit-picky details
related to the management of a list are taken care of by the
listserv software. Send requests for action to listserv@site not
to the list itself. The following example shows messages that
could be sent to: listserv@uhupvm1.uh.edu related to the PACS-L.
 
Message                         Action Requested / Example
 
subscribe listname your name    subscribe to a list
                                sub pacs-l Melvyl Dewey

                                unsub pacs-l
 
index listname                  get list of files in archive
                                index pacs-l
get filename                    request copy of a file

                                set pacs-l mail
 
 
 
 
Searching a List Archive
 
Usually all list messages are maintained in archive form at the
mailing list site.  While it is possible to obtain the entire
contents of these archives by sending the appropriate "get
filename" command, this can result in receiving great quantities
of information that may be dated or simply of little interest.
By sending a simple e-mail message you can search the archives
of a mailing list for material related to a specific topic.
 
 
Initial search:  mail to:  listserv@location
                 message   // JOB Echo=No
                           Database Search DD=Rules
                           //Rules DD *
                           Search search-term in listname
                           Index
                           /*
 
Next request:    mail to:  listserv@location
                 message   // JOB Echo=No
                           Database Search DD=Rules
                           //Rules DD *
                           Search search-term in listname
                           (Note: Repeat initial search)
                           Print message-number(s)
                           /*
 
 
Managing Your Lists
 
1.  Keep track of your subscriptions so that you can modify or
    cancel them as needed. Keep the welcome message you receive
    when you subscribe to a list.
 
2.  Switch to digest format if the flood of messages is too much
    to deal with on a daily basis. Note: The additional steps
    required to retrieve specific messages may not be worth the
    trouble. It is just as easy for many people to delete
    messages on the basic of the subject header.
 
3.  Use a Usenet reader to read lists that are mirrored (gated)
    to Usenet newsgroups. Using Usenet frees up precious mailbox
    space and lets you still participate fully in list activities.
    If you just want to read the messages in a newsgroup, you could
    also use gopher or www to read the messages.
 
4.  Search list archives for researching topics of interest to
    you. Many list archives are open to non-members so you can
    search without being engulfed in a flood of messages.
 
5.  Stop lurking and become an active participant in the lists
    you read. Use them for research, trial balloons, and good
    conversation.

ELECTRONIC JOURNALS AND NEWSLETTERS
 
 
Electronic digests and journals are also available from some
listserv sites. A few are refereed; most are not. Some are
sponsored by professional associations or commercial publishers,
but a great many are the online equivalent of desktop or copy-
shop self-publishing efforts. One unusual characteristic of
electronic journals is that they often contain only brief
abstracts of articles that can be requested from the listserv
address.
 
 
Major archive sites
 
A couple of years ago CICnet mounted a major effort to collect,
organize, and archive electronic journals. Although the project
has suffered from changing management, lack of funding, and poor
subject cataloging, it is the most important collection of
electronic journals on the net. Because of an emphasis on
collecting journals from other archive sites rather than from
lists and Usenet newsgroups, there is a lot of older material in
the collection including a number of journals that ceased
publication some time ago.

Commercial publishers looked at the number of potential readers
on the net and tried to figure out how to tap the market. One
effort is the Electronic Newstand that provides sample articles,
tables-of-contents, and "special" subscription offers. Aside
from the fact that most of the "special" subscription offers
don't match the offers found in flyers on every campus in the
United States or in the magazines themselves, the Electronic
Newstand is a smashing idea for both publisher and the net.

The Chronicle of Higher Education is the favorite publication of
many academics. The Chronicle gopher server offers summary of
each issue and a searchable database of job listings.

Almanac
 
Like listservs, Almanac provides subscriptions to newsletters
and journals, as well as easy retrieval of specific articles.
Almanac servers can also include multimedia graphics and sound
bytes in e-mail files. Although some servers accept document
submissions, Almanac does not provide the platform for
discussion of common issues and concerns offered by the special
interest lists. Almanac servers offer timely and free
information to e-mail users, particularly in the areas related
to agricultural extension services.

REMOTE CONNECTIONS
 
 
TELNET
 
The telnet command lets you connect to other computer systems on
the Internet. Most hosts use some sort of login procedure
requiring user-ids and passwords. Activities on remote system
are limited to those available to the guests.
 
One of the frustrations of making telnet connections is that
from time to time it is nearly impossible to break the
connection. The Vax LOGIN.COM file on page 4 of this guide show
how to remap the keyboard to use the escape sequence listed
below.
 
 
Telnet Commands
 
TELNET host             Connect to a remote host
 
TELNET/esca=^C host     Sets escape sequence so that Ctrl-C
                        followed by q exits any telnet
                        connection
 
TELNET host/port=#      Some host require specific port number
 
TELNET/TN3270 host      Connect to a remote using IBM 3270

Capturing a Telnet Session
 
In spite of the popularity of Gopher, WWW, and Hytelnet for
making easy telnet connections, they are not particularly useful
when you need to capture session activities to a file for later
editing. If you want to log a session to a file that you can
subsequently edit and use in other ways, use the telnet log-file
option. This works well on systems that do not use specific
screen locations for directions and commands. For example,
logging a search of the PALS catalog works well while a similar
log for a LUMINA search is unusable. (PALS and LUMINA are the
online catalogs of the Minnesota State University System and the
University of Minnesota.)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP)
 
Anonymous FTP (File Transfer Protocol) transfers files from one
Internet site to another. For the most part, remote file
transfers should be used only after business hours and on
weekends so that remote system resources are free to serve local
users. The basic procedure for using FTP is:
 
    Basic Commands                    FTP Example
 
    FTP site                          FTP vm1.nodak.edu
    Type user anonymous               Type user anonymous
    Type your full e-mail address     Type your full e-mail address
    CD subdirectory                   CD NNEWS
    Get  filename                     Get guide2.nnews
    Type exit to end ftp session      Type exit
 
FTP Commands
 
DIR       List files on remote host               dir
CD        Change subdirectory on remote host      cd directory-name
          Move up one level                       cd ..
 
GET       Transfer a file from remote host        get filename
MGET      Transfer a group of files               mget *.txt
PUT       Transfer a file to remote host          put filename
MPUT      Transfer a group of files remote host   mget *.txt
SET TYPE  Required for transferring binary files  type image
 
SPAWN     Run another process(program)
                                            spawn type readme /page
          Useful for looking at READ.ME files
          without quitting FTP
 
 
Finding Files Using ARCHIE
 
The ARCHIE servers around the world maintain a searchable
database of the contents of hundreds of FTP site archives. If
you are looking for specific file or type of files, ARCHIE will
help you locate appropriate FTP sites. If your site has an
Archie client, just type the following command to get the list
of basic commands available to you: archie. To find sites that
have subdirectories of picture files, type archie pictures.
 
Public access Archie servers are available for sites lacking
Archie clients. These servers often limit the number of
concurrent telnet connections due to overwhelming demand. Ask
your computer services department to install an Archie client.
 
                      Telnet archie.internic.net
                      Login type archie
                      Type find search_term
                      Type quit
 
 
Transferring Files to a PC
 
Some remote computers maintain archives of public domain and
shareware programs for IBM and Macintosh microcomputers.
Although copying files from remote computers to a Vax using FTP
usually takes very little time, using Kermit to download files
from a Vax to a microcomputer is a tedious process. If a program
is available on a local BBS, there is no reason to waste your
time using FTP and Kermit to download files.

Online Catalog Basics
 
 
Keyword and Boolean Searching
 
The online catalog supports a variety of ways of searching for
information not available in the traditional card catalog. One
of the most useful is the keyword or term search. Select the
keyword search option and enter the term or terms you think are
most clearly related to the subject of your search. Keyword
searches are a good starting point when you are not familiar
with the subject headings in a particular subject area. Note:
Keyword searches may be restricted to just one part of a catalog
record such as the title or they may be based on the entire
record.
 
Boolean searches combine terms using the logical operators AND,
OR, and NOT. The OR operator expands the number of possible
matches or "hits"; AND and NOT limit the number of matches to
those items most closely related to the search topic.
 
Wildcards or truncators expand the number of successful matches
in a search. For example, some online systems will search for
any record that includes the root word GEO or GEO#. Such a
search would find geometry, geology, geographical, etc.
 
Some online catalogs allow users to limit a search to a
particular library, language, materials format, or date of
publication. Often these limits are set after the initial search
is completed. Search delimiters can bring the number of "hits"
down to manageable size.
 
 
Databases and Gateways
 
Many online catalogs now offer access to periodical databases,
dictionaries,  in-house bibliographies, calendars, and other
databases. Because of licensing agreements these additional
features may not be available to remote users on the Internet.
Read the catalog news or help screens from time to time to check
for new resources.
 
Search Strategies
 
1.  Identify the best set of online catalogs to search for
    your topic. Local catalogs offer convenience and ready
    access; national library or major university catalogs
    collection depth or breadth. Authors and topics closely tied
    to a specific region are usually well represented in the
    library catalogs of those regions.
 
2.  Determine the type(s) of search to conduct: author, title,
    subject heading, keyword, or call number. Keyword searches
    are a good starting point when you don't know which subject
    headings are related to your topic.
 
3.  Jot down the search terms you will use to complete the
    search. Modify the list as needed after viewing citations.
 
    Note: Most online systems balk at searching for short common
    words such as THE, IN, or WITH. Avoid using these terms.
 
4.  To expand the number of "hits" use the logical operator or
    and use the appropriate wildard or truncator.
 
    For example: search for "Twain or Melville" to expand the
    search to items that mention either or both authors.
 
5.  To limit the number of hits use the logical operators AND
    and NOT.
 
    For example: search for "Iowa and Wisconsin" to limit
    retrieval to items that include both keywords.
 
6.  Some online catalogs, such as PALS, allow users to employ
    a multi-step process to limit and refine searches. Once the
    primary search request is processed, you can limit it by
    date, language, and even material format.
 
7.  Display a few records to see if you are finding the right
    sort of material. Examine the subject headings and consider
    changing your search terms if necessary. Continue the search
    until you are satisfied that you have found enough material
    to serve your needs.
 
8.  Record the results of your search. Print a hard copy of
    the screen or capture the whole search to a text file for
    later editing and printing, or just jot down the information
    you need in order to locate the material in a local library.
 
9.  Consider repeating your search in another online catalog.
 
10. After you complete an online search, the best place to
    begin your search for the materials is your local college or
    central public library. Although you may not find the exact
    title you want on the shelves, you may find similar and
    perhaps even more useful items on nearby shelves. Your local
    public or college librarian can help you complete an
    interlibrary loan request if necessary.

EXPLORING THE NETS -- TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
 
 
The sheer quantity and variety of information available on the
Internet can overwhelm both newcomers and seasoned network
explorers. As new links are connected, new databases
established, and new uses found for the network resources, the
task of finding what you need or want becomes more complex.
Navigating the networks in search of useful material can be
either a frustrating or exhilarating task, but several
innovative mechanisms exist to help deal with the Internet
version of information overload.
 
Gopher
 
Gopher is a distributed document delivery service using a
client-server model to make it easy for users to search for and
retrieve materials from remote sites. Gopher employs a
hierarchical outline to make browsing and searching local and
remote sources of information quick and uncomplicated. Once
connected to a Gopher server you can connect to other
information servers without being bothered by most of the
details of Telnet or FTP protocols and addresses. Gopher
software is available via anonymous FTP from
boombox.micro.umn.edu.
 
The Gopher Advantage
 
1. Connect to other services: bulletin boards, library catalogs,
   and other gophers around the world.
2. Search databases, file archives, gopher menus, online
   directories and phone books.
3. Retrieve, view, mail or save documents and files.
4. Tranfer text and binary files.
 
 
The Main Gopher Menu
 
One of the best gopher servers is run by the Library of
Congress. Each menu item on the main menu leads to other menus,
some of which lead to yet other menus. Some sub-menus items
offer text files for viewing or saving; others connect to
bulletin boards or library catalogs.
 
 
 
                    Library of Congress Marvel

  2.  Library of Congress: Facilities, Activities, and Services/
  3.  Research and Reference/

  5.  The U.S. Congress/
  6.  Federal Government Information/

  9.  Employee Information/
  10. The Global Electronic Library (by Subject)/
  11. Internet Resources/
  12. What's New on LC MARVEL/
  13. Search LC MARVEL Menus/
 
 
As with most well-organized gophers, Marvel lists items on the
main menu in the order of importance to the mission of the
organization rather than in alphabetical order. General purpose
search tools are listed last. Gopher servers are public faces
that organizations present to the world and require as much
thought and attention as organizations give to other public
information services.
 
Connecting to Gopher
 
If you have an Internet account at an organization that has
installed a gopher client, just type "gopher." Otherwise you can
connect to the gopher at the University of Minnesota:
 
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA GOPHER          Local dialup (612) 626-2400
Telnet: consultant.micro.umn.edu        Access> Type consultant.micro.umn.edu
Logon:  Type gopher                     Logon:  Type gopher
        Terminal: VT100                         Terminal: VT100
Logoff: Type Q                          Logoff: Type Q then type EXIT
 
 
If the University of Minnesota server is busy or just to see
other ways to organize Gopher servers, try one of the following:
 
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS            UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA CRUZ
Gopher marvel.loc.gov 70 or    Gopher gopher.ucsc.edu 70 or
Telnet marvel.loc.gov          Telnet infoslug.ucsc.edu
Logon: type marvel             Logon: type infoslug
 
 
Searching Gopherspace with Veronica
 
Although it is fairly easy to move from menu to menu on one or
more Gophers, the hierarchical menu system isn't much help when
you want to find a topic on another Gopher server quickly. The
Veronica program collects menu entries from hundreds of Gophers
into a searchable database. Veronica searches can be simple
keyword or complex Boolean searches. The results of a Veronica
search are presented in the familiar gopher menu format.
 
Veronica searches:
 
Searches may use simple keywords:     weather
 
Use Boolean operators:                weather and minnesota
                                      weather not minnesota
 
Use Wildcards:                        librar*
                                      librar* and copyright
 
Veronica searches are limited to retrieving a maximum of 200
hits unless the following command is added to the search:    m-
It is important to remember that the Veronica database is based
on menu titles that were not necessarily  created by librarians
or indexers. Many of the items are collected from sub-menus and
the titles aren't particularly informative.
 
The Veronica servers are heavily used and may not be available
just when you need them,  that's why there are usually several
different servers available at a given time.
 
 
Bookmarks: Designing your own Gopher menu
 
Gopher clients allow users to create their own Gopher bookmark
menu by moving to a menu item and hitting the "a" key. The item
will be added to a list of bookmarks that can be viewed at any
time by hitting the "v" key. Bookmarks enable one to skip going
from menu to menu to menu to reach the exact item one wants to
view.
 
Bookmark example:
 
                           Bookmarks
 
   1.    Search Gopher Titles at the University of Minnesota <?>
   2.    Search gopherspace at University of Cologne <?>
   3.    Search Gopherspace using Veronica/
   4.    All the Gopher Servers in the World/
   5.    InterNIC: Internet Network Information Center/
   6.    Library of Congress Marvel Gopher/
   7.    United States Government Gophers/
   8.    Electronic Journal collection from CICnet/
   9.    Hytelnet library catalogs (word search) <?>
   10.   List of Lists <?>
   11.   RTFM - rtfm.mit.edu anon ftp archive of FAQs/
 
 
 
This example emphasizes tools and menus that make it easy to
navigate gopher-space. The duplication of Veronica/Jughead
servers was to make sure that a working server could be reached
when needed.
 
Gopher bookmarks are stored in a file named: gopherrc. on VAX
systems. It is a good idea to back-up favorite gopher bookmarks
by typing: copy gopherrc. mygopher.txt.  Note: Don't do this
while your gopher client is running.
 
If your list of bookmarks gets corrupted, you can restore the
list by typing: copy mygopher.txt gopherrc.
 
This technique can also be used to create and use a series of
bookmark lists on VMS and perhaps other systems. Gopher and
Internet demonstrations can be customized for specific audience
by using a set of bookmarks related to the interests of that
audience.
 
Bookmarks are not available when you use telnet instead of a
gopher client.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
WWW -- World Wide Web
 
Like Gopher, World Wide Web is a distributed document delivery
service using a client-server model to make it easy for users to
search for and retrieve materials from remote sites. WWW uses
hypertext to make browsing and searching local and remote
sources of information quick and uncomplicated. Once connected
to a WWW server you can connect to other information servers
without being bothered by most of the details of Telnet or FTP
protocols and addresses. WWW browsers, as the clients are
called, are available for many platforms.
 
Unlike Gopher, WWW integrates text, graphics, and sound as well
as links to other  resources on its pages. If Gopher menus
resemble a collapsed outline, WWW pages contain the text that
brings the outline to life. Web servers use a hypertext mark-up
language (HTML) to produce visually appealing and easy to follow
pages.
 
(Graphic mage of Brunel University's Web goes here.)
 
In the example above, Brunel University's Information Service
provides links to other pages and services (underlined items) in
an easy to read format. The Web advantage is the ability to
flesh out a simple outline of resources with text and multimedia
as well as embedded links to other resources.
 
Uniform Resource Locators
 
World Wide Web has led the way in the use of standardized
identification of network resources by integrating URLs into Web
pages. Uniform Resource Locators identify the type and location

Connecting to the Web
 
The best way to connect to the WWW is with your own browser;
check to see if your site has one installed. The LYNX browser
for VT100 sites is available via anonymous FTP from
ftp2.cc.ukans.edu in the pub/lynx directory.
 
If you don't have a browser, try one of the following services
to find out how the Web works.

WAIS -- Wide Area Information Server
 
WAIS is another distributed document delivery service using a
client-server model. Like Gopher and World Wide Web it makes it
easier for users to find, search, and retrieve documents from
remote sites. It is widely used by both gopher and WWW servers
to provide searchable indexes to document collections and
databases.
 
WAIS (Wide Area Information Server) helps users search multiple
Internet sites at one time. Over 500 databases are searchable
from the WAIS operated by Thinking Machines (the source of the
original software). WAIS searches are fast and the results can
be scanned online or mailed to your network address. There is a
limit to the number of "hits" that WAIS reports, but each is
assigned a relevancy score that can be useful in choosing which
sources to examine. Note that not all WAIS databases are really
comprehensive, many are still experimental and incomplete. While
WAIS is easy to use, read the help file.

             Telnet  quake.think.com or 192.31.181.1
             Logon:  type wais
 
CNIDR's freeWAIS provides a significant improvement to the
original software by supporting both wildcard and Boolean
searches that were lacking in the original software.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gateway Programs
 
There are programs that serve as gateways to internet resources
that can be reached by logging into a remote computer via the
TELNET protocol. Most of these began as attempts to make the
connection to remote library systems easier for local users. As
a more varied group of network resources became available, these
gateway programs grew to include access to bulletin boards,
databases of all sorts, online games (for example, GO and
Chess), and more.
 
Two of the most useful gateway programs are: HYTELNET produced
by Peter Scott and Earl Fogel at the University of Saskatchewan
and LIBS.COM by Mark Resner at Sonoma State University. While
these programs can be run from individual accounts, it makes
more sense to make these programs available to all users on a
system. These programs are available for both Unix and VMS
systems.
 
 
Both programs are made available to remote users for
demonstration via the connections below. If you intend to use
these programs regularly, obtain copies of them for your own
account or encourage your computer center gurus to make them
available on your local system.
 
HYTELNET                           Available via anonymous FTP from
TELNET  access.usask.ca or         ftp.access.usask.ca in the
TELNET  128.233.3.1                pub/hytelnet directory
LOGON:  Login: type hytelnet
LOGOFF: Type q
Note: Automatic remote connection is not available with the demo account
 
LIBS.COM                           Available via anonymous FTP from
TELNET  vax.sonoma.edu or          sonoma.edu in the pub directory
TELNET  130.157.2.3
LOGON:  Username: type OPAC
LOGOFF: Select Exit from main menu
 
Updates to the HYTELNET program are posted regularly on the
moderated HYTEL-L list. Subscribe to the list by sending request
to listserv@kentvm.bitnet. This list is probably the best way to
keep current on new TELNET services available on the Internet
even if you don't use the software.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
INTERNET BULLETIN BOARDS
 
 
Many BBS systems exist on the Internet and are accessible via
Telnet. They vary greatly in functionality and amount of usage.
Please keep in mind that BBSs go up and down quite often so this
list may be soon obsolete. The following list includes some of
the best Internet BBSs.
 
 
Campus-Wide Information Systems
 
Most campus-wide information systems (CWIS) serve the needs of
the local campus community, but a few offer valuable services
that may interest a wider audience. Many of these services can
be reached via Gopher, Libs.Com, or Hytelnet.

SHOPPING ON THE NET
 
 
The Mall of America has nothing to fear from the net -- yet! As
multimedia interfaces to the net improve, it is likely that
shopping opportunities will increase. Network users should avoid
sending credit card information via e-mail and use the phone or
postal service for placing orders or establishing accounts.
 
The best guide to shopping on the net is Dave Taylor's "The
Internet Mall: Shopping on the Information Highway." Finger
taylor@netcom.com for information on how to obtain this list.
 
Here are a few of the bookstores that maintain a presence on the

USENET NEWSGROUPS
 
One of the most controversial aspects of the net is access to
Usenet newsgroups. Of the thousands of newsgroups there are a
handful (okay a big handful) of groups that border on the
obscene. Many more are simply distasteful. Because of this
newsgroups are often censored on University campuses by
restricting access to specific groups or whole categories of
groups. In the United States during television rating "sweep's
week" tawdry Usenet groups vie with porno bulletin boards as
titillating "news" on local stations. They are not "news" nor do
they reflect what is happening on the net or BBSs.
 
Newsgroups can be important sources of up-to-date information
and wonderful rumors. Since most groups allow the free flow of
messages, the number of rantings, flames, and pet peeves runs
high. Anyone who has read any newsgroup for a while has seen the
"Make Money Fast" chainletter scam, warnings of approaching
doom, and other way-off-topic messages.
 
One nice feature of Usenet newsgroups is that you can subscribe
to a group without filling up your mailbox. The reader gives you
access to a centrally stored set of messages that usually keeps
a few days or a few hundred messages for each newsgroup.
 
Usenet News requires use of a mail reader that is different from
the mail program that is used for e-mail and listserv messages.
The biggest challenge confronting a new user is figuring out how
the reader works and selecting newsgroups to read regularly. The
easiest thing to do is to deselect all newsgroups and then add a
few at a time when you have the leisure to find them. Check with
your local computer center for how to obtain access to Usenet.
 
For lurkers only: if you just want to read a few newsgroups,
check to see if you can access them from your local gopher. Even
if your local gopher doesn't offer Usenet News, you can do a
Veronica search to locate other sites that do. Note: Not all
sites allow off-campus or 24 hour access.
 
 
Get the FAQs
 
Even if you don't have direct access to Usenet, you might find
the collection FAQs in the news.answers archive of interest. The
FAQs or Frequently Asked Questions files are updated regularly
and cover a wide range of topics. They are useful pointers to
not only electronic resources but also a fairly reliable source
of answers that have been tested by real users.
 
Start by getting a copy of the ftplist and the usenet-faq or
primer via anonymous FTP.
 
                    FTP rtfm.mit.edu or ftp 18.70.0.226
                    Type login anonymous
                    Type your e-mail address or guest
                    Type cd pub/usenet/news.answers
 
FAQs are also available via e-mail. Send an e-mail message with
the words "help" and "index" on separate lines to mail-
server@rtfm.mit.edu to get the necessary details. Many FAQs are
also available via a Veronica search of gopher space.
Unfortunately, some gopher maintainers don't update their
collection of FAQs on a regular basis.
 
A recent sampling of new and updated FAQs found:
 
                        A Biologist's Guide to Internet
Resources
                        FAQ: Audio File Formats

Note: Many of the FAQs are rather lengthy files, so be sure that
you have the space for them on your local account.
 
 
Netnews Filtering Server
 
One of the most intriguing and potentially useful services on
the Internet is Stanford's Netnews Filtering Server that links
Usenet news articles, Wais full-text indexing, and listserv-type
delivery. The service responds to user selected profiles that
include search term(s), threshold scores, and length of
subscription. Depending on the profile, the service will send a
single message containing a batch of Usenet articles related to
the topic either daily or weekly. The news articles contain only
the first 15 lines of text, just enough to decide whether or not
a particular article is worth retrieving from the service. The
service only indexes and retrieves the most recent Usenet
articles.
 
The service uses the original Wais software which does not
support Boolean or wildcard searches. The default threshold
score is set at 60 which may be too low to filter-out off-topic
material. Search terms must be chosen with care in order to
exclude off-topic material. For example, searches for the
library would retrieve items about program libraries as well as
traditional libraries.
 
To obtain a copy of the documentation send the following message
to netnews@db.stanford.edu: help. To try the service send the
following message to the same address: search online service.
Within minutes you will receive a summary of the day's Usenet
messages related to the topic. Full-text of specific articles
can be retrieved by sending a message to the same address: get
article such-and-such.
 
For folks without easy access to Usenet newsgroups, Stanford's
Netnews Filtering Server offers a convenient way to read news
articles related to their own specific interests. For
researchers, the service offers a chance to try a type of
selective dissemination of information that may be as essential
in the future as access to online library catalogs and
databases.

It seems that every couple of weeks a new service is announced
with the stated purpose of tracking Internet resources. Some
specialize while others try to cover everything. All present
grand opportunities for forward-itis, a well-known disease of
special interest lists. If you want to keep-up without being
overwhelmed, subscribe to the following lists.
 
For regular updates about new Internet services and online
catalogs, subscribe to HYTEL-L. This list distributes updates
and new additions to Peter Scott's Hytelnet system. It is the
best single source for information about new telnet connections
on the Internet. Send your subscription to
listserv@kentvm.bitnet.
 
For just about everything else, subscribe to Net-Happenings -
Gleason Sackman's gleanings from a variety of lists and
information services. Send your subscription requests to
listserv@is.internic.net.
 
 
The Top Ten List for Internet Novices
 
Following the David Letterman tradition, here is a list of the
top ten things to do once connected to the Internet.
 
10. Browse one of the online bookstores for new Internet books.
    A new one is issued every ten minutes.
 
9.  If you live in the north country, be thankful for ice and
    snow and that you don't live in an earthquake zone. Finger
    quake@geophys.washington.edu.
 
8.  Vax users: create a LOGIN.COM file to make life easier and
    set mail_dir [.mail].
 
7.  Send mail to a friend. If really desperate, send mail to
    yourself or the White House. Don't expect a prompt, personal
    response from president@whitehouse.gov.
 
6.  Try the Infoslug Gopher. Telnet to infoslug.ucsc.edu and
    login as infoslug. If you have a gopher client, use it to
    connect to gopher.ucsc.edu 70. Set a bookmark or two if
    using a gopher client.
 
5.  Get lost in the "web." Telnet to ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu and
    login as www. Use the Go command to visit the library of the
    University of Texas. The URL is
    http://www.library.utexas.edu/. If you have a Mosaic or
    Cello browser, the library has some great online exhibits.
 
4.  Sample Usenet newsgroup messages via the Netnews Filtering
    Server. Send the following message to
    netnews@db.stanford.edu: search online services or a topic
    of your own choosing. Perhaps you ought to send a message
    with just the word "help" first to get a guide to using the
    service.
 
3.  Search the global List of Lists for your favorite topic.
    Send the following message to listserv@bitnic.bitnet: list
    global/my_favorite_topic.
 
2.  Check out public library services on the net. Gopher or
    telnet to library.cpl.org.
 
1.  Subscribe to the newsletter that updates this guide. Send
    the following message to listserv@vm1.nodak.edu: sub nnews
    your name.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GLOSSARY
 
 
ADDRESS: An assigned number that identifies a host in an
internet. It has two or three parts: network number, optional

ARCHIE: A tool used to search hundreds of file archives on the
Internet.
 
BROWSER: A client for World Wide Web.
 
CLIENT/SERVER: Software that can operate on multi-platforms or
multiple machines. For example, Gopher servers and clients can
run on VAX, UNIX, MAC or DOS machines and take advantage of the
special characteristics of each platform. MAC users connected to
a UNIX gopher server would have a GUI (graphical user interface
-- complete with icons and folders), while UNIX clients
connected to a MAC server would see a plain ASCII menu.
 
FINGER: Tool for checking user-ids or addresses.
 
FLAME: To insult another person via e-mail -- often on a public
special interest list.

remote service. Telnet allows a user at one site to interact
with a system at another site as if the user's terminal was
connected directly to the remote computer.
 
URL: Uniform Resource Locators are used to identify network
resources. They are used extensively by World Wide Web browsers.

groups) not on the internet but often available via networked
computers. A selection of these newsgroups may be found on
various gopher servers.
 
VERONICA: A tool for searching gopher-space, indexes menu
titles, provides keyword searching. (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented
Net-Wide Index to Computerized Archives)

APPENDIX A: MAKING THE INTERNET CONNECTION
 
 
If you don't already have an Internet account or want to obtain
another account for personal use, the best advice is to ask
colleagues and friends about the best options available in your
region. Local colleges, regional service providers, freenets,
and commercial online services offer a variety of plans at
different price levels. Even if you already have access to the
net you might want an account that offers services not available
in your area, such as usenet news, gopher servers, or slip
access so that you can use gopher clients or www browsers from
home.
 
Types Of Accounts
 
Full Internet access includes two basic types of service:
 
   E-mail based exchanges -- personal mail, special interest
   group lists,  and electronic newsletters and journals;
 
   Remote logons to gopher, www,  and wais, file archives,
   library catalogs, bulletin boards, and an ever-expanding
   list of databases.
 
Partial Internet access usually means connecting to the net via
e-mail. Few of the services offered via remote logon are
available by e-mail at this point, but this may change in the
future.
 
Internet Access Providers In Minnesota
 
Full Internet Access (e-mail, ftp, telnet, Usenet newsgroups)
 
612-342-2570  Minnesota Regional Network -- MRnet
612-624-2323  University of Minnesota Alumni Association
              ($30 membership + $70 per year)
612-626-1600  University of Minnesota Computer and Information
              Services offers individual and corporate accounts
 
Out-of-state providers with local dial access:
 
800-695-4005  Delphi -- offers 5 hour free trial subscription

public data network access is only available in Duluth, Mankato,
Rochester, and St. Cloud. Connecting to most service providers
requires a long distance call, but a few offer toll-free access:
 
800-488-4559    CLASS - for library organizations

APPENDIX B: CREATING A PLAN FILE
 
Warning: Not for the faint-hearted.
 
A plan is a plain text file that contains whatever information a
user wants to store in the file. Usually it is used for mundane
purposes: listing telephone numbers, office hours, favorite
quotations, etc. Scott Yanoff's Special Internet Connections
list mentions several clever examples of user-generated plans
making information available to the Net via finger. Finger is
being used to provide up-to-date information on everything from
earthquakes to sporting events.
 
To set up a plan:
 
1. Create a plan file in your login or root directory. On some
   systems it is called .plan; on others plan.txt. Check with
   your system administrator. Note: Some systems do not allow
   outside access to .plan files.
 
2. Set permission for this file (and o others) to world read
   only. The command is:
   set prot=W:R .plan;*
 
3. You may have to set permission for your root directory to
   world read only. The command is:
                   set prot=W:R diskname:[-]username.dir
