* Section -8- BIBLIOGRAPHY
|===============================================================================
|This section lists useful lists of books articles, and bibliographies. For the sake of compactness, the book list here is short. For longer lists, see the online or paper bibliographies available. I've prepared a list of many books and article readings in CMC and computer networking. That file is the CMC/December bibliography, listed below.
