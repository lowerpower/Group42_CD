1.  INTRODUCTION

1.1.  Statement of Purpose

We have created this guide in order to help administrators
and employees of non-profit, public service organizations
easily locate relevant information on the Internet.
We have worked in conjunction with Metro Detroit Comnet,
a consortium of non-profit social service organizations in
metropolitan Detroit, in order to help identify the topics
that would be useful to their member organizations.  We
hope that the Internet community at large finds the
information in this guide useful as well.

In creating this guide, we have included only resources
that are publicly available on the Internet.  Any resources
that require extra fees for access were omitted.

This guide assumes a basic familiarity with the Internet,
its terminology, and how to find a useful resource given
an Internet address.  If you, in reading this guide, come
across any terms that you do not understand, please refer
to any of the numerous online or print guides to the
Internet.  For beginners, we recommend Ed Krol's "The
Whole Internet: A User's Guide and Catalog," available
in most bookstores.

We welcome any comments or suggestions on this guide, and
we especially encourage readers to send us information on
additional resources we may have missed.  Please forward
any such information to public-services@umich.edu.

A final note for those with World Wide Web access:  an
HTML version of this guide, providing direct access to
the resources described here, is currently available at
http://asa.ugl.lib.umich.edu/chdocs/nonprofits/nonprofits.html.

1.2.  How to Use this Guide

We have organized this guide by subject, as we believe that
will be the easiest way for you to locate the information that
you are interested in finding.  We have attempted to include
as much information about each resource as possible, and have
provided this in the following basic format headings:

TYPE:  Nature of resource:  Gopher, WWW site, mailing list, etc.

ADDRESS:  For mailing lists, this field provides information
on how to post messages.  For other sites, this field gives
the address of the resource and the menus you'll need to
select to find it.

SUBSCRIBE: Subscription information (mailing lists only).

URL:  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used for
locating information on the World Wide Web, a hypertext-
based navigation tool which is becoming widely used.  It
explains the type of access tool used, the address, and
directory needed, using the following basic format:

        tool://host.domain:port/path/file

As an example, one URL for the Clearinghouse where this
guide is located is:
        
        http://http2.sils.umich.edu/~lou/chhome.html

CONTACT:  Who to contact with comments or questions about
a resource.

COMMENTS:  A description of the resource's contents and
and evaluative information to help you determine whether
or not the resource will help you *before* you spend time
trying to find it.

There are numerous ways that you can utilize this guide fully.
We've listed the three primary methods below:

Method #1:  You can easily use this guide online.  Once you
find a section that you are interested in, you can do a
search for that section of the document.  The method for
this will vary depending on the software you are using, but
we will give an example as though you are dialing in using
VT100 emulation (which is the most common form of dial up
access).  For most remote gopher software, you only need to
type either an "s" or a "/" (without the quotes), and you will
be asked to enter a search string.  At this point, type in the
number of the section that you are interested in (or a subject
if you would rather).  For example, if you wanted to go to the
alphabetical index, you would simply type a 7.3 and hit the
enter key, and bingo, you are taken right to the section that
you want.  If all else fails, check your software documentation
or ask your system administrator if you have trouble searching
this (or any other) document.

Method #2:  You can download the document onto a disk and open
it as a word processing file.  This allows you to electronically
search for specific sections by using the "find" function of your
word processing program.  For the best results in keeping the
formatting of this document intact, make sure that the margins
are set to 1" on each side, and the font is set to 10
characters per inch.

Method #3:  You can also print out this document in its
entirety.  We have included an alphabetical index and a tool
index of resources in order to help facilitate the use of a
printed version of the guide.  A 10 cpi printer font will
give the best results.

A NOTE TO THOSE WHO ACCESS INTERNET RESOURCES BY E-MAIL ONLY:
We suggest you retrive the following guide, which will
explain how to access Gopher and WWW resources over
e-mail.  Send an e-mail message to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
with a blank subject, and "GET INTERNET BY-EMAIL NETTRAIN F=MAIL"
(without the quotes) in the message body.


2.  INFORMATION ON NON-PROFIT PUBLIC SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS

2.1.  General Sources

2.1.1.  alt.co-ops

TYPE:      Usenet newsgroup
COMMENTS:
Discussions on this newsgroup cover all aspects of the co-op
and co-op structure, from legal aspects of forming a co-op to the
future of co-ops with regard to the Internet and electronic
communication.  The traffic on this newsgroup has reached the
point of 5-10 messages per day, which makes it an easy newsgroup
to follow.  The discussions are generally quite enthusiastic,
as many of the posters are relatively new to the Internet.
We would expect this list to grow in the future as more co-ops
become an active part of the Internet.

2.1.2.  Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations
        and Voluntary Action discussion list (ARNOVA-L)

TYPE:      E-mail discussion list
ADDRESS:   arnova-l@wvnvm.wvnet.edu (to post)
SUBSCRIBE: E-mail to listserv@wvnvm.wvnet.edu; use "subscribe
           arnova-l <your name>" in message body.  Subscrip-
           tions are not automatic, and requests will be
           forwarded to the list owner.
CONTACT:   Roger Lohmann (rlohman@wvnvm.wvnet.edu)
COMMENTS:
ARNOVA-L is a restricted list aimed at researchers and
research-oriented practititioners interested in non-profit
organizations, volunteerism, and philanthropy.  This list
was started by several members of ARNOVA (the Association
for Research on Non-Profit Organizations and Voluntary
Action) and continues to maintain informal ties to this
organization.  All postings are in English, and although
most subscribers are American, over a dozen countries are
represented in total.  Past messages are archived at the
above Listserv site.

2.1.3.  Australia and New Zealand Third Sector Research
        discussion list (ANZTSR)

TYPE:      E-mail discussion list
ADDRESS:   anztsr@qut.edu.au (to post)

           anztsr" in message body
CONTACT:   Myles McGregor-Lowndes (m.mcgregor@qut.edu.au)
COMMENTS:
This list appears to have branched off the ARNOVA list, and
is dedicated to research on non-profit organizations in
Australia and New Zealand.  As yet, *very* low volume; perhaps
a message every few weeks.

2.1.4.  Center for Civil Society International (CCSI)

          Users in the former Soviet Union can reach the same
          site by telnetting to april.ibpm.serpukhov.su and
          typing "friends" at the login prompt.
URL:      http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/~ccsi/ccsihome.html
CONTACT:  Greg Cole (gcole@solar.rtd.utk.edu) on the USA end
          OR Natasha Bulashova (natasha@ibpm.serpukhov.su) in
          the Newly Independent States (NIS).
COMMENTS:
CCSI is an international clearinghouse for local organizations
in North America to establish links with counterpart organiz-
ations in the former Soviet Union; it helps individuals and
voluntary organizations in Russia and the NIS to identify
North American contacts.  Their home page (accessible through
the above URLs and telnet addresses) is very well organized,
and provides profiles of 140 US organizations, information on
how North Americans can locate service opportunities in the
NIS, funding opportunities, and profiles of voluntary organ-
izations in the NIS.  CCSI also puts out a monthly news
bulletin which is included here.

2.1.5.  Chronicle of Philanthropy mailing list

TYPE:      Electronic mailing list
SUBSCRIBE: Send e-mail to chronicle-request@nonprofit.com; use
           "subscribe chronicle <your name and organization>"

COMMENTS:
The Chronicle of Philanthropy, America's premier magazine for
the nonprofit world, now has an electronic mailing list which
supplements the paper issue.  Every other Tuesday, the editors
will mail out summaries of current issues relating to nonprofits;
on the Tuesdays in between, subscribers will receive listings of
forthcoming conferences and workshops for different regions in
the United States.

2.1.6.  Institute for Global Communications

TYPE:      Gopher
ADDRESS:   gopher gopher.igc.apc.org
URL:       gopher://gopher.igc.apc.org:70/11/orgs
CONTACT:   igc-info@igc.apc.org
COMMENTS:
This Gopher provides space for non-governmental organiz-
ations to inform Internet users as to their programs.
Over thirty organizations are listed here, and their

           notprofit%3aheydorn
CONTACT:   Munn Heydorn (munn@interaccess.com)
COMMENTS:
This is a guide similar to this one, providing a long listing
(few descriptions) of Internet sources of potential use to non-profit
health and human service organizations.  Munn Heydorn's list, in
contrast to this guide, is organized by type of resource (e-mail list,
Gopher, etc.) and includes references to net-based support groups.  It
also provides a lengthy description on how people not hooked up to the
Internet can access the sources.  Aimed at non-profit organizations as
well as the recipients of their services.  Updated frequently.

2.1.9.  Nonprofit Organizations on the Internet

TYPE:      World Wide Web page
URL:       http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/ellens/non.html

CONTACT:   Ellen Spertus (ellens@ai.mit.edu)
COMMENTS:
This is a page consisting of brief descriptions of and links
to national non-profit organizations (some of which are included
in this guide) with information on the World Wide Web.  Many of the
links provide brochure-type information on the various organizations.
Many topics are covered, from food banks to civil liberty to the
performing arts.  An "icon-free" version of this page is available for

TYPE:      Usenet newsgroup
COMMENTS:
Discussions on this group cover all topics related to non-
profits: funding, technology, programming, and whatever else
subscribers wish to discuss. Most contributors seem to be employees
or volunteers of non-profit organizations.  List volume is on the
average 5-10 messages per day.  We find this to be one of the primary
Internet sources for non-profit administrators to consult.  A FAQ
for the group was completed in Nov. 1994 and can be reached as
follows:

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance is a searchable
directory of financial and nonfinancial assistance programs
that "provide benefits to the American Public."  The programs
listed in this database are administered by departments and
establishments of the Federal Government.  This is a very valuable
database, as it is extremely easy to use and contains a wide range
of grants, loans, scholarships and other types of financial
assistance on a wide variety of topics.

include statistics and research and development information
the is aimed toward the improvement of teaching and learning.
The information contained in this gopher obviously deals with
educational institutions, but it also has information on
adult literacy, vocational, and bilingual programs.
This gopher also includes information on School-to-Work
programs that offer funding to state and local institutions
that are working with high school students in order to
provide an easier transition into the workforce.  This gopher
offers a wide variety of information, but it is also indexed,
which means that users can easily search for information
relevant to their needs.

COMMENTS:
Both the FEDIX (Federal Information Exchange Database) and the
MOLIS (Minority On-Line Information Service) were created and
implemented by the Department of Energy and are currently run
in cooperation with various higher education institutions. The
FEDIX database contains information on a wide range of federal
agency programs and opportunities to the higher education
community, including research opportunities, program contacts,
scholarships, research equipment, procurement notices, and
minority opportunities.  The MOLIS database provides compre-
hensive research and institutional data on Historically Black
Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Institutions. This
database includes information on research centers, facilities,
and equipment; pre-college and education programs; scholarships
and fellowships; emerging capabilities; revenues and expen-
ditures, degrees and enrollment; faculty profiles; and
administrative personnel data.

There is a help line that provides assistance to users of
the FEDIX or MOLIS systems.  The number for the help line
is 301-975-0103 and is available Monday through Friday 8:30
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, except on federal holidays.
Free user guides are available on request by calling the
helpline.

HERO (The Higher Education Resources and Opportunities)
provides information for women and minorities seeking grant
and scholarship information.  The database lists the sources
by institution, and as of the creation of this guide, there
were only two institutions participating (Johns Hopkins
University and the University of Virginia).  The information
provide is very general, but it does give contact
information.

COMMENTS:
The Foundation Center in a nonprofit organization that was
established in 1956 to provide a means for easier access to
information on philanthropic giving.  This online resource,
however, does not contain any information on specific grant or
funding opportunities.  What is included in the gopher is a
list, broken down by state, of libraries or other organizations
that offer free access to the many publications that are helpful
to grantseekers.  Included in the entry is an address and phone
number for each institution.  The Web page contains useful
information on researching foundations and current issues of the
Philanthropy News Digest, a periodical which summarizes phil-
anthropy-related articles from the major media.

COMMENTS:
Fundlist is an extremely active list, providing at
least 10 messages per day.  The discussions are limited to
university alumni organizations or other organizations
seeking to raise funds for institutions of higher education.
While much of this information does not directly apply to the
average nonprofit organization, they do discuss _many_
fundraising ideas that could be adapted by other
organizations seeking to raise money.

COMMENTS:
An very inactive list, perhaps one or two messages per
week.  The stated goal of this list is to "to promote
external funding  for international education and research."
Following its proposed goal, the list offers information on
international travel grants and international funding
opportunities, but it also provides some general grant
information, such as conferences or workshops that are
currently being offered.  The list is archived by month.

2.2.7.  Granting Agency Deadlines

TYPE:      Gopher

           location via Gopher menus.  If anyone reading
           this manages to find it, please let us know!
URL:       gopher://ukcc.uky.edu/1menu%20UKR200%21191/
           DEADLINE.INFO
CONTACT:   Not provided
COMMENTS:
This gopher lists deadlines for many government and non-
government granting agencies.  Included are four broad subject
categories of agencies:
        Arts/Humanities/International
        Education/Human and Community Development
        Health/Mental Health
        Science/Engineering
Each category is then broken down by agency, listed in
alphabetical order.   Only by going one step further does the
user actually get to a list of the programs.  For each
program, there is a brief description of the scope of the
program, most recent deadlines and an address and phone
number to contact for more information.  Many of the
deadlines listed for these programs are not kept up to date,
which would make it necessary to contact the agency directly
in order to get the current information.  This is an
excellent database to use to get an idea of funding
opportunities available for various types of organizations.

2.2.8.  National Institute of Health Grants

CONTACT:   The NIH Institutional Affairs Office
           (301) 496-5366
           (gopher@gopher.nih.gov)
COMMENTS:
The National Institute of Health Grants gopher deals
primarily with research-oriented, health-related issues.
Many of their programs are designed to be obtained in
conjuction with a university or large research facility, which
does not suit the information in this database very well for
the smaller nonprofit organizations.  Larger nonprofits,
however, may find much of this information useful.  The
information in this gopher is easily searchable, which limits
the amount of time needed to browse through the many listings
to see if there are any funding opportunities that match the
grant seeker's topic.  It is possible to search for programs
that were announced within the last 6 weeks, or for programs
that have been announced from 1992 to the present.  For each
program listing, there is a fairly detailed program
description, deadline dates, the issue of the NIH Guide in
which the announcement was included.

COMMENTS:
This is an excellent place to begin searching for potential
funding information.  This gopher clusters all of the sources
cited above into one menu, which makes going from one source
to another significantly easier.  This gopher also includes the
_Grant Getters Guide to the Internet_, which is a well designed

organization designed to help other nonprofit leaders improve their
management skills.  Though many of the menu items are still under
construction, it currently provides answers to common questions about

Includes the full text of the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990 and much more.  Also provided are an overview of the
Act, with regulations specifically for public services, and
guidelines for specific facilities to follow when providing
accessibility.  Non-profit administrators may also be interested
in the texts of two other public laws available here:
the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984, and the Technology-
Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of
1988.  An excellent starting point.

4.2.  Bureau of the Census

CONTACT:   gatekeeper@census.gov
COMMENTS:
The Gopher site (gopher.census.gov) includes numerous
PostScript files on the demographics of particular ethnic
groups and text files of data from the County and City Data
Book (state and local rankings and data; includes
poverty rankings by city), among other things.  Many might
find it inconvenient to have to download PostScript files
before they can be used, and this gopher is not as organized
as it could be.  For this reason, we suggest these additional
sites for Census data.  The Census Bureau gopher does include
links to these sites.

The University of Michigan Library Gopher,
gopher://una.hh.lib.umich.edu:70/00/census
(US summaries from 1990 census; detailed analyses of
Michigan state, county, and township data)

The University of Missouri Gopher,
gopher://bigcat.missouri.edu:70/00/reference/census
(Basic Tables from 1990 census, Basic Demographic Trends
in ASCII and Lotus format, population estimates for
counties)

The Census Bureau's WWW site (http://www.census.gov/) is
quite new and undergoes revision regularly, but for the most
part the data available here is the same as on its Gopher.
The "Other Excellent Sites" section links to other Census
information providers on the net.

COMMENTS:
This Gopher, a publication of the US Department of Justice's
Bureau of Justice Statistics, provides press releases and
statistics on the perpetrators and victims of crime in the US.
Although it may seem as if most of the statistics are out of
date as they only cover crime activity up to 1993, most of the
statistics here were not available to be published until
1994.  Topics range from figures on violence against women to
the race of prisoners to child rape victims.  Most of the
additions to this gopher seem fairly recent, but we were not
able to tell how often it is updated.

AmeriCorps national service programs, final regulations, service
programs, a mission statement, a resource guide, and press
releases.  A final section gives the recipients of national
service grants to institutes of higher education.  The information
here is organized fairly coherently, although we were unable
to tell how often it is updated.  The Americans Communicating
Electronically (one gopher-level up) gopher is
also an excellent resource for government information.

The LegiSlate gopher has available information about all
bills from the 104th Congress, arranged by subject
category.  (Bills are also organized alphabetically, by
sponsor, by chamber, and are searchable by keyword.)
Of special interest to public service non-profits are
"family, welfare, and human services," "health and medicine,"
and "housing and urban development."  Included are the full
text of the each bill (typically the last option), a brief
description, a short legislative history, and
more.  The subject categories here are fairly simple, and
searching by keyword will likely locate any relevant bill.

Because the various agencies of the Department of Commerce

to have one location (the WWW site) that ties them all together.
It links to all DOC agencies and programs with information on the
net, including the two Gophers mentioned above.  Also included is the
current US Budget.  However, the layout of the WWW page isn't the
easiest to follow, as it isn't clear how the various agencies
fit together.

4.8.  Department of Health and Human Services

TYPE:      Gopher and WWW site
ADDRESS:   gopher gopher.os.dhhs.gov
URL:       gopher://gopher.os.dhhs.gov:71/

           Bob Cooley (bcooley@os.dhhs.gov) (for Gopher site)
COMMENTS: The DHHS Home Page (WWW site) links to the below sites as well
as to sites of other agencies of DHHS.  Also included are its mission
statement and a staff directory, as well as abstracts of DHHS program
evaluations. It's fairly well organized, given that this Web page is
brand new and still under construction.  The Gopher site contains
primarily the same information; more easily located here is the Admin-
istration for Children and Families, which gives specific details on
its programs and grants.

4.8.1.  Federal Poverty Guidelines

TYPE:      Single document
URL:       http://www.os.dhhs.gov/0/aspe/poverty/poverty.html
CONTACT:   US Department of Health and Human Services
COMMENTS:
This document lists the guidelines for what is defined as
"living in poverty" for the fifty states and Washington, DC,
in 1994.  It was previously published in the February 10,
1994, _Federal Register_, but having it available on the World
Wide Web is handy for quick reference.  These guidelines were
developed by the Department of Health and Human Services.

4.8.2.  Health Care Finance Administration (Medicare and
        Medicaid)

TYPE:      World Wide Web page
URL:       http://www.ssa.gov/hcfa/hcfahp2.html
CONTACT:   tanzalon@gate.hcfa.gov
COMMENTS:
Here, the Health Care Finance Administration posts press
releases, research initiatives, and general information
about the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Information here
is updated fairly frequently.  Of special note is the Medicare
1994 Handbook.  Unfortunately, a file supposedly containing 85
commonly asked questions about the HCFA is currently blank,
but this will likely change in the near future.

4.8.3.  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

TYPE:      Weekly report
ADDRESS:   gopher cwis.usc.edu / The Health Science Campus /
           Periodicals / Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
URL:       gopher://cwis.usc.edu/00/The_Health_Science_Campus
           /Periodicals/mmwr
CONTACT:   Not provided
COMMENTS:
Provided here is the most current issue as well as back
issues from June 1993 to the present.  The most current issue
is a bit inconveniently located, being last in a long string of
menu choices.  Reported here are results of research on morbidity
and mortality as well as recent statistics.  Each issue is
approximately 30-40 pages (~45K) long.

4.8.4.  Social Security Administration

TYPE:      Gopher and WWW page
ADDRESS:   gopher oss968.ssa.gov
URL:       gopher://oss968.ssa.gov:70/1

           webmaster@ssa.gov for WWW page
           OR 1-800-772-1213
COMMENTS:
In the SSA's Gopher are general information on Social
Security cards, benefits, and statistics from the Social
Security Bulletin, among other things.  In addition, the
Frequently Asked Questions list will likely save a lot of
calls to the national office.  A positive step, however, is
a Spanish version of everything on this Gopher under the
first menu option.  The World Wide Web page contains
everything on the Gopher with the addition of the Handbook,
a policy forum, the current annual report, the FY95 budget,
and the full text of general informational publications.
The SSA will become an independent agency on March 31, 1995.

4.9.  Department of Housing and Urban Development

TYPE:      Gopher
ADDRESS:   gopher gopher.hud.gov
URL:       gopher://gopher.hud.gov:70/1/
CONTACT:   postmaster@hud.gov
COMMENTS:
At the present time, the only menu items which present
information on HUD are its mission statement (from 10/93)
and some functions of the various HUD offices.  The other
options - over  90% of menu choices - lead nowhere
or are unavailable, which is unfortunate.  It was not clear
whether this Gopher is still under construction.  Two main
menu items, PAVNET (section 5.13.3 below) and Americans
Communicating Electronically are indeed useful sources but
have little direct relation to the functions of HUD.

As things stand now, this Gopher isn't terribly useful.  We
are including mention of it in this guide in the hopes that one
day things will be fixed.

4.10.  Enterprise Communities and Empowerment Zones

TYPE:      Gopher
ADDRESS:   gopher cyfer.esusda.gov / Americans Communicating
           Electronically / Enterprise Communities and

           urban programs
           Beverly Gillot (rda@tele.fmha.gov) for questions on
           rural programs
COMMENTS:
Includes press releases, speeches, and general information on
the EC/EZ programs, including descriptions of available
resources, a FAQ ("Frequently Asked Questions") list about rural
and urban EC/EZs, contact names by state, and an application guide.
Some files are also available in WordPerfect and PostScript formats.
Many of the guides here are actually the texts of press releases
and briefings.  A useful collection of primary source material about
the programs.  The Gopher is well organized for the most part,
but it is not always clear from the titles just what the
binary files contain.

4.11.   Federal Register (Full Text)

TYPE:      Telnet site
ADDRESS:   telnet to 128.206.1.3 (via Columbia Online Information
           Network) OR
           telnet to 198.137.188.2 (via Seattle Public Library)
URL:       telnet://128.206.1.3 OR telnet://198.137.188.2
CONTACT:   Not provided
COMMENTS:
At last, the full text of the Federal Register is available
free of charge on the Internet, via two community-based systems:
Columbia Online Information Network (COIN) in Columbia, MO, and
the Seattle (WA) Public Library.  Both sites contain the same
information, so use whichever has the least traffic.  At both
locations, information from the Federal Register is searchable
by keyword.  There is a maximum number of logins each system
can handle at once (usu. 5) so searching during off hours would
be a good idea.

Instructions for accessing FR from COIN:  telnet to 128.206.1.3,
log in as "guest," and select the following from the menus:
  (5) Government Center
   (4) Access the Government Center
    (2) United States of America
     (1) GPO Access
Enter your terminal type (usually vt100).  Use the arrow keys to
select a database, and mark your choice by pressing <space> then
<enter>.  At this point, enter the keywords you want to search on.

Instructions for accessing FR from Seattle:  telnet to 198.137.188.2,
log in as "library," set your terminal correctly (usually vt100), and
select the following menu choices:
 (14) Internet and Seattle Community Net
  (1) Internet and Seattle Community Network
   (3) Government Printing Office Online Access
Press "c" to connect.  You may be asked to reenter your terminal type.
At this point, follow the directions above for selecting a database
and searching by keyword.

4.12.  Internal Revenue Service

TYPE:      World Wide Web page
URL:       http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/irs/irs.html
CONTACT:   Not provided
COMMENTS:
Tax forms, directions for filing, and a list of answers to
frequently asked questions are available here on the IRS's
Web page.  As of early February 1995, 1994 tax forms are not
available here yet, but with luck this will change soon.  In
order to view the forms, you will need the Adobe Acrobat
reader (a piece of software available for download here).

4.13.  State Government Information on the Internet

COMMENTS:
Gopher Jewels (a system of organizing Gopher resources by
subject) includes a list of state government gophers, listed
by state.  Because each Gopher here is organized by a different
group of people from almost every state, no generalizations can
be made about their contents.  In any case, the address is provided
here for non-profits interested in learning more about state
government information sources.


5.  INFORMATION ON HUMAN SERVICE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES

5.1.  Sources Covering Entire Realm of Human Services

5.1.1.  AT&T 800 Directory on the Internet

TYPE:      World Wide Web site

           (dir800@mail.att.net)
           OR call 1-800-562-2255 for information.
COMMENTS:
This WWW site contains the electronic version of AT&T's
directory of 1-800 phone numbers (although the documentation
states that not everything from the printed version is
duplicated here).  At present, one can access these numbers
either alphabetically by category or organization name;
keyword searching capabilities are expected shortly.
Though most of the entries are for companies and products,
there are many categories which could be used by non-profits
for information and referral.  Of note are the categories
"social service organizations," "adoption services," "child
abuse information and treatment centers," "women's organ-
izations," and more.  Some numbers belong to local or state
organizations, while others belong to national hotlines.
Keyword searching will greatly improve access to this site.

COMMENTS:
This system is part of the Evaluation Center at the Human
Services Research Institute, and is funded to help provide
assistance with the evaluation of adult mental health
system change.  This gopher can be broken down into four
separate parts, all of which revolve around different
aspects of adult mental health system evaluation and health
care reform.  Each part is actually a listserv discussion
group that is archived at this gopher site.  The four parts
are as follows:

NHCTEN (Topical Evaluation Network on National Health Care
Reform) - which focuses on the effects of the national health
care reforms on mental health care and substance abuse systems.
To subscribe to the listserv, send an e-mail message to:
majordomo@world.std.com with "subscribe nhcten" as the
message body.

OUTCOME (Topical Evaluation Network on Outcomes
Evaluation) - which attempts to "develop a broad
collective expertise with regard to problems assessing
and analyzing outcomes of interventions aimed at improving
mental health."  To subscribe to the listserv, send an
e-mail message to:
majordomo@world.std.com with "subscribe outcometen" as
the message body

LEGALTEN (Topical Evaluation Network on Legal & Forensic
Issues in Mental Health) - focuses on the relationship
between the mental health system, the criminal justice
system and the courts.  To subscribe, send an e-mail
message to:
majordomo@world.std.com with "subscribe legalten" as the
message body

EVALTEN (Topical Evaluation Network on Evaluation
Methodology & Statistics) - focuses on providing a
network of individuals to provide all aspects of survey
development and statistical analysis of mental health
systems.  To subscribe to this discussion list, send
an e-mail message to:
majordomo@world.std.com with "subscribe evalten" as the
message body.

There is also a File by Mail Server which allows users that
only have e-mail access to send for files.  To learn how to
use this service send an e-mail message to the following address:
tecinfo@hsri.org, with "request" (in all lowercase letters)
as the subject line and "get help" as the message body.

5.1.7.  National Empowerment Center

CONTACT:   Not available
COMMENTS:
This resources contains a vast wealth of information.
Some of the topics included at this site are : the
Americans with Disabilities Employers Manual and other
ADA information, depression, health care and health care
reform, disability statistics, etc.  The list is quite
impressive (and too long to include in its entirety).
Many of the sources are papers or text documents that
present a perspective on a particular issue, such as the
document entitled _Invisible in the U.S.A._ which discusses
post-recovery experiences for mentally ill persons.
Of particular interest might the informtion regarding the
following:

Gifts in Kind America, which is an organization that
collects and redistributes used computer equipment to
non-profit organizations.

Information regarding the National Institute on Disability
and Rehabilitation Research, which includes disability and
rehabilitation research.

This is certainly a site worth taking a moment to look at, as it contains
a wealth of potentially useful information.

5.1.8.  National Referral Center Master File

TYPE:     Telnet site / Database
ADDRESS:  telnet to locis.loc.gov / choose "organizations"
          from main menu
URL:      telnet://locis.loc.gov
CONTACT:
COMMENTS:
We cannot emphasize enough the potential value this
database from the Library of Congress holds for non-
profit organizations wishing to contact organizations
with similar focus across the country.  The system
contains over 12,000 entries for American organizations,
including address, phone, information services provided
by each, areas of concern, a brief description, their
library holdings, publications they produce, and whether
there is any charge to use their services (most will
provide information about their organizations and programs
at no charge).

The database can be used as an instant "information and
referral service" to find information on or to direct clients
to a variety of national, state, and local organizations.
The one drawback to this database is its user-unfriendli-
ness; we suggest going through the help screens thoroughly.
One hint:  "BRWS <subject-area>" will display the names of
all organizations concerned with a given subject.  Searches
can also be limited to a given city or state if desired.

5.1.9.  Penpages

TYPE:      Telnet Databases
ADDRESS:   telnet psupen.psu.edu / login as your two letter
           state abbreviation (MI, NY, etc.) or as WORLD if you

           BITNET:    PPMENU@PSUPEN
           Phone:     (814) 863-3449
COMMENTS:
Penpages is a series of full text databases that can easily be
searched in order to find relevant information on a wide variety
of topics.   Because Penpages is maintained by the College of
Agricultural Sciences at Pennsylvania State University, there
is a tremendous amount of agricultural oriented information.
The system is certainly not limited to agricultural
information, which makes useful for most any organization.
The following databases are included in Penpages:
           IFAN - International Food And Nutrition database
           MAPP - National Family Database
           Senior Series Database
           The 4-H Youth Development Database
           Cooperative Extension System (CES) Diversity &
              Pluralism Database
These databases provide a wide range of documents that can be
obtained through Penpages.  The databases are all searched
simultaneously, so that users do not need to attempt to determine
which database fits their needs best.  The documents are provided
by universities and other organizations that have created documents
that fit the scope of Penpages and credit and contact information
is given for each article.  The documents are arranged by topics,
such as homeless, aging or youth, which makes searching for
documents fairly easy.  The system is different than most other
Internet accessible databases, so it may take the user a few extra
minutes the first time that Penpages is used.  Once you've learned
how to maneuver within the system, finding information should be
fairly easy.

5.1.10.  Social Work discussion list (SOCWORK)

           socwork <your name>" in message body
CONTACT:   Cindy L. Jones (cljones@uafsysb.uark.edu)
COMMENTS:
A high-volume list (10-20 messages per day), SOCWORK
contains discussion among social workers both in academia
and out in the field.  Members typically talk about social
programs currently in progress and ask advice to see how
their peers would handle a given situation.  As with many
high-volume lists, flame wars occasionally develop.  However,
this is a forum recommended to all interested in social work,
especially those individuals involved in the running of
a shelter or crisis service organization (if their mailboxes
can handle it).  NOTE: New list address as of 2/95.

COMMENTS:
The primary purpose of this Web page is to make available
photos and descriptions of children available for adoption
via international adoption agencies.  Also here is an
excellent listing of adoption information available

asked questions about adoption (quite a comprehensive
list) is forthcoming.

COMMENTS:
The Children, Youth, and Family Consortium was established in
1991.  The Gopher contains many statistical reports, brochures
and newsletters which include such topics as poverty rates,
fertility rates, teen gun deaths, and poverty among single
mothers, to name a few.  The gopher also contains the _KID COUNT
DataBook_, an electronic book that contains a wealth of
information regarding the situation of children in our
society.  Included in the _KID COUNT DataBook_ are chapters on
children dependent on AFDC, children born to mothers under 18
and abused and neglected children.  While much of the information
is specific to Minnesota, some of it is also broadened to include
the entire nation.

This gopher contains information about collaborative efforts
between universities, government and public service/community
oriented organizations that provide services to at risk children,
youths and families.  The gopher is broken down by the type of
programs that are being pursued.  These programs include the
following:
           Child Care
           Collaborations (technical assistance to Youth at Risk
              programs)
           Family Resiliency

The ParentLink Community Connection is a listing of organizations
that provide human services in the state of Missouri.  The program
is easily identify organizations that provide the type of service

This gopher is generally geared toward local government managers,
although the information contained in it could also prove quite
useful to non-profit organizations (particularly those working
closely with local government units).  This gopher contains
descriptions of actual projects used by local government to
overcome difficult political, financial, and policy difficulties.
Each description contains a brief description of programs that
worked, along with contact information to allow the user to
obtain more detailed information.  The gopher is searchable, so
that the user can easily locate project descriptions that match
their situation.  The database contains articles on a wide
variety of topics, which makes it a useful resource for just
about any organization working with local governments.

Both of these sites provide links to local community

This gopher, part of the National Agriculture Library of the

According to information on the gopher, nutritionists at the
above address will respond to questions regarding nutrition with
printouts from the AGRICOLA database (if necessary).  No actual
databases or software packages are available through the Internet,

guide).  It did contain information regarding ftp archives for
software, but that was about it.  I expect that the empty menus

COMMENTS:
This discussion list is an extremely active list, producing
at least 10 messages per day.  Most of the discussion
revolves around personal experiences with alcohol, drug
abuse, Alcoholics Anonymous, or other individual situations.
Although it does also include some information that is useful
to administrators of nonprofit organizations, such as
conference announcements, most of the discussions are
reminicent of support groups or philosophical debates over
the nature of alcohol or drug abuse.  This tends to make
this list extremely difficult to use as a means to easily
