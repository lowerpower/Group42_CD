      It is the intent of the DDN Network Information Center (NIC) to
      make the DDN New User Guide widely available to DDN users at
      minimal cost.  It may be obtained in hardcopy or machine-readable
      form from several sources.  Military users may obtain hardcopy
      from the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC); DTIC can
      provide the ordering number.  For non-military users--such as
      contractors, systems personnel, and researchers--who have access
      to File Transfer Protocol (FTP), copies are available online. 
      The file NETINFO/NUG.DOC contains an ASCII sequential text
      version.  Also, the NIC will make every effort to assist key
      military DDN Points of Contact (POCs) in providing copies of this
      Guide to their user communities.

                       SECTION 1.  INTRODUCTION


1.1    Welcome

Welcome to the Defense Data Network, or the DDN, as it is more commonly
called.  The DDN is a powerful operational military network.  It might be
thought of as an "umbrella" network composed of several large segments or
subnetworks.  The unclassified portion of the DDN is a subnetwork known as
the MILNET.  The MILNET connects the DDN to an even larger network that
includes military contractors, universities, and research centers; this
entire collection of interconnected networks is called the Internet.  Its
users number in the millions.  It is the MILNET on which this document
focuses.

The DDN New User Guide explains the policies, concepts, and conventions of
the DDN, with major emphasis on the MILNET.  The Guide contains an overview
of and a tutorial introduction to the DDN, along with descriptions of its
more interesting network programs and services.  It is not intended to be
a highly technical document, and it does not cover the procedures for
attaching hardware, terminals, or other equipment to the network.  This
information is provided in other documents [1,2].

Originally, the MILNET was an integral part of the research network known
as the ARPANET (after the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was the
sponsor).  In 1984, the MILNET and the ARPANET were physically separated,
and gateways* were installed to allow traffic to be interchanged between the
MILNET and the research networks sponsored by DARPA (the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency).  By 1990, the original ARPANET technology had
become obsolete, and the ARPANET was discontinued in June of that year.

The DDN affords its users a wealth of services and resources.  Many of your
colleagues already work on the network, and you will be able to communicate
with them quickly and easily even though they may be hundreds of miles away. 

The DDN also allows you to participate in discussions about topics of
interest to you and gives you the opportunity to use network programs and
tools to enhance your own capabilities.

Using a computer network is not difficult.  However, as with any new tool,
using it proficiently requires learning some procedures and guidelines and
practicing your new skills.  The DDN New User Guide will provide the
background information necessary to get you started.  We hope you find it a
useful introduction to the DDN.



1.2  Using This Guide

The DDN New User Guide is written for the beginning user and should be
supplemented with reading from other sources.  Network-specific terms are
defined both in context and in the Glossary (Section 11).  Throughout the
text, references appear in the form "[n]".  The bracketed numbers refer to
citations in the Bibliography (Section 10), which lists documents containing
additional explanatory or background information.  Also, check online help

*  Gateways are special computers with the capability of interconnecting
   networks.  Gateways are necessary when routing messages through more
   than one network.

systems and the documentation that usually accompanies the network programs
you use.  (Watch for pointers to online help files when you first access a
program or service.)  We encourage you to expand your knowledge of the
network by consulting these and other information sources whenever you can.

The Guide is divided into sections and subsections, each covering topics of
interest to a new user.  A summary of the contents of each section follows.

    *  Section 1 (this section) is a brief introduction to the Guide.

    *  Section 2, The Defense Data Network, describes the structure of the
       DDN and its administration.  It also describes the MILNET and the
       role of the Defense Network System Organization (DNSO).  It provides
       a brief historical sketch of the evolution of the DDN from the
       original ARPANET.

    *  Section 3, Network Connection, describes the ways in which various
       machines access the network.

    *  Section 4, DDN TAC Access, describes the procedures for obtaining and
       using a TAC Access Card and provides detailed procedures for
       accessing the network through a Terminal Access Controller (TAC) or a
       Mini-TAC.  Also included is background information that will be
       helpful to TAC and Mini-TAC users, such as common error messages,
       TAC commands, and instructions for performing file transfers.

    *  Section 5, Network Use, provides "how-to" instructions for some of
       the DDN's most useful services, such as electronic mail programs,
       FTP, and TELNET.

    *  Section 6, The DDN Network Information Center (NIC), describes in
       detail the databases, programs, files, documents, and services
       offered by the NIC.

    *  Section 7, Security Considerations and Network Conduct, explains the
       legal and courtesy standards of the network.  The importance of host
       and network security is discussed, and in Section 7.1, the
       requirements for legitimate access to the DDN are defined.  Be sure
       to read the etiquette section (Section 7.3).  Adhering to the
       guidelines given there will decrease your chances of unwittingly
       offending other users during your first days on the net.

    *  Section 8, Network Concepts Overview, provides some background
       information on terms and concepts that a new user might hear but not
       understand.  This section includes discussions on topics such as the
       Domain Name System (DNS), network addressing, Government Open Systems
       Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), and gateway concentrators.

    *  Section 9, Network Service Centers and Contacts, describes network
       service providers and how to reach them. The DDN Network Information
       Center (NIC) is logically the first place to look for information
       unavailable at the local level.  The NIC can help you solve network
       use problems, locate documents and resources, or identify appropriate
       points of contact (POCs) for further assistance.

    *  Sections 10 and 11 are a Bibliography and a Glossary of terms used
       in this guide.

    *  The appendices contain information about resources available to
       network users and answers to some of the questions most often asked
       by new users.

    *  A feedback form is located at the back of the Guide.  We encourage
       our readers to use the form to make suggestions or point out errors. 
       We value your comments and suggestions and will consider them for
       future versions of the DDN New User Guide.  You may also send
       suggestions online to NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL.


NOTE:  Typographical conventions cannot be reproduced in the on-line version
       of this guide.  See title page for information on ordering a text-
       enhanced and illustrated copy of the DDN New User Guide.


1.3  Document Conventions

This document uses several printing conventions to identify the difference
between characters you type (input) and those that a computer prints to your
screen (output).  These conventions are described below.

Unless otherwise indicated, all user input is terminated by pressing the
carriage return or Enter key on your keyboard.  (Pressing this key does not
cause a visible character to be printed.)  In this document, the carriage
return or Enter key is represented as <Return>.  Both input and output
are characterized by a typewriter-like font to further differentiate them
from the surrounding text.


1.3.1  User Input Display

Your input (i.e., the characters you type) is represented in bold typeface:

         Your input looks like this.     


1.3.2  Machine Output Display

A non-bold, non-proportional font represents machine prompts, messages, and
other output.
      
        Machine text looks like this.   
      


1.3.3  Comment Display

In examples or instructions, Italics indicate comments we have inserted
for further clarification.

       Our comments look like this.


1.3.4  Typing Control Characters

In using the network, it may sometimes be necessary for you to type special
characters known as control characters.  These characters are often
represented in documentation by a letter prefixed with the circumflex
character "^"--e.g., ^y.  When entering these control characters, you must
press the control key simultaneously with the desired letter.

INTRODUCTION                                                            Page 4


For example, if you see a "^y" in input instructions, this indicates a
control-y, and it means that you should press the control key while you type
the letter "y".   Throughout this Guide, the control key is represented by the

                   SECTION 2.  THE DEFENSE DATA NETWORK


2.1  Network Overview

When you access a local computer, you are largely unaware of what kind of
link connects your terminal to the computer you wish to use.  The terminal
seems to be the computer, since it prints or displays what is happening. 
As you progress in your work, you may need to move data from your local
computer onto another computer, or you may wish to send a message to a
colleague working on a computer at a distant location.  At this point, the
usefulness of a communication network becomes apparent.

A communication network is a group of computers joined by data-carrying
links. A network may be as small as two or three personal computers tied
together by local telephone lines and located in the same building, or it
may be a vast complex of computers spread over the world, whose data links
include long-haul telephone lines, satellite relays, fiber-optic cables, or
radio links.  It is also possible for several different networks to be
interconnected to form an "internetwork" or "internet."

Everyone is familiar with telephones.  Phone sets inside the house connect
to outside lines that lead into nearby local or regional telephone exchanges. 
These exchanges are connected to make up one or more national telephone
systems.  The national telephone systems communicate with each other to make
up an international telephone network.  There are also private telephone
systems that have their own equipment and are totally separate from the
public telephone system.

Computer networks follow a similar pattern.  Local area networks (called
LANs) may connect computers within a building or in different buildings. 
A LAN may remain separate, or it may interconnect to regional, national, or
worldwide commercial or government networks.  Many of these large and small
networks are gradually interconnecting through gateways to form a worldwide
system of data networks similar to the telephone system.  Indeed, since many
computer networks use telephone communication lines to carry data from one
computer to the next, the two systems are closely interwoven.

You do not need detailed knowledge of this technology to use a network, but
you do need to understand the concept of going through layers of equipment
and interconnections.  Effective network use also requires knowing the
online addresses of people or machines with which you wish to communicate
and knowing your own network address as well.

The DDN is a special kind of data network known as a packet-switched network. 
On this network, a terminal or a source host computer (generally just called
a host) passes a message along with its destination address to the local
Packet Switching Node (PSN)* computer.  The PSN breaks the message into
packets, or smaller chunks of data.  Each of these packets has the same
destination address and source address as the original message, plus a
sequence number indicating which piece of the original message it represents.
The packets are passed from PSN to PSN until they reach the destination PSN,
where they are reassembled in their original order and delivered to the
destination host.

A packet switched network differs from a circuit-switched network in that no
predetermined dedicated path exists for delivery of the data.  Each packet
takes the best route that it can find at the time, and all the packets in a

_____________
  *  PSNs were originally called Interface Message Processors, or IMPs.

message do not necessarily take the same route.  Once the packets arrive at
the destination PSN, they are reassembled in the correct sequence and
delivered to the destination host as a complete message.


2.2  Network Access Methods

The Defense Data Network (DDN) is made up of a variety of equipment.  Its
users provide terminals, modems, leased circuits to the PSN, and host
computers.  The DDN supplies node computers, encryption equipment, and some
support services.  You can reach the network from your terminal in several
ways by using different combinations of hardware in conjunction with
different network programs.  These network connection methods are shown in
Figure 2-1.

THE DEFENSE DATA NETWORK                                                Page 7


A terminal may reach a host in several ways.  

    *     A wire or cable may run directly from the terminal to the
          computer; this is called a hard-wired terminal.  

    *     A terminal may communicate with a computer via a telephone
          connected to the terminal through a modem or acoustic coupler;
          this is called a dial-up terminal.

Dial-up terminals can connect to the network at speeds of from 300 to 9600
bits per second (bps).  A speed of 1200 bps is common in the continental
United States, while 1200 bps is more common in Europe. 

       [NOTE:  The speed setting of both your terminal and your modem
       must be the same to enable the two devices to communicate properly
       with one another.]

With the appropriate equipment, personal computers may also be used as
terminals.  In this case, the personal computer emulates (or acts like) a
terminal when it is used in terminal mode.

A terminal may be directly attached to a local area network (LAN) or to a
local switch (similar to a telephone switch).  The user of such a terminal
can reach any computer on the LAN or any computer connected to the switch.
The LAN may also be connected to the DDN through a gateway, which is a
computer whose software can direct traffic from the LAN onto the larger
long-haul network and vice versa.


2.3  Organization of the DDN

The Defense Data Network is a large military common-user data communications
internetwork operated for the Department of Defense (DoD) by the Defense
Network Systems Organization (DNSO) of the Defense Information Systems Agency
(DISA).  The DDN is made up of several networks.  The MILNET is the DDN
network that is connected to the Internet.


2.4  Development of the DDN

As mentioned previously, the MILNET is an unclassified military network that
is part of the DDN.  It was built using technology developed as part of the
ARPANET, which was the prototype packet-switched network.

The ARPANET was built by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
in 1969 as an  experiment to determine the viability of a store-and-forward,
host-to-host, packet-switched network.  The network designers wanted to
demonstrate that computers made by different manufacturers, of different
sizes, and running different operating systems, could communicate with one
another across a network.  It was envisioned that users of such a network
could share programs and communicate via the network with other users at
distant locations.  The experiment was successful, and today many data
networks are modeled after the ARPANET.

In 1979, the Department of Defense decided to interconnect several DoD long-
haul computer networks through a set of internet protocols so that these
networks could share the same backbone of node computers linked by high-speed
telephone lines.  Protocols are rules or standards by which computers
communicate on a network.  The ARPANET protocols were developed by researchers
known as the Internet Working Group (IWG), under the sponsorship of the DARPA
Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO).  The protocols were tested



NIC 60001, February 1993
THE DEFENSE DATA NETWORK                                                Page 8


for several years on the ARPANET, and they proved useful for creating the
networking environment that the DoD wanted.

In 1982, the DoD issued a directive [3] adopting a single set of
communications protocols based on the ARPANET protocols.  This was followed
later in 1982 by a directive [4] to create the DDN as a parent, or umbrella,
operational military network made up of several existing or planned DoD
computer networks.

By 1983, the ARPANET, which was still considered an experimental network, had
grown to over 300 computers, many used for day-to-day operational military
purposes as well as for research.  Other military users were seeking
networking services.  To meet this growing need for an operational military
network, the DoD evaluated several network architectures and finally chose
the DARPA Internet architecture as the model for its common-user
communications network, the DDN.

In September 1984, the original ARPANET was split into two separate
unclassified networks--a military research and development network (ARPANET)
and a military operational communications network (MILNET).  The split
returned to DARPA a network for experimentation and established an
unclassified military network able to accommodate the DoD's growing
operational needs.

In June 1990, the ARPANET was officially dissolved.  Many sites that were
formerly part of the ARPANET are now connected to the National Science
Foundation Network, NSFnet.  The MILNET remains under the administration of
DISA.  Plans for upgrading and expanding the current network are now underway.

A Defense Research Internet (DRI) will meet defense needs, while the National
Research and Education Network (NREN) will provide a national forum for
research and education.


2.5    The Defense Information Systems Agency, Defense Network Systems
       Organization (DISA DNSO)

DISA's Defense Network Systems Organization (DNSO) evolved from the Defense
Communications System Organization in 1991 (the same year in which DISA
evolved from the Defense Communications Agency).  The DNSO handles overall
management and operations.  It also sets policy guidelines and assists new
military subscribers in bringing their computers and related equipment onto
the DDN.

The DNSO provides many services to network users and potential network
subscribers.  It is responsible for

       *     Keeping the network "up and running,"
       *     Providing user assistance,
       *     Setting policies and guidelines,
       *     Anticipating growth and expansion,
       *     Assisting new subscribers.

Among its other duties, the DNSO also

       *     Manages access control and security for the network backbone,
       *     Designates host and node contacts,
       *     Coordinates military sponsors,
       *     Provides technical management of contracts for services,
             equipment, and software obtained from outside vendors.



NIC 60001, February 1993
THE DEFENSE DATA NETWORK                                                Page 9


To provide operational management support for the DDN, the DISA DNSO has
designated a person to act as the primary Point of Contact (POC) for
operations for each of the DDN networks.  For example, the MILNET Manager is
responsible for MILNET operations.  One of his/her duties is to approve all
host connections to the MILNET and all changes to such connections.  For
information about how to contact the current MILNET Manager or any of the
other DDN network managers, you may call the DDN Network Information Center. 
(See Section 6.1.1.)

                      SECTION 3.  NETWORK CONNECTION


3.1  Host Access

To open a connection through the network from one host to another, you must
first log in to one of the hosts from a terminal.  After logging in, you may
open a connection across the network to a second host.  Once this connection
is established, you may log in to the remote host computer and work there. 
When you finish and log out of the remote computer, the network connection
is closed and you are back where you began--still logged in to the first host.
In this way, it is easy to use the resources of more than one computer
(assuming that you have a valid account on each system).

The direct host-to-host connection just described is called a TELNET
connection.  TELNET is a valuable network tool because it lets you use
programs and utilities on remote machines that may not be available locally. 
You may also open a specialized host-to-host link called a file transfer or
FTP connection.  (FTP is the acronym for File Transfer Protocol.)  FTP
allows you to copy or transfer files from one host to another.  Sections
5.1.2 and 5.1.3 provide specific details for executing host-to-host FTP and
TELNET connections.


3.2  TAC Access

Military users can access the DDN by connecting to a Terminal Access
Controller, or TAC, and then logging into the TAC by entering a valid Userid
and Access Code (password).  A TAC allows a wide variety of terminals to
communicate directly with any host on the network without going through an
intervening host.  There are three types of TAC-to-terminal connection:  

1.  When a wire or cable runs directly from a terminal to a TAC, it is
    called a hard-wired or direct-connect terminal.

2.  A terminal may also connect to a TAC through a telephone and modem; this
    is called a dial-up connection.

3.  Some terminals are referred to as dedicated terminals.  These terminals
    use a point-to-point modem to connect to the network; they are not
    considered "dial-up" terminals.

After logging into a TAC, you can reach a network host by specifying its host
address.  You may also establish this type of connection on a Mini-TAC (see
Section 4.2.6).

       [NOTE:  You must be a registered, authorized user to obtain a TAC
       Userid and Access Code.  See details in Section 4.1.1.]


3.3  Gateway Access

If a computer is attached to a LAN or a non-DDN network, a gateway or
concentrator manages communication between the local network and the DDN. 
The gateway is transparent--that is, you should be unaware that it is there.
Some sites do not allow traffic to flow from the DDN to their internal
network.  In such cases, the gateway exists and is functional, but you must
use the gateway host itself to perform any tasks that require access to the
DDN (e.g., to establish a TELNET or FTP connection to a DDN host).

NETWORK CONNECTION                                                     Page 11


Electronic mail can travel over this type of gateway transparently. 
Ordinarily, you need no special commands or syntax to communicate through a
gateway.  Figure 2-1 illustrates a gateway connection from a LAN to the DDN,
as well as the other connection strategies discussed in this Section.

       [NOTE:  Because of software limitations, figures are not visible
       in the ASCII format of the online version of this document.]


3.4  A Word About Personal Computers

Although Personal Computers (PCs) can be attached to the DDN in several ways
(including as hosts), at present, most personal computers on the DDN are not
hosts--that is, they have not implemented the network protocols and are not
attached directly to a PSN.  Functioning simply as terminals, they have no
other capabilities so far as the network is concerned.

Like a terminal, a PC can be connected to a host, Terminal Access Controller
(TAC), or Mini-TAC through either a dedicated or a dial-up line.  In these
cases, the PC needs special software that allows it to imitate a terminal.

Once you have assembled the proper equipment, you must configure the software
for your particular system.  You will often need to set the following
parameters:

    speed       The baud rate (in bits per second) at which data is sent
                and received; usually 1200 baud if your connection is
                through a dial-up modem.  However, 9600 baud dial-up
                service is currently being introduced.  For direct lines,
                check with your Node Site Coordinator.

    data bits   Usually set at 8 (or 7 when accessing the network via
                a TAC)

    stop bits   Usually set at 1

    parity      Usually set to "even" or "none"

If these settings do not work, ask local user representatives or host
personnel what your system requires.  Consult the documentation that
accompanies your personal computer, software, and/or modem for details of
operation.

Local site representatives should be the first point of contact for PC-
related problems.  If you have no such representative, contact the Host
Administrator for the host you are trying to reach.  The NIC may also be
able to help with some of the problems you encounter.  Check to see if your
organization has a PC users group, as other users can be a valuable source
of advice.  In addition, the network has several general and machine-specific
PC interest groups that can provide a broad range of information and answers.
(See Appendix A for information on these groups, and see Section 4.2.5 for a
discussion of transferring files through a TAC or Mini-TAC to a PC.)

                     SECTION 4.  DDN TAC ACCESS


This section provides information about TAC cards and explains how to use a
TAC or Mini-TAC to log on to the network and set it to transfer files.  It
also provides information on special settings that may be required to allow
the TAC/Mini-TAC to transfer files and function more efficiently.


4.1  TAC Card Information

The following paragraphs explain how users are registered to receive TAC
cards, what items are printed on a TAC card, and how to get a TAC Users'
Guide.


4.1.1  TAC User Registration

If you are unable to connect directly to your host computer, you will be
issued a TAC Access Card that allows you to access your host via a TAC or
Mini-TAC.  Whether you are located hundreds or thousands of miles away from
the host or right next door, you will need a TAC card only if you cannot
access your host directly.

TAC access requires official authorization from a MILNET Host Administrator,
as well as the assignment of a unique TAC Userid and Access Code (Password).

After obtaining official authorization, the NIC issues each MILNET TAC user a
TAC Access Card containing a Userid and Access Code.  The NIC cannot issue a
card until it has received approval from the Host Administrator for the
user's primary MILNET host (or from the Host Administrator of the gateway
to which his primary host is attached).

      [NOTE:  If you need a TAC card for a limited time, your Host
      Administrator can probably issue you a TAC guest card, which is
      good for up to three months.  If you need such temporary access,
      contact your Host Administrator.]

Regardless of whether you normally use a direct connection to your host, you
may need a TAC Access Card if you travel extensively.  Because TACs and Mini-
TACs are located all over the world, an Access Card allows you to log in
when you are out of town without incurring long distance phone charges.

The TAC Access Card contains a Userid and Access Code.  This Userid and
Access Code are to be used only by the person to whom the card is issued. 
While there is a strict policy of limiting TAC cards to one per person, you
may have many DDN host login accounts, and one TAC card can be used to access
any of these accounts.  You do not need a TAC card from each host on which
you have an account.  Any TAC card works on all TACs.

Note that TAC cards are issued to users by individual name only.  They are
not issued to groups of users or entire offices.  This policy applies even
when many users share a single login account.  Not only is this a security
measure, but it also prevents multiple users from losing DDN access when a
single card is invalidated.

If you are using a card issued to another DDN user, please notify the person
listed as the CONTACT on the card.  This is probably your Host Administrator. 
Inform him/her that you are using an account on his/her host and that you
wish to have a TAC card issued in your own name.

4.1.1.1  Users Behind Concentrators

DDN Management Bulletin 76 [5] states that only administrators of hosts that
are directly connected to the MILNET can authorize TAC or Mini-TAC Access
Cards for their users.  Administrators of hosts that are behind concentrators
or gateways cannot directly authorize their users for TAC access unless they
are delegated that authority by their gateway Host Administrator.  Such
administrators will need either to transfer jurisdiction over their users to
their gateway administrator or to obtain authority from him/her to request
TAC access directly.  If you are a user or Host Administrator who has
questions about this policy, please send a message to

                          REGISTRAR@NIC.DDN.MIL

or call 1-800-365-DNIC for assistance.

If you access the MILNET via a concentrator/gateway, the name of that
concentrator, its address, and its administrator may appear on the HOST,
NETADDRESS, and CONTACT lines of your TAC card.  You may still use your card
to access your primary login account, even if it is on another host; however,
you must know the network address of your primary host.  The administrator of
your primary host can tell you its address.  You must know this address when
you log into a TAC and when you request help with a TAC login problem.


4.1.2  TAC Card Example

Figure 4-1 is a sample of the left portion of a DDN TAC Access Card.  To help
you understand the information on the TAC card, we have identified what each
information item represents.

TAC cards are perforated and include instructions to "detach here" and "fold
here," allowing you to reduce the size of the card so that you may insert it
in a wallet or credit card case.

      WARNING!!  Do not laminate your TAC Card.  Because of NIC printing
      requirements, blank cards are enclosed within carbon-coated
      envelopes.  This carbon material fades very quickly when placed in
      plastic envelopes or when permanently laminated.  This phenomenon
      also extends to the placement of transparent tape over the print. 
      If you wish to preserve or darken the information printed on your
      card, we recommend that you use a ballpoint pen to rewrite it just
      above or below the appropriate item.

The most important information on the right-hand portion of your TAC card is
your mailing address.  However, the NIC includes its toll-free User
Assistance Hotline number on this section of the card in case you lose the
left half.  In addition to the hotline number, the top of the card contains
a brief set of user guidelines.  As an authorized TAC or Mini-TAC user, you
are expected to comply with these guidelines.  If you find yourself in the
position of sharing a TAC Access Card with other users, please notify your
Host Administrator and request a TAC card for each individual.


4.1.2.1  Common TAC Card Userid/Access-Code Input Errors

Just below the guidelines section is a key that shows how each printed
character appears on a TAC card.  The statement, "Access codes never contain
a one, zero, 'Q' or 'Z'" follows.  Remember that these characters are invalid
only in Access Codes and not in Userids.  If you find that the TAC or Mini-
TAC is returning a "Bad Login" error message during your first attempts to
log in, check to see if you are typing one of these invalid characters. 
For example, if you're typing a zero, try the letter O (oscar).  If you're
typing a Q (quebec), try the letter G (golf) instead.  Use the key to compare
the printed characters.  Be aware that other character can also be similar. 
For instance, the 8 (eight) sometimes looks like a B (bravo), and the S
(sierra) sometimes looks like a 5 (five).  TAC card Userids and Access Codes
are not case-sensitive, i.e., you can enter them in either uppercase or
lowercase letters.

If you have any questions about reading or using your TAC access card, call
the NIC for assistance at 1-800-365-DNIC.


4.1.3  Obtaining the TAC Users' Guide

The paragraph in fine print at the bottom of your TAC card alerts you that
further, more comprehensive information is available to you.  Upon written
request, you can obtain the TAC Users' Guide from the Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA).  This document is geared toward users who are
interested in learning some of the finer points of TAC usage.

To order the TAC Users' Guide, send a note specifying its title and DCAC
310-P70-74 to the following address:

4.2  TAC Login Procedures

This section discusses how to use a TAC or Mini-TAC to log in to the DDN. 
It also describes how to connect to a TAC or Mini-TAC, lists some common
TAC/Mini-TAC error messages, and presents information about transferring
files through a TAC to a PC.


4.2.1  Connecting to a TAC or Mini-TAC

The following paragraphs explain the various ways in which you can connect to
a TAC or a Mini-TAC.


4.2.1.1  Dial-up TACs

To connect to a TAC/Mini-TAC using the telephone system, follow the general
procedures described here.  Because the exact steps required to dial the
TAC/Mini-TAC depend on your local hardware setup, check with local site
representatives for details.

You may obtain the number of the nearest TAC/Mini-TAC directly from the
network by using the TACNEWS service (see Section 6.3.3) or by calling the
NIC at 1-800-365-DNIC.  You can look up the phone number of a specific TAC/
Mini- TAC via the NIC WHOIS service (see Section 6.3.1).  In addition, many
TAC/Mini-TAC phone numbers are listed on the back of your TAC Access Card.


4.2.1.2  Using a Terminal with an Acoustic Coupler

To use an acoustic coupler, first dial the TAC/Mini-TAC number on a telephone
and listen for the dial tone.  When you hear the tone, put the telephone
handset into the indicated position on the coupler cuffs.


4.2.1.3  Using a Dial-up Modem

A dial-up modem will be wired to your telephone and to your terminal. 
(Consult the instructions that come with the modem to attach it to your
terminal and set it properly.)  Begin by dialling the TAC/Mini-TAC number on
the telephone.  Then, wait for the tone, switch the modem from "voice" to
"data," and set the handset back on the telephone cradle.  Note that the
speed of the terminal must match the speed of the modem.  Also note that some
modems are "smart"--that is, you will not have to use the telephone to dial
the number.  Instead, you will type some instructions to your terminal, such
as "DIAL5551212" or "ATDT9,18003682227."  The modem will then dial the number
as instructed and make the connection for you.  See your modem instruction
manual for exact details.


4.2.1.4  Using a PC and Communications Software

To access a TAC/Mini-TAC, you can use one of the popular communications
software packages such as Procomm or the Xmodem protocol.  These programs
often enable the PC to dial the TAC/Mini-TAC, open the host connection, and
enter your Userid and Access Code automatically.  If you use such a package,
be sure you know how to dial the TAC/Mini-TAC by hand in case there are
problems with the script or the equipment.  It is also useful to know the
address of the host you connect to and how to alter the script when changes
are made to the network.  



NIC 60001, February 1993
DDN TAC ACCESS                                                        Page 16


Finally, for security reasons, you should enter your Userid and Access Code
manually when logging in rather than including this information within the
access script.


4.2.1.5  Hard-Wired TAC Connections

If you are to connect to a host via a hard-wired TAC connection, you will
need to consult a local user representative or Node Site Coordinator to learn
the procedure for getting to the TAC/Mini-TAC.  The procedure will vary
depending upon what equipment is used and how it is configured at your
location.


4.2.2  TAC Login

After you have successfully connected to a TAC/Mini-TAC, you must supply a
"wake-up" character to alert the TAC to your presence.  Do this by holding
down the <Control> key and typing the letter Q on your keyboard (^Q).  The
TAC/Mini-TAC should respond with a banner--often a message from the MILNET
Monitoring Center.  If you are dialing into a TAC modem capable of 9600 bps,
enter a <Return> character instead of a ^Q.  If you are unsure of the modem
type at the TAC, try both characters.

Once the TAC banner is displayed on your screen, you can begin the process of
logging into the TAC/Mini-TAC and connecting to a remote host.

On the following page is a sample scenario showing how to log in to a
TAC/Mini-TAC.

For more detailed instructions on using a TAC/Mini-TAC and setting terminal
parameters, consult the TAC Users' Guide [1].

When you enter your TAC Userid and Access Code, remember the following:

    *  <Return> terminates each input line and causes the next prompt to
       appear.

    *  It doesn't matter whether you type your TAC Userid and Access Code
       in uppercase or lowercase letters.

    *  For security reasons, your Access Code input is not echoed or it is
       obscured from view with strikeover characters.

    *  If you make a mistake, try using the backspace key (^H) to delete a
       single character.  Use ^U to delete an entire line.  Although
       these commands do not work on every keyboard, they often do.

    *  If you make a mistake while entering either your TAC Userid or
       Access Code, type ^C to abort the login process and return to
       the TAC command mode.  Then try again.

    *  Sometimes the TAC/Mini-TAC is unable to reach the requested host
       address.  To tell the TAC/Mini-TAC to stop making connection
       attempts, issue a close command:

                          @c <Return>      
                          Closed.          

    *  As long as you have an open connection to a host, you remain logged
       in to the TAC/Mini-TAC.  If you close the connection to the host
       or the connection is shut down for any reason, you are given ten
       minutes to open another connection with no further login to the
       TAC/Mini-TAC.  If you do not open another connection within ten
       minutes, the TAC attempts to hang up your connection and
       automatically log you out. 

       To open another connection, simply type the "open" command again and
       supply another host address,  as in the example below:

                         @o 128.1.0.1 <Return>


4.2.3  Common TAC Login Problems

This section covers only TAC login problems.  Problems specific to the Mini-
TAC will be covered in a future revision of this document.

The TAC issues an error message when it does not receive the expected input. 
Some of the most common error messages are presented in this section, along
with suggestions about what to do if you see one.

The TAC sends two kinds of messages.  The first deals with errors in the TAC
login process; the second deals with difficulties in opening a connection to
the destination host.





NIC 60001, February 1993

4.2.3.1  TAC Login Error Messages

You may see one of the following error messages if you have problems logging
in to a TAC.  Each message is accompanied by a brief explanation of its cause
and suggestions for further action.


BAD LOGIN
    This message means that the combination of Userid and Access Code you
    entered is invalid.  Examine your TAC Access Card carefully to be sure
    you are typing the correct characters and that you are not using any of
    the characters that are invalid in an Access Code.  Note that Access
    Codes never contain a zero (0), a one (1), a Q (quebec), or a Z (zulu),
    since each of these characters may easily be mistaken for another.  If
    your Access Code appears to contain one of these characters, it may be
    the letter O (oscar), the letter L (lima), the letter G (golf), or the
    number 2 (two).

    This message is also displayed if you are using an expired or invalid
    TAC card.  If you are sure you are typing correctly and suspect you are
    using a bad card, contact the NIC at 1-800-365-DNIC, and they can
    determine the validity of your card.


BAD
    This message means you typed a string that is not a valid TAC command,
    and the TAC does not understand your input.  Either you typed something
    incorrectly or there was some interference on your connection. 
    Frequently, simply repeating the command corrects the problem.  However,
    if repeating your input causes another error message, check to make sure
    that you understand the command you meant to type and that your input is
    in an acceptable format.


NUM
    This message means that the TAC was expecting you to type a number, but
    you typed some other character.  The message is displayed if you type
    the letter O (oscar) as part of the address of the host you are trying
    to connect to, or if you omit the numeric host address after typing @o
    (for open).  Make sure that you are not typing letters in places you
    should be typing numbers; this will probably correct the problem.


WAIT
    The TAC displays this message while it is attempting to validate your
    Userid and Access Code.


NO CARRIER
    This message comes from your PC or modem.  If this message is displayed
    on your initial attempt to dial the TAC/Mini-TAC, it means that the
    TAC/Mini-TAC did not answer the phone.  This could be because of a power
    failure or other emergency at the site where the TAC/Mini-TAC is
    located, or it could be the result of a mis-dialed telephone number. 
    Try calling the number with a telephone that is not connected to your
    terminal and see if your get a busy signal or other recording from the
    telephone company.

    If this message appears after you have logged in and while you are
    working on the host, it means that something happened to disconnect your
    modem from the TAC/Mini-TAC.  Try dialing the TAC/Mini-TAC again.  If

    the problem persists, contact your site systems representative to check
    your modem, or call the Monitoring Center for your area to check the
    TAC/Mini-TAC.

4.2.3.2  Host Connection Errors

Host connection error messages are sent when you have successfully logged in
to the TAC and while the TAC is trying to connect to the host you specified. 
You know that you have successfully logged in to the TAC when you see the
"Login OK, TCP trying..." message.


DESTINATION HOST DEAD
    This message means that the remote host is physically powered off or the
    cable to the network has been removed.  The host is "down."  Since host
    down-times are normally relatively short, wait a while and try to log in
    again.  If the host remains unavailable, call the Host Administrator for
    the destination host and ask when the system will be available again. 
    If you do not know the Host Administrator's phone number, the NIC can
    provide it or the name and number of the coordinator of the network to
    which the host is attached.  This information can also be found by
    querying the NIC's WHOIS database.


DESTINATION HOST UNREACHABLE
DESTINATION NET UNREACHABLE
HOST NOT RESPONDING
    Several network conditions can cause these messages.  They may be
    displayed if the host or its PSN is down or if a gateway between the TAC
    and the host is down.  Also, check to ensure that you specified the
    correct host address.  Typing a nonexistent network address will cause
    such a message to be generated.  If the condition persists, call the NIC
    for assistance.


4.2.4  Changing the TAC Intercept Character

The "@" sign is the default TAC intercept character.  The intercept character
is the character that signals the TAC to interpret any character(s) that
follow immediately as TAC commands rather than passing them through to the

network.

However, once you have connected to your host, you may want to send an @
directly through to the network--for example, when you type a DDN mail
address. 

To make the TAC pass the @ on to the host rather than intercepting it, you
must type @ twice--i.e., @@.  When you do this, the TAC intercepts the first
"@", transmits the second "@" to the host, and echoes that one back to you. 
You will see @@@ on your screen.  Remember, when you want to type an "@" for
anything other than a TAC command, you must type it twice.  For example, to
send a message to auser@milhost, you would have to type

    auser@@milhost      

and on your screen you would see

     auser@@@milhost

To change the TAC intercept character, you must type @i (for intercept)
followed by the decimal value of the ASCII code of the character you wish to
use in place of the @.  The TAC Users' Guide contains a list of ASCII codes. 

For purposes of text file transfers, we recommend that you change the
intercept to a non-printing character, such as a control character.  For
example, to change the intercept character to control-y (^y), type the
following:

    @i 25 <Return>      

(Be sure to insert a space between the @i and the ASCII code number.)  After
you change the intercept character, you must use the new character for all
subsequent TAC commands.  To return to the default TAC intercept character
(the "@" sign) after changing it to ^y, type the following:

    ^yi e <Return>      

where "i e" stands for intercept escape.


4.2.5  Using a TAC for File Transfer

This section presents several TAC command procedures that may facilitate file
transfers through a TAC.  The procedures covered here are 

    *  Changing the TAC intercept character,
    *  Setting flow control on the TAC,
    *  Putting the TAC into binary mode.


4.2.5.1  Changing the Intercept Character

For executing file transfers, you may want to change the TAC intercept
character to one that your file transfer program does not use.  For example,
the Kermit file transfer program uses the "@" (discussed in a subsequent
section).  To change the intercept character, follow the directions in
Section 4.2.4 above.


4.2.5.2  Setting Flow Control on the TAC

Setting flow control on the TAC ensures that data will not be transferred at
a rate that causes the TAC buffers to overflow.  The example below assumes
that you have changed the TAC intercept character to ^y.  (The ^y characters
are shown in the examples, but they will not display on your screen as you
type them on your keyboard.)

    ^yd c a <Return>      
    ^yf i s <Return>      
    ^yf o s <Return>      

where

    ^yd c a          =   device code ASCII, which clears any previously
                         set flow control as well as any padding and
                         parity.  Flow control is incompatible with
                         padding and parity.




NIC 60001, February 1993
DDN TAC ACCESS                                                        Page 22


    ^yf i s          =   flow control input start, which enables flow
                         control so that the terminal sending data will
                         not send it faster than the TAC can handle it.

    ^yf o s          =   flow control output start, which disables flow
                         control from the TAC to the terminal.


4.2.5.3  Putting the TAC in Binary Mode

To transfer binary files over the network, you must first put the TAC into
binary mode.  Doing so disables the TAC intercept character.  You must disable
the intercept character because if the TAC receives what it considers to be 
an intercept character--even though the character is embedded in a file--it
interrupts the transfer process and tries to interpret whatever follows the
intercept as a command.

To put the TAC in binary mode, first open a connection to your host.  After
establishing the host connection, put the TAC in binary mode with the
commands shown below.  (Here again, the example assumes you have changed the
intercept character to ^y.)  The commands must be typed in the order shown,
because if you start binary input before you initiate binary output, the TAC
will ignore the "^yb o s command" and treat it simply as a character string
to transmit over the network.

    ^yb o s <Return>      
    ^yb i s <Return>     

where

    ^yb o s          =   binary output start, which enables 8-bit binary
                         output mode from the TAC.

    ^yb i s          =   binary input start, which enables 8-bit binary
                         input mode to the TAC.

Logging out of your host returns the TAC to non-binary mode, re-enabling local
control with @ commands.  This is the only way to reset the TAC from binary to
non-binary mode (short of hanging up or disconnecting from the TAC itself).


4.2.6  A Brief Word About Mini-TACs

Mini-TACS are new and improved DDN access controllers similar to the TACs
currently in use.  As with the original TACs, Mini-TACs provide DDN access to
network users who are geographically distant from their host computers.  When
a user dials a local or toll-free phone number and types the required series
of commands, it opens a long-distance connection to the user's host computer.

TACs support up to 63 asynchronous user ports.  The smaller, more compact
Mini-TAC can handle only 16 asynchronous terminal connections, but it has
other capabilities (i.e., synchronous terminals, HFEP, etc.).  Both TACs and
Mini-TACs allow normally incompatible terminals and hosts to communicate with
one another using the DDN as the go-between.  While both types of access
controllers serve similar roles, the Mini-TACs provide more advanced
operational and security features.

DDN TAC ACCESS                                                        Page 23


Like a TAC, the Mini-TAC returns error messages to its users if it cannot
understand a command.  Currently, from a user standpoint, the Mini-TACs and
the TACs are essentially the same.  If you notice any difference in behavior
between TACs and Mini-TACs and you need assistance, call the MILNET Monitoring
Center or the NIC.  At present, some TAC commands can be abbreviated to one
character.  However, in the future, Mini-TAC commands may need to be a least
two characters long to ensure that they are differentiated from other
commands starting with the same letters.

                       SECTION 5.  NETWORK USE


A computer attached to the DDN can reach a large community of users and
access a wide variety of software.  Research tools, documents, files, and
mailing lists are all readily accessible through the DDN.  This section
describes the procedures for using these network tools, three of which are
major network services: electronic mail, file transfer (FTP), and remote
login (TELNET). These services are integral to the DDN protocols and are
offered by all hosts that have implemented the full set of network protocols.

Although the functionality of the services discussed here is the same on
every host, what the user sees may differ from host to host because software
is often customized to suit the host operating system.  For this reason, it
is important to read local online and hard-copy documentation and to consult
online help files for specific details on using these services on your host. 
Check with your local Host Administrator or site systems representative if
you need more information.  The sections below provide generic instructions
for using electronic mail, FTP, and TELNET.



5.1  Electronic Mail

The DDN capability that is used more often than any other is electronic mail. 
Electronic mail lets users send messages to one another over the network. 
System programs accept and store mail messages from users on other hosts that
are directed to local users.  These programs automatically recognize the
incoming traffic as electronic mail, translate it to a format compatible with
the receiving mail program, and direct the messages to the correct recipients.

Most users have an online mail file where all messages addressed to them are
stored.

You can print, read, or delete your mail using the local mail program. 
However, you should not edit or alter the structure of your mail file except
through a mail program, as each message has unique characteristics that
identify it as mail, such as a header, a character count, and a time stamp. 
Editing the mail file directly may alter these characteristics so that the
mail program no longer recognizes the data as mail.

Host computers usually provide one or more programs for reading and sending
mail.  Most mail programs provide you with the following capabilities:

   *   Reading messages

       All mail programs have a command that allows you to read messages
       received over the network.  Mail programs normally offer options
       for selecting and displaying specific messages from those received
       and stored in your mailbox.


   *   Printing, deleting, or moving messages

       With your local mail program, you can print your messages (if a
       printer is available), move them into other (editable) files, or
       delete them.  It is important that you learn how to delete or move
       messages after reading them; otherwise, your mail file may
       overflow and prevent additional mail from being delivered.




NIC 60001, February 1993
NETWORK USE                                                            Page 25


   *   Sending messages

       You can send messages to other users on your own host or to anyone
       on the network that has a mail service.  No passwords are required
       to send mail, but you must know the network mailbox, or address,
       of the person to whom you are sending mail.  Network mailboxes
       usually take the form

             USERNAME@HOSTNAME.DOMAIN

             e.g., SMITH@NIC.DDN.MIL.

Mail that is transmitted over the DDN normally requires a network address made
up of a username and a hostname.  Occasionally, you can omit the hostname. 
For example, if you are sending a message to a user on the same host as the
one you are using (your local host), you need not include the hostname.  This
is similar to sending an interoffice memo, which rarely needs a full name and
address to reach its destination.  On the other hand, a message sent to "John
Smith, U.S.A" has little chance of being delivered without more information. 
The same is true of electronic messages without a valid address.  Any message
with an incomplete or incorrect address is returned to the sender with an
error message.

If a mail message is undeliverable due to network or machine problems, most
mail programs try to resend it several times before returning it to the
sender.

Many mail programs allow you to use a local text editor to revise or correct
the text of the message you are preparing.  The mail programs themselves
usually have simple editing features that allow you to delete a character,
word, or line, or to make simple corrections.  An entire file may be sent as
the text of a message, assuming the file is not too large.  Many mailers
outside the DDN truncate or discard messages that are longer than 50,000
characters in size, envelope and header data included.  It is usually safer
to limit the size of your messages to ensure reliable delivery.

Following are examples of some typical procedures for sending and reading
mail and for getting help within a network mail program.  These are general
scenarios; your host may run a different program or implementation than the
ones shown.  Only the bare essentials for using these mail programs are
included here.  We urge you to read the manuals for your mail system and to
explore the online help facilities to expand your knowledge of what your
implementation has to offer.

In the examples that follow, note that the prompt character consistently
indicates what operating system or program you are dealing with currently,
and that the prompt character changes as you progress from one program to
another.

      NOTE:  Computer names, user names, electronic addresses, and
      other data used in examples throughout this manual are not
      intended to represent currently valid input/output--i.e., some of
      the data may be "ficticious" but the format is accurate.

5.2  File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

FTP is a protocol that enables you to move a file from one computer to
another--even if the computers have different operating systems and file
storage formats.  You can move data files, programs, text files, and/or
anything that can be stored online.




NIC 60001, February 1993
NETWORK USE                                                           Page 29


To use FTP, you must know the hostname or the network address of the remote
host.  You must also have an authorized username and password on the remote
host system, and you must know the name of the file you want to retrieve from
or send to that system.  You can then copy files either to or from the remote
system.  Not every file, however, can be FTP'd.  Only those files that have
public "read access" (i.e., a file protection designation that permits
transfers) can be transferred from one system to another.

Some hosts provide the username "anonymous" for FTP file retrieval from their
systems; this is called the "anonymous login convention."  Any character
string is accepted as a password for an anonymous login.  An anonymous login
account works only with FTP.  It is not an account that can be accessed for
general use.  Normally, you cannot use the anonymous convention to send files
to a remote host, as this requires a specific login account on that host;
you may only use it to transfer files to your local workspace from a host on
which you do not have a login account.  However, some hosts now provide
public directories where you can send files as well as retrieve them.

These are the general steps used for a file transfer procedure:

   1.  Log in to your local host and invoke the FTP program.

   2.  Provide the hostname or network address for the remote system.

   3.  When you have successfully established a connection to the remote
       host, log in with your authorized username and password on that
       system.

   4.  Issue commands to send or retrieve files.

   5.  When you are finished, log off the remote host and exit from the
       FTP program.

Depending on the FTP implementations on your host and on the remote host, it
may be possible to display a directory listing of the public files on the
remote host and to request remote system status information. 

As you will see from the examples, when you transfer a file with FTP, messages
regarding the status of the action you have requested are displayed throughout
the process.  The FTP server on the remote host sends the File Transfer
messages.  These messages generally have the following characteristics: 

   *   Every FTP command generates at least one reply.  

   *   A reply consists of a three-digit return code, followed by a
       line of text describing the response.  

   *   If a single line of text accompanies the return code, a
       single space separates the code from the text.  

   *   If more than one line accompanies the return code, a hyphen
       (-) separates the code from the text.  

During a File Transfer session, you enter a command and then wait for a
message indicating whether the command was accepted.  Further system messages
describe the outcome of any transfer you may request.

The text that accompanies the FTP return codes may differ slightly from server
to server, but the general meaning of the numeric codes remains constant.

NETWORK USE                                                            Page 30


Programs based on the FTP protocol vary a great deal in implementation
details.  The examples provided here should be taken only as guidelines. 
Consult your local system representatives for assistance with the FTP
implementation on your host.

Before you begin a File Transfer session, it is best to become familiar with
the general command sequence. 

An example of an FTP session conducted between two UNIX systems appears below.
In the example, a user carries out several standard FTP procedures, such as
asking for a directory listing of the public files on the remote system and
then changing to another directory.  Remember that the commands to accomplish
these tasks may vary from host to host, and not all host FTP servers implement
all commands.

5.2.2  How to FTP a Directory Listing

The example that follows demonstrates how to retrieve a list of file names
from a public directory.  (Not all hosts provide this feature; check with
the online help system or your local user support representative.)  In the
example, the user is logged on to a host running the UNIX operating system. 
He uses FTP to connect to the host NIC.DDN.MIL, then logs in under username
"anonymous" and password "guest."  He enters the "dir" (directory) command
for the directory "RFC" to see the names of accessible files.  (Because the
actual directory list is long, only the first few files and the last file
are shown in the example.)

After the directory listing is displayed, the user can copy a file or files
from the remote host directory, but this procedure is not included in the
example.  He issues the FTP command "bye" to exit from the program and close
the connection to the remote host, which returns him to the local host
operating system.

5.3  Using TELNET

Another valuable way to use the network is offered by the TELNET utility,
which allows you to log in to a remote host from a local host (assuming that
you have an authorized account on the remote host).  Once you have established
a TELNET connection and logged into the remote host, you can enter data, run
programs, and otherwise operate just as though you were logged in directly. 
During a TELNET session, each transition to a different interactive program
causes a shift to a different command level.  With each level, the form of
the prompt varies.  Command formats also vary with each level.  You can often
tell which system/program you are using by the prompt symbol.  The steps for
running TELNET, very briefly summarized, are as follows:

   *   Log in to your local host.

   *   Invoke the TELNET program from that host.

   *   Identify by hostname or network address the remote host that you
       want access to.

   *   When the TELNET connection is established, log in to the remote
       host with the username and password that have been assigned to you
       on that host.

   *   Perform whatever tasks you like on the remote machine, being
       careful not to violate any remote operating system rules.

   *   When finished working on the remote host, type the remote logout
       command.  Then close the TELNET connection--if it is not
       automatically closed on logout.

   *   You are once again operating in your local host system environment.

TELNET has other advanced features too numerous to discuss here.  Check you
local TELNET user program for online documentation, or talk to your local
Host Administrator or user support representative for more information.


5.3.1  Invoking TELNET with the Hostname on the Command Line

In the following example, a user TELNETs from a local UNIX host to a remote
SunOS host.  Once the connection has been established, the prompts, commands,
and responses are those of the Sun Operating System environment.  To the user,
it appears as though he/she were directly logged in to the remote computer.

After the user is done working on the remote host, he issues the remote
system's logout command.  This logout automatically returns him to the TELNET
program on the local host, closes the TELNET session, and returns the local
operating system prompt (%).

Note that instead of invoking the TELNET program and then issuing an "open"
command to the remote host at a TELNET prompt, the user supplies the remote
hostname directly on the program invocation line.  (Not all implementations
recognize this form of connection.)  In addition, note that the user would
need an authorized account on the NIC host to log in with username and
password as shown in the example.

****************************************************************************

  % telnet gsimail.ddn.mil <Return>        User issues the telnet command,
                                           giving the remote hostname as
                                           an argument on the command line.

  System 5 UNIX (gsimail)                 TELNET prints messages during

                                          the connection, and notifies the
                                          user of the escape character (see
                                          discussion of escape charaters in

  Connection closed by remote host.

****************************************************************************


5.3.2  TELNET Using Host Address

Instead of invoking TELNET and specifying a hostname for the remote host,
you may specify the remote address in dot notation format.  Some hosts
require the network address to be enclosed in brackets if it is supplied on
the command line.  (Many TELNET implementation prompt for a network hostname
or address if you do not specify one, and they may allow you to open the
connection after asking for help or issuing other TELNET commands.)  To
establish a TELNET connection using a host address, proceed as shown in the
example that follows.

The example presumes a user on a UNIX host connecting to the NIC's SunOS
system via TELNET.   After reaching the NIC host, the user looks up a name
with the WHOIS program, exits from WHOIS, and then closes the connection.

NIC 60001, February 1993
THE DDN NIC                                                            Page 35



           SECTION 6.  DDN NETWORK INFORMATION CENTER (NIC)


The DDN Network Information Center (NIC) is located at the DDN Installation
and Information Services (DIIS) program office in Chantilly, Virginia.  The
NIC is funded by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense
Network Systems Organization (DNSO).  The NIC is responsible for providing
general reference services to DDN users via telephone, electronic mail, and
U.S. mail.  The NIC also provides databases and information services of
interest to network users, including the WHOIS registry of network users and
other network entities, the NIC/Query browsing system, TACNEWS, and the
official DoD Host Name Service.  The NIC maintains the RFC (Request for
Comments) collection on-line.  Many other online informational files are also
available through the NIC's automatic mail service, SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL.

Among its other duties, the NIC 

    *  registers hosts and domains,
    *  assigns IP network numbers and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs),
    *  provides hostname translation tables and domain name system server
       files to the DDN and the Internet,
    *  registers network users,
    *  issues MILNET TAC Access Cards.

6.1.4  NIC U.S. Mail Address

The NIC's current mailing address is

                 Network Information Center
                 14200 Park Meadow Drive, Suite 200
                 Chantilly, VA 22021-2219


6.2  NIC Services

In addition to the user assistance Help Desk described in Section 6.1.1, the
NIC provides registration, billing, and security support services.


6.2.1  Network and User Registration Services

The NIC registers the following network entities:

    *  domains 
    *  IP network numbers
    *  inverse addressing data
    *  Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs)
    *  hosts
    *  TACs/Mini-TACs
    *  gateways and PSNs
    *  some network-related organizations.

Registration of MILNET hosts, TACs, gateways, and PSNs is coordinated with the
MILNET Manager.  If you wish to register an IP network, domain, or ASN,
contact the NIC Help Desk for information regarding procedures.  New users
seldom need to register these entities.

Each individual who has TAC access to the DDN must be registered in the NIC
WHOIS database.  Host Administrators register individuals in the database as
part of the process of authorizing TAC cards for them.  You will find it
useful to be registered in this database because it serves as an electronic
white pages for DDN users.  Non-military Internet Points of Contact are often
listed there as well.



NIC 60001, February 1993

To be registered in the NIC WHOIS database, you will need to fill out a copy
of the NIC registration template (Figure 6-1) and send it to the network
mailbox REGISTRAR@NIC.DDN.MIL.  You may obtain this template via file transfer
(FTP) from the NIC.DDN.MIL machine (192.112.36.5 is the numeric host address)
using the pathname netinfo/user-template.txt or templates/user-template.txt--
or you may reproduce the template yourself if you adhere strictly to the
format of the online file.  Detailed instructions for filling out the
template are included in the file.  The format of the template may change as
DISA dictates, but the latest approved version will be maintained online at
the NIC.

(Instructions for using FTP to copy/retrieve a file are presented in Section
5.1.2, or you may consult your local FTP documentation.)

6.2.2  Usage-Sensitive Billing Service Desk

Since the advent of usage-sensitive billing on the DDN, the NIC has provided a
service to answer queries regarding DDN billing.  This support is provided
primarily for POCs who receive the bills and have questions about them.  If



NIC 60001, February 1993
THE DDN NIC                                                            Page 38


you have received a bill for DDN usage and have any questions about it, you
can contact the NIC Help Desk as described in Section 6.1.1 or send a message
to BILLING@NIC.DDN.MIL.


6.2.3  Security Coordination Center (SCC)

The NIC is the site of the DDN Security Coordination Center (SCC).  The SCC
acts in conjunction with the DDN Network Security Officer (NSO) to coordinate
actions related to security incidents and network vulnerabilities.  The SCC
relays security-related information to the Network Security Officer (NSO) and
works with him/her in handling network security problems.  In addition, the
SCC issues DDN Security Bulletins to network users.  You can contact the SCC
in the following ways:

    By Electronic Mail:             SCC@NIC.DDN.MIL
    By Phone:                       1-800-365-DNIC (continental U.S.)

                                    Chantilly, VA  22021-2219

Phone hours are from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Eastern Standard or Eastern Daylight
Time.


6.3  NIC User Programs

The NIC offers several online programs that DDN users may access to retrieve
various kinds of information.  The WHOIS, TACNEWS, NIC/Query, and SERVICE
programs and procedures for using them are described in this section.  The
NIC's Kermit server is also described.


6.3.1  WHOIS

WHOIS is the NIC program that looks up information in an electronic "white
pages" directory of network users.  You can also obtain information on hosts,
gateways, TACs, domains, and other network entities from WHOIS.  WHOIS lists
the name, network mailbox, U.S. mail address, telephone number, host, and TAC
user status, where applicable, for each user registered in its database.  For
other entities, it provides such information as domain names, a list of domain
servers, domain contacts, network numbers, network contacts, known hosts on a
given network or gateway, Host Administrators, and Node Site Coordinators. 
Phone numbers and network mailbox addresses are provided for all those who
serve as Points of Contact (POCs).


6.3.1.1  Accessing WHOIS

Here are some instructions for accessing the WHOIS program from different
points of origin:

>From a TAC

    *  Type @n.

    *  After being greeted by the TAC banner, press <Return> and enter
       your TAC userid and TAC Access Code when prompted.

    *  After the NIC host banner and greeting are displayed, type whois
       <Return>.


>From a DDN Host

    *  Log onto your local host and TELNET to the NIC, e.g.,

                 telnet nic.ddn.mil <Return>     
        or
                 telnet 192.112.36.5 <Return>    

    *  After the NIC host banner and greeting is displayed, type whois
       <Return>.


Via Electronic Mail

    *  From your login host, invoke the mail program and send a message
       to 

                 SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL

    *  As the subject of the message (i.e., on the "Subject:" line),
       enter WHOIS and the string you want the program to search on--
       e.g., 

                 Subject: whois nic.ddn.mil

       Any valid WHOIS search input string can be sent to the SERVICE
       program.  However, if the response is large, it will be split into
       several return messages.  If it is very, very large, it may exceed
       the capacity of the Mail server, but most search outputs are well
       within its limits.

You may also run the WHOIS program from a local host if you have one of the
several WHOIS user programs that are available for various operating systems. 
Contact the NIC if you are interested in obtaining such a program.


6.3.1.2  Using WHOIS 

To use WHOIS, you can supply either the name or the NIC "handle" of the person
or entity you are trying to identify.  The handle is a unique identifier that
the NIC assigns to each entity registered in its database.  Partial searches
on the first part of a name are also possible.

The WHOIS program accessible on the NIC host also recognizes certain keywords.

They tell WHOIS to limit its search to certain kinds of records--such as host
records only, or domain records only.  If you search with a keyword, you must
insert the keyword in the search string before the entity for which you want
information.   Such keywords can increase the speed of a search.  Some of the
keywords that the NIC host's WHOIS program recognizes are as follows:



NIC 60001, February 1993
THE DDN NIC                                                            Page 40


             DOM       for domain records
             GA        for gateway records
             HO        for host records
             NET       for network records
             PSN       for PSN records
             TAC       for TAC records.

WHOIS is not case sensitive.  Some of the examples that follow use keywords
and some do not.  Those that do use keywords assume that you have used TELNET
to connect to the NIC.DDN.MIL for access to their WHOIS program.  For a
complete list of keywords and examples of how to use them, simply type help
or a question mark (?) at the WHOIS prompt, e.g.,

           Whois: help <Return>     

WHOIS responds to your query in one of three ways:

    1.  If WHOIS finds a unique record for the individual/entity you have
        identified as the subject of the search, it immediately displays
        the following information:

        *   the name
        *   the NIC handle
        *   the organization (if applicable)
        *   the mailing address
        *   the phone number
        *   the network mailbox.

    2.  If WHOIS finds several records that match the search input, it
        displays a brief list of the matching entries and asks you to
        choose the correct match by using the handle (a unique character
        string in parentheses following the name).  A search by handle
        produces the expanded output for the matching entity.

    3.  If no record matches the search input, WHOIS displays the message
        "No match for <search-string>," where <search-string> is the
        character sequence you entered.

The following examples illustrate some of the WHOIS capabilities.  For more
information on using WHOIS, connect to the NIC host and type whois help.


6.3.1.3  WHOIS Search Examples

       NOTE:  Names, addresses, phone numbers, and other information
       shown in the following examples are meant to be representative
       only!  They are not necessarily actual or accurate data and should
       not be used for contacting any of the entities/persons identified!

                     WHOIS Search by Partial Name

You may search using only a partial name as the search string by entering the
partial name followed by one to three dots (...).  This search feature will
work only if the dots follow the partial name without any intervening spaces. 
This kind of search is apt to produce multiple "hits" (hits are entries that
match a given search string).

Note that the partial name search also finds any NIC handles that begin with
the partial name input ("ros" in the example that follows).

To obtain all the information pertaining to any of these names, do a WHOIS
search on the handle (the text in parentheses immediately following the name).
This will produce a full entry.

If a WHOIS search produces multiple hits on your query, search by the unique
handle to get the full entry of the hit you want to display.  Precede the
handle with an exclamation point.  Users on hosts running a UNIX operating
system may need to precede the exclamation point with a backslash (\).

6.3.3  NIC Kermit Server

For PC users who cannot access FTP from their hosts, the NIC has an anonymous
Kermit server available.  (A server is a software module that provides a
service to users or user programs that request it.)  You should be familiar
with the Kermit file transfer protocol and have a PC communications program
that supports that protocol Before you attempt to transfer documents with it.

To download a file from the NIC using the Kermit server, proceed as follows:

    1.  Set the receive packet size on your PC Kermit to 60.

    2.  Connect to NIC.DDN.MIL (192.112.36.5) through a TAC or Mini-TAC.

    3.  Once you get the NIC login prompt (@), change the TAC intercept
        character to a control-y (^y)  by issuing the following TAC command: 
        @i 25 <Return>.  Notice that you must type the "@" symbol because it
        signals the TAC that you are issuing a command.

    4.  Press <Return> to get the NIC prompt (@ is now the NIC prompt
        symbol), then type Kermit<Return>.  This command activates the Kermit
        server on the NIC.

    5.  Drop back to your PC Kermit and get the file that you want from the
        NIC.

    6.  When you are finished, type "bye" to end the Kermit session on your
        PC.

For more information on using Kermit through a TAC, see the files
KERMIT-TAC-INFO.TXT and KERMIT-NICSERVER.TXT in the netinfo/ directory on the
NIC.DDN.MIL host.  These files are available via the SERVICE mail server (see
Section 6.3.5).


6.3.4  NIC Automated Mail Service

SERVICE is an automated electronic mail system provided by the DDN Network
Information Center.  It allows access to most online NIC documents and
information via electronic mail.

To use the mail service, send a message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL.  In the
SUBJECT field, enter the type of service you are requesting, followed by any
arguments needed to further define your request.  The message body is
normally ignored; however, if you leave the SUBJECT field empty, the first
line of the message body is used as the request.  If your request involves
the transmission of large files, they are broken into smaller, separate
messages; however, a few files are too large to be sent through the mail
system.  SERVICE requests are processed automatically once a day.

The following services are currently available.  Each item on the list is
followed by an example of a subject line for requesting that service:

    HELP               This message; a list of current services.
                       Subj:  HELP

        SECTION 7.  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS AND NETWORK CONDUCT


7.1  Requirements for Legitimate DDN Access

Only authorized users engaged in U.S. Government business or applicable
research or those who are directly involved in providing operations or system
support for Government-owned or Government-sponsored computer communications
equipment may use the DDN.  The network is not available for use by the
general public, nor is it intended to compete with comparable commercial
network services.  Users of the DDN must not violate privacy or other
applicable laws and should not use the networks for advertising or recruiting
purposes without the express permission of the Defense Information Systems
Agency.

Unauthorized use of the DDN is illegal.  Persons who break into Government
networks or use Government computer resources without authorization will be
prosecuted.  Hosts that permit this type of access will be disconnected from
the network.

       [NOTE:  DISA reserves the right to discontinue DDN access to any
       user(s) who are, in DISA's opinion, not conducting legitimate
       Government business/activity.  DISA will send one letter of
       warning through command channels (via registered mail) to any user
       found to be conducting illegitimate business.  Should the
       illegitimate activity continue, DISA will terminate the user's
       access without additional notice.]



7.2  Security Considerations and Guidelines for Network Conduct

Several levels of responsibility provide security for the DDN.  At the most
basic level, individual users should take precautions to minimize the chances
that their accounts could be compromised.  They bear the primary
responsibility for the protection of their information.  If more users were
to take this responsibility seriously and act accordingly, the majority of
computer security breaches would not occur.

You can best protect your own files via careful password management.  Do not
use an unmodified word from any language; this includes words spelled
backward.  Your Host Administrator should have suggestions as to proper
password choices.

Follow these recommendations to reduce the possibility of compromise of your
computer system or files:

    *  Do not leave your terminal logged in and unattended.

    *  Know your operating system's protection mechanisms and make sure
       that all your files are set up with appropriate protection modes.

    *  Choose a password that meets the guidelines of your site or, at
       minimum, one that is not an unmodified word from any language.  A
       simple modification involves prefixing a word with a numeral (or
       several numerals).

    *  Change your password as required by your site or, at minimum,
       every six months.




NIC 60001, February 1993
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS AND NETWORK CONDUCT                            Page 54


    *  Do not write your password down on paper or record it in a file
       stored on any computer disk, floppy disk, PC, or magnetic tape.

Users have the primary responsibility for protecting their own accounts, but
several other people have roles in providing system and network security.

Host Administrators are generally responsible for ensuring that their host
sites maintain a reasonable level of protection from the possibility of
network compromise.  They must act as liaisons with the DDN Network Security
Officer (DDN NSO), the Security Coordination Center (SCC), vendors, law
enforcement bodies, and other appropriate agencies to resolve any outstanding
security problems and prevent their recurrence.  They are responsible for the
enforcement of all DDN policies at their site.

The NSO recommends security policy affecting the DDN and is responsible for
its general enforcement.  The NSO also works closely with Host Administrators
to resolve network and related computer security problems or incidents
affecting their sites.

The DDN Security Coordination Center is located at the NIC.  The SCC acts as
a liaison between Host Administrators and the NSO and between MILNET sites and
Internet security response centers such as the Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT).

If you suspect that a computer break-in has occurred, you should contact your
Host Administrator.  The flow of security incident reporting should be from
the end user to the Host Administrator or other appropriate individual, who
then determines if the problem is local or network related.  If the problem
is network related, the Host Administrator should refer the problem to the
appropriate site as noted in DDN Security Bulletin 9003 [7].  In such cases,
the Host Administrator's first step is to call the MILNET Monitoring Center
for your area.  Phone numbers for the Monitoring Centers are found in Section
9.2.



7.3  Network Conduct

The network environment is somewhat different from the traditional workplace. 
Rules for proper conduct are gradually emerging to fit this new environment. 
The rules and guidelines presented here relate to four areas:

    *  passwords
    *  file protection
    *  plagiarism
    *  network mail


7.3.1  Passwords

Since use of the network is restricted, passwords, access codes, and TAC cards
should never be shared.  Change your host login password regularly and report
any unauthorized use of passwords to your Host Administrator.  MILNET TAC
cards and records of host Userids and Access Codes should be kept in a safe
place.  Users should be familiar with and follow local security guidelines.





NIC 60001, February 1993
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS AND NETWORK CONDUCT                            Page 55


7.3.2  File Protection

Most operating systems have a method of protecting files from network read and
write access.  The recommended file protection default for directories is "no
read and no write to outside users."  If your files are protected in this way,
you can still make them accessible to outside users over the network, but you
must take action to reset file and directory protections to make this happen.

As a new user, you should find out what the protection default is on your host
and ensure that files you don't want accessible to other users are protected. 
Ask you Host Administrator about default file and directory protection
settings and for instructions on protecting/unprotecting files.


7.3.3  Plagiarism

Even if a file is unprotected, you are not free to copy or read it without
first asking permission.  It is as inappropriate to read online mail or
browse through online files without permission as it would be to read a
colleague's hardcopy mail or rummage around in his desk.

Electronic plagiarism of another's work is just as unethical as plagiarism by
any other means.  Be sure to credit users whose work you cite or whose ideas
you express.  Copyright laws must also be carefully observed and obeyed.

It is easy and convenient to exchange code and programming across the network.

Many code developers are extremely generous in sharing their work.  Even so,
before copying or using someone else's code, be sure to get permission from
the developer or maintainer and credit the source in your documentation.

Under no circumstances should programming or code from anywhere on the network
be used (verbatim or edited) commercially without the owner's explicit
permission.


7.3.4  Mail

Electronic mail is a powerful communication tool that must be used with care. 
The following guidelines will help you avoid offending other users and
overloading the network.

It is easy to forward mail you receive; but the writer may never have intended
that anyone else read the message.  For this reason, it is wise to check with
the sender before forwarding a private message of any significance.

The DDN is a business environment, so try to keep your messages short and to
the point.  It is easy to send off a quick message, only to realize a moment
later that you needed to say more.  To avoid this, organize your thoughts and
send a single message rather than several incomplete ones.  This will make
your mail far more useful to the recipients, and minimize the load on the
network.

Online mail tends to change a person's style of communication.  Sending mail
is so quick that it is tempting to send your immediate reaction to a message
rather than a more considered, appropriate response.  Do not use derogatory
or inappropriate language in messages, especially those sent to discussion
groups.  Keep in mind that no one likes to be offended or embarrassed by
careless comments.




NIC 60001, February 1993
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS AND NETWORK CONDUCT                            Page 56


Finally, if you regularly send mail to a large group, learn how to create a
mailing list.  Otherwise, each recipient must scroll through a list of the
mailboxes of all other recipients as a part of the message header.

Remember, use of the network is a privilege.  It is your duty to use the
network responsibly as it was intended to be used and to obey general network
policies.  In return, the network gives you access to many tools and to an
online community of other network users.

                 SECTION 8.  NETWORK CONCEPTS OVERVIEW


8.1  Introduction

In the following paragraphs, we provide some general information about topics
such as usage-sensitive billing, network gateways/concentrators, network
addresses, the Domain Name System, and GOSIP.  Although most new DDN users
will not be actively involved in any of the areas covered in this section,
they do involve concepts you should become familiar with, since they are
important to all DDN users.



8.2  Usage-Sensitive Billing

The usage-sensitive billing system was implemented on the DDN to distribute
costs more equitably, based on actual use of network resources.  The tariff
structure is designed to support cost recovery so that the amount recovered
from each subscriber is proportional to that subscriber's use of network
resources.

Generally speaking, all hosts and dedicated terminals are charged a basic
monthly rate.  Users' network connections are charged on a per-minute basis. 
A charge is also levied for each kilopacket of traffic sent by each host or
terminal user.  Charges reflect peak-versus-nonpeak usage and precedence
level.

Monthly bills are sent to designated representatives of the military branches
as well as to other Government agencies.  The bills are then distributed
according to locally established policies.  That is, a packet of several
bills might be sent to a site and then distributed to other individuals by
the billing Point of Contact (POC) at that site.

It is rare for an individual user to see a bill.  However, you should be
aware that your use of the DDN does affect costs charged back to your service
and, perhaps, to your host site.  Therefore, all users should be conscientious
in conforming to host-site usage policies.

The NIC provides a Usage Sensitive Billing (USB) Service Desk to help answer
inquiries from DDN users or user organizations regarding the traffic and/or
connection charges shown on their billing reports.  USB Service Desk personnel
are available by phone Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern time.  Electronic mail is accepted 24 hours per day.

Service Desk personnel have access to many sources of DDN usage information. 
They are available to answer general questions as well as site- or user-
specific questions.  In the event a question or inquiry goes beyond the scope
of the Service Desk, the caller can be referred to a more appropriate contact
or agency.

Use the following information to contact the USB Service Desk:

8.3  Network Concentrators

Networks can be categorized according to size or geographic distribution, and
they can be referred to as local area networks (LANs) or wide area networks
(WANs).  A LAN might serve a single office, a building, or an entire military
site.  WANs are typically cross-country networks employing technologies such
as satellites or long distance land lines; they can serve large geographic
areas such as military installations located throughout the world.  The DDN
is a WAN that reaches all major DoD installations worldwide.

To expand computer communications not only across geographic distances, but
also across different networking technologies, gateways are used to connect
networks together into internetworks or "internets."  The DDN is part of an
IP-based internetwork, known to DDN users as "the Internet."

The use of gateway concentrators as a method of connecting to the DDN is a
relatively new trend.  Gateway concentrators enable LANs and hosts at military
installations to connect to the DDN.  Concentrators lessen the need for
individual host connections without limiting local users' access to full DDN
service.

Gateway concentrator use increased when DISA limited the number of PSN
ports that would be available to connect hosts directly to the DDN.  This
limitation, coupled with the long lead time required for direct host
connections, lent impetus to the establishment of gateway concentrator
programs for the military.  Currently, the Air Force and the Army have
concentrator programs to fulfill their long-haul data communication
requirements.  These programs have become their primary method of connecting
unclassified computer systems to the DDN.

Gateway concentrators provide a number of advantages for connecting
installations to the DDN: 

    *   Greater Connection Capacity
        With the installation of a gateway concentrator at a local site, the
        number of hosts that can be connected to the DDN is no longer limited
        by the number of ports available on a PSN.  Instead, many hosts can
        be connected to a concentrator, and the total amount of traffic they
        pass to the DDN is accommodated by the connection between the gateway
        concentrator and the MILNET PSN to which it is attached.

    *   Quick Connection
        The gateway concentrator program was designed to allow multiple hosts
        to access a single DDN port simultaneously.  Computers at an
        installation that requires unclassified worldwide communication will
        be connected to the Internet automatically because their local
        networks are attached to the Internet via the concentrator.  Thus,
        these hosts will not require direct connections to DDN ports.  This
        configuration enables the various military services (e.g., Air Force,
        Army) to manage their host connections directly and to avoid the long
        wait for individual host connections to DDN ports.

NETWORK CONCEPTS OVERVIEW                                              Page 59


    *   Lower Cost Per Host
        Because of the DDN usage-sensitive billing system structure, the
        gateway concentrator programs reduce costs for DDN connection.  With
        the installation of a gateway concentrator, the charges for initial
        host connections are reduced, as the service is charged only once for
        the initial connection of the concentrator itself rather than for
        each individual host connection.  In addition, traffic between local
        hosts on the network behind a gateway concentrator will not be billed
        because such traffic will not travel across DDN facilities.

The Air Force has a help desk at the Internet Control Center (INCC) to aid
concentrator users in accessing the DDN:

        AFINCC@SERVER.AF.MIL
        Headquarters Standard Systems Center/AQFC
        Building 857, Room 200A

        DSN: 596-5771, 596-5861


8.4  Network Addressing

The network address is the official numeric address of a host, TAC, or
gateway (as opposed to the official name by which these entities are
addressed). Network addresses take the format "nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn" (dotted
decimal format), where nnn represents an up to 3-digit decimal identifier
from 0 through 255, and each numeric component is separated from the next
with a period.  Each decimal part represents one octet of a 32-bit network
address.  The standard Internet address is divided into two parts: a network
part and a local host part.  Based on this two-part division, three classes
of Internet addresses have been defined:  Class A, Class B, and Class C.


CLASS A Network Addresses

Class A network addresses have the following characteristics:

    *   Composed of a 1-byte network address and a 3-byte local
        address.
    *   The highest-order bit of the (1-byte) network address is set to 0.
    *   Therefore, the first (or network address) byte of a CLASS A
        address must be in the range from 0 to 127.
    *   Consequently, CLASS A could have as many as 128 networks with
        224 (16,777,216) hosts on each of these networks.

All directly connected MILNET hosts are on network 26, which is a Class A
network.

For MILNET hosts, 

    *   the first part of the address is the network number (26); 
    *   the second part is the physical port number on the host's PSN; 
    *   the third part is the logical port number (normally zero for MILNET
        hosts);
    *   the fourth part is the number of the PSN to which the host is
        connected.

Therefore, a host with the address 26.31.0.73 is on network 26 (the number
assigned to the MILNET) and is attached to port 31 on PSN 73.

NETWORK CONCEPTS OVERVIEW                                              Page 60


CLASS B Network Addresses

Class B network addresses have the following characteristics:

    *   The two high-order bytes of the Internet address contain the
        network number, while the two low-order bytes contain the local
        host number.
    *   The highest order bits are set to 10, which means that the
        first byte must be a number in the range 128 to 191.
    *   Consequently, CLASS B could have as many as 16,384 networks
        with 216 (65,536) hosts on each of these networks.


CLASS C Network Addresses

Class C network addresses have the following characteristics:

    *   The network number is contained in the three high-order bytes
        of the Internet address, while the local host address is
        represented in the single low-order byte.
    *   The three highest-order bits of the network address are set to
        110.
    *   Therefore, the first byte must be in the range 192 to 233.
    *   Consequently, CLASS C could have as 2,097,152 networks with 28
        (256) hosts on each of these networks.

The Internet Registry (IR) at the DDN NIC assigns the network portion of an
address to a network.  The local network coordinator for a specific host
assigns the local portion of that host's network address.

Here are some examples of how each type of network number looks:

               Class A:  26.31.0.73          26.0.0.0
               Class B:  128.18.1.1          128.18.0.0
               Class C:  192.67.67.20        192.67.67.0

       [NOTE:  A network address is different from a user's address.  The
       term "user address" refers to a person's electronic mailbox, such
       as henry@nic.ddn.mil.]

In addition to the three classes defined above, a class of addresses whose
three highest order bits are 111 has been defined.  It is currently in limited
use.  This class is sometimes referred to as "CLASS D."  Figure 8-1 on the
next page graphically represents the three major Internet address classes.

8.4.1  Finding Network Address Information

The WHOIS database at the NIC contains POC information for every network the
IR (Internet Registry)  assigns; however, it may not contain information for
every host on a network.  Therefore, remember to search on the network portion
of the address rather than the complete address when you are using the WHOIS
program to obtain information on a host.

For example, the Class C address

                            192.112.36.70

is not in the database, but searching on

                            192.112.36.0 

shows you information for LOCALNET.  When using WHOIS to find the POC
information for a network, set the local portion(s) of the address to zero. 
(See Section 6.3.1.3 for an example of using WHOIS to search for a network
address.)

8.4.2  Obtaining Network Addresses

DISA assigns all MILNET network addresses (Class A, network 26), and the
MILNET Manager must approve any changes to or deletions of MILNET network
addresses.

The NIC assigns all other Class B and C network addresses.  Requests to
obtain an official Class B or C number or to make changes to hosts registered
with these addresses should be directed online to HOSTMASTER@NIC.DDN.MIL.
To arrange for a hardcopy application, call the NIC at 1 (800) 365-DNIC. 
Applications can also be requested through the SERVICE mail server (see
Section 6.3.5).


8.4.3  Knowing Your Network Address

Each user should know the network address of his/her host.  It is especially
important to know your host's address if you use a TAC or Mini-TAC because
you will have to enter the address as part of the TAC login sequence.  Your
host address is often--but not always--the address printed on your TAC card
by the label AUTHORIZING HOST.  Even if you have a script file or program
that enters this information for you as you log in, learn your address so
you can tell it to the NIC or the MILNET Monitoring Center if you call them
about a login problem.


8.5  The Domain Name System

Until the mid-1980s, a DDN host could find data on hostname-to-network-address
translation solely through the use of a file called the host table, which was
generated at the NIC.

The host table contained the name and network address of every host that was
registered with the NIC.  Individual host sites had to transfer and install
new copies of the host table regularly in order to have correct host
addressing information.  The host table had to be updated frequently to
enable mail and other data to be sent back and forth across the Internet.

As time went on, however, the number of hosts listed in the host table became
so large that the file was difficult to maintain efficiently, as well as
difficult and time-consuming for sites to transfer.  As an alternative to
the host table file, the Domain Name System (DNS) was developed.  Currently,
the NIC maintains data for both the host table and the DNS.  The host table
listing is an extremely restricted subset of the hosts registered in the
Domain Name System.

In a nutshell, the DNS is a way of administratively grouping hosts into a
hierarchy of authority.  The DNS allows addressing information to be widely
distributed and updated locally, which results in more efficient data
retrieval and maintenance.  Complete conversion to the DNS will eliminate the
need for one site to maintain a centralized table of names and addresses.

Under the DNS, host name and address information, along with other data, is
distributed throughout the network in a hierarchical scheme.  At the top of
the hierarchy are the root servers that contain information about the top-
level and second-level domains.  At the bottom of the hierarchy are the
individual hosts.





NIC 60001, February 1993
NETWORK CONCEPTS OVERVIEW                                              Page 63


Each domain within the DNS must have two hosts that provide name service for
it, which means that these hosts must run programs called name servers.  When
queried by programs known as resolvers (located on individual hosts), these
name servers provide name and address information to/for the particular hosts
within their domain.  (The hosts themselves are called servers, even though,
technically, a server is a program.)  Each server contains a subset of
Internet domain information.  If a query arrives at a server that does not
have address information for a particular host, it will be able to direct the
query to the server where the information resides.

Queries regarding specific hostnames usually begin by asking a server that
knows about the top-level domain under which that host falls.  Currently,
most domains on the Internet are registered within one of the following
top-level domains:

    *   COM   for commercial institutions
    *   EDU   for educational institutions
    *   GOV   for non-military government agencies and organizations
    *   MIL   for military agencies and organizations
    *   NET   for backbone networking entities
    *   ORG   for non-profit institutions.

Top-level domains are also registered for countries--e.g., BE for Belgium
and FI for Finland.  The NIC registers information for only the top level
of these country domains.  Lower-level domains are registered within the
country.

Hosts registered on the Internet must have names that reflect the domains
under which they are registered.  Such names are called Fully Qualified
Domain Names (FQDNs) and include all domains of which the host is a part. 
For example, NIC.DDN.MIL is the name of the NIC's main host.  The hostname
NIC.DDN.MIL, when taken piece by piece, gives information about the host
itself.  A hostname ending in MIL signifies sponsorship from a military-
related organization.  The second-level domain, DDN, indicates that
the host is used by an organization within the DDN.  The third-level
domain, NIC, indicates the host is used by the NIC.

Between the root servers and the individual hosts are other hosts that act
as servers and contain part of the information within the DNS hierarchy. 
For example, a program looking for the address of NIC.DDN.MIL might first
send a query to a root server.  The root server would not know the address
of NIC.DDN.MIL in particular, but would direct the query to another server
that had information about the DDN.MIL domain.  The second server would know
which hosts provide name service about NIC.DDN.MIL and direct the query to
those hosts.  Finally, the query would arrive at the specific host providing
name service for NIC.DDN.MIL. That host would return the network address
information via the DNS to the host that initiated the query.  All of this
happens very quickly--in less than a minute.

Mail programs must know the address of each host to which they send mail. 
Users normally include a hostname in the headers of their messages.  The
mail program queries either the DNS or a host table to translate that
hostname to a network address.  This enables the mail message to be delivered
across the network.

For example, if a user named Sam wants to send mail to his friend Joe at the
host EXAMPLE.SAMPLE.COM, he can do so in one of two ways.




NIC 60001, February 1993
NETWORK CONCEPTS OVERVIEW                                              Page 64



    1.  Via the Host Table--

        *   The host EXAMPLE.SAMPLE.COM is registered in the host table
            along with its netaddress.

        *   The mail program finds the correct netaddress from the host
            table on the sender's local host and sends the mail to Joe.

            In this method of transmission, every host that Sam wants to
            communicate with must be listed in the host table file on his
            own host.  Sam may not be able to reply to messages sent to
            him if his host does not recognize the hostname in the sender's
            return address.

    2.  Via the Domain Name System--

        *   The mail program trying to deliver a message addressed
            to JOE@EXAMPLE.SAMPLE.COM sends a tracker called a query to
            one of seven root servers.

        *   The root server has information on the COM top-level domain
            and knows which two domain servers hold further information
            on the SAMPLE.COM domain.  

        *   The root server points the query to those domain servers.  

        *   When the query arrives at the ultimate destination server, it
            learns the netaddress of the host EXAMPLE.SAMPLE.COM, and the
            mail program obtains the information necessary to establish a
            path from the sender's host to Joe's host.

        *   The query directs the mail down that path to Joe's mail account
            on the EXAMPLE.SAMPLE.COM host.



8.6  Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP)

The Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP) is a document
that describes the Government's plans to transition its networks from the
TCP/IP-based protocols to international protocols based on the Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.  The goal is to add OSI-based functions
to the Internet without sacrificing services now available to Internet users.

Several documents pertain to GOSIP or its implementation; however, we will
mention only one resource that will point you toward the most current
information available.

RFC 1169, "Explaining the Role of GOSIP," [6] discusses how GOSIP should be
applied to near-term network planning and explains the role and applicability
of the GOSIP document.  In addition, it has an appendix that describes other
GOSIP documents and tells how to obtain them.  The appendix also lists
contacts for further information regarding the documents.  This RFC will
probably be updated as the status of GOSIP changes, so check the RFC Index,
available at the NIC, to ensure that you have the most current information.

9.2  Network Monitoring Centers (NMCs)

The three Network Monitoring Centers are:

   *  The CONUS MILNET Monitoring Center (CMMC) located at DISA
      headquarters in Washington, DC.  The CMMC provides a toll-free
      hotline Trouble Desk phone number for quick reporting of network
      problems.

   *  The Pacific MILNET Monitoring Center (PMMC) located at Wheeler AFB
      in Hawaii.

   *  The European MILNET Monitoring Center (EMMC) located in Patch
      Barracks, Vaihingen, Germany.

All NMCs provide operations support for several DoD packet-switching
networks. The NMCs concentrate on real-time network management, with the
primary objective of maximizing each network's operating efficiency.  In
addition, they receive the first DDN security incident reports.

Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., Communications Division (BBNCD) provides DDN
with operations and technical support, configuration management, software
maintenance and enhancement, hardware maintenance, and required hardware.


9.2.1  NMC Services

NMC services include remote status monitoring, coordination of network outage
troubleshooting efforts, and 24-hours-per-day, 7-days-per-week technical
assistance to users.  The NMCs typically work on backbone-related outages
consisting of node and circuit problems; they provide help in determining
whether host connectivity problems are network related.

9.3  Host Administrators and Node Site Coordinators

Each host has a representative who serves as its technical and administrative
contact--the Host Administrator.  The Host Administrator provides important
host-related services such as the following:

   *  Collaborates with the DDN PMO on security matters involving hosts,

   *  Interprets network policies as they apply to his/her host, 

   *  Decides which users may access the network (within the guidelines set
      by the DDN PMO),

   *  Authorizes user access to the MILNET Terminal Access Controllers
      (TACs) and Mini-TACs,

   *  Helps network users with technical problems involving hosts, and

   *  Works with the Network Information Center and the Network Monitoring
      Centers to provide information and technical assistance.




NIC 60001, February 1993
NETWORK SERVICE CENTERS AND CONTACTS                                   Page 68


Each network node, or PSN, has a Node Site Coordinator (NSC).  The Node Site
Coordinator is the local site representative who has access control,
accountability, and coordination responsibility for the DDN-owned network
hardware, software, and circuits located at the node site.

Occasionally, one person serves both roles.  A Host Administrator or Node
Site Coordinator may also designate an alternate who can assist with the
administrative or technical demands of the position.

To find the names, addresses, telephone numbers, and network mailboxes for
these contacts, see Section 6.3.


9.4  Military Communications and Operations Command Contacts

Each military department has designated an organization to serve as the
primary DDN Point of Contact.  Requests for information or assistance should
be directed to the following organizations:

the network is, "Now what?  What's out there?"  This section lists a few
places you can look for more information about what is available to Internet
users.


Special Interest Groups

An important part of the Internet are its many online Special Interest Groups
(SIGs), which discuss topics ranging from artificial intelligence to Zenith
PCs.  A SIG is an electronic mailing list dedicated to the discussion of a
particular topic.  SIGs are a good way for a new user to learn more about the
network.  Anyone can contribute to a SIG by simply sending mail, and most
SIGs are open for anyone to join.  Information on network SIGs can be found
in a file nicknamed the List-of-Lists, a master list of SIGs with a brief
description of each group and how to join it.

For users who have never done a file transfer before, this is a perfect
first opportunity.  You can use FTP to copy the List-of-Lists from the
FTP.NISC.SRI.COM host by logging in with "USERID anonymous" and "PASSWORD
guest" and using the pathname NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS. 

Note that many individual hosts redistribute mail for their users--that is,
mailing list messages or digests are delivered once to a single local mailbox,
and then they are announced or forwarded to a list of interested local users. 
Mail redistribution eliminates the need for the local mailer to process myriad
copies of the same message directed to different users and so conserves local
computer resources.  Before adding your name to a SIG distribution list, ask
your Host Administrator or User Representative if SIG or digest mail is
redistributed on your host or posted in a centralized place to be read by all
local users.

In addition, all traffic on the MILNET is subject to usage-sensitive billing,
so before adding your name to a SIG, be sure that the mail traffic you would
generate is consistent with the usage policies of your host.


NNSC Internet Resource Guide

The NSF Network Service Center (NNSC) compiles and makes available an Internet
Resource Guide.  The goal of the guide is to increase the visibility of
various Internet resources that might help users do their work better.  While
not yet an exhaustive list, the guide is a useful compendium of many resources
and can be very helpful to a new user.

In the NNSC guide, resources are grouped into sections by type.  Current
sections include descriptions of online library catalogs, data archives,
online white pages directory services, networks, network information centers,
and computational resources such as supercomputers.  Each entry contains the
following information:

    *  a description of the resource,
    *  an identification of who can use the resource, 
    *  an explanation of how to reach the resource network via the
       Internet,
    *  a list of contacts for more information.

The NNSC distributes the list electronically.  To receive a guide, or to get
on a mailing list that alerts you when it is updated, send a message to
RESOURCE-GUIDE-REQUEST@NNSC.NSF.NET.


FYI Documents

"FYIs" are a series of special RFCs.  The FYI documents address information
that is of general interest to the Internet user community.  They do not
define standards or contain protocol specifications.  Rather, they address
more general topics, provide insight into Internet conventions, answer
commonly asked questions, contain background or historical information, or
provide resource information such as bibliographies or descriptions of
software.  Some FYIs are addressed specifically to new users.

Because FYIs are also RFCs, they are listed along with all the other RFCs in
the RFC Index.  However, the file fyi/fyi-index.txt on the NIC host lists only
the FYIs.  Each index notes both the FYI number and the RFC number of each
FYI.  You can obtain the FYI Index online by FTPing it or by requesting it
through the SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL mail service.  See Section 5.1.2 for FTP
guidelines and Section 6.3.5 for directions on retrieving information via
SERVICE.


NIC Contacts Files

Often users need to communicate with the official Point of Contact
(POC) responsible for a specific network or domain.  While this information
is available via the WHOIS program on the NIC host, as described in Section
6.3.1, the NIC also provides files that contain compilations of the contacts
for domains and networks.  These files are updated weekly and provide a
central resource for useful domain and network POC information.

    *  netinfo/network-contacts.txt lists all assigned networks by number
       and lists the name of the network, plus the name, phone number,
       and electronic mailbox for each POC.

    *  netinfo/domain-contacts.txt is organized by domain name and lists
       the name, phone number, and electronic mailbox for each domain
       POC. 

With the network information sources and contacts just outlined and the tools
introduced in the previous section, you are now ready to explore the network
on your own.

APPENDIX B                                                             Page 79



                  APPENDIX B.  COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS


Here are answers to some of the questions most commonly asked by users.  The
selections were made from questions addressed to the DDN Network Information
Center.  (See Sections 6.1 for NIC network and U.S. mail addresses.)


1.  I want to send mail to my colleague, John Smith.  What is his
    network mailbox?

    Answer:
    The NIC provides an online program called WHOIS (or NICNAME) that
    contains the names, addresses, phone numbers, and online mailboxes of
    many network users.  Since some Host Administrators install this program
    on their host, you should ask him/her if it is available locally. 
    Alternatively, you may make a TELNET connection to NIC.DDN.MIL and use
    the WHOIS program running on the NIC host.  (Login to NIC.DDN.MIL is not
    required.)  The WHOIS program may also be accessed via electronic mail. 
    Send a message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and include the word WHOIS and the
    item you wish to search for in the subject line of your message.  You
    will receive an answer overnight. For more information on using SERVICE,
    see Section 6.3.5.


2.  This TAC phone number doesn't work.  What should I do?

    Answer:
    The Network Information Center can try to access the TAC from its site
    to determine if the problem is in the TAC or if it relates to your
    equipment or the procedure you are using.  If the problem is the TAC, we
    can give you phone numbers for other TACs.  We can help you coordinate
    with the MILNET Monitoring Center to report the TAC problem.


3.  I will be traveling and need to log in to read my mail.  How can I find
    a TAC phone number to use while I'm on the road?

    Answer:
    You can locate TAC phone numbers in several ways.  The back of your
    TAC card lists many of them.  The TACNEWS program available on the
    NIC.DDN.MIL host has a menu option that will show you the three TACs
    closest to a phone number you provide.  TACNEWS also provides lists of
    phone numbers for TACs both within and outside the U.S.  See Section
    6.3.2.1 for an example of TACNEWS usage.  In addition, if you call the
    NIC Help Desk, we will be happy to provide you with phone numbers of
    TACs.


4.  What is the difference between the MILNET and the DDN?

    Answer:
    The MILNET is a wide area network that constitutes one subnetwork of
    the DDN.  The MILNET carries unclassified operational data.  It is the
    segment of the DDN that is connected to the Internet.  The other
    subnetworks of the DDN carry classified information and are standalone
    networks.

5.  What is the difference between the MILNET and the Internet?

    Answer:
    The Internet is a collection of TCP/IP-based wide area and local area
    networks that are interconnected by various gateways so that users on
    one network can communicate to users on any of the other networks.  In
    addition, some non-TCP/IP-based networks, such as BITNET, are accessible
    to Internet users via electronic mail.  These networks are usually not
    strictly considered a part of "the Internet."  The MILNET is a wide area
    network that is connected to the Internet via connections called the
    Federal Inter-agency Exchanges (FIXs).


6.  I see a connection on my host from a network number I don't recognize. 
    How can I find the number of someone to contact on that network to check
    on this connection?

    Answer:
    Every IP network number assigned by the Internet Registry at the NIC has
    a registered Point of Contact (POC) who is responsible for that network. 
    To find a particular POC, you can look up the number of the network via
    the NIC's WHOIS program.  Search only on the network portion of the
    number and type the local portions as zeroes.  (See Section 8.4 for a
    brief explanation of network addressing.  See Section 6.3.1 for how to
    use WHOIS.)  In addition, the NIC provides a publicly accessible,
    regularly updated file that lists all the POCs for each network number
    assigned.  The file is netinfo/network-contacts.txt.  The POC
    information is listed by network number.


7.  How do I get a TAC card?

    Answer:
    Before you can get a TAC card, you must have an account on a host.  Then
    the Host Administrator of a MILNET host (that is, a host whose address
    is on network 26) must approve a TAC card for you.  See Section 4 for a
    more complete explanation of TAC cards and TAC usage.


8.  What is an RFC?

    Answer:
    As RFC 1177 [8] explains, the Request for Comments documents (RFCs) are
    working notes of the Internet research and development community.  A
    document in this series may be on essentially any topic related to
    computer communication, and may consist of anything from a meeting
    report to the specification of a standard.  Most RFCs are descriptions
    of network protocols or services, often giving detailed procedures and
    formats.  These RFCs generally provide information in sufficient
    technical detail to enable developers to create implementations.  Other
    RFCs report on the results of policy studies or summarize the work of
    technical committees or workshops.  Currently, all Internet standards
    are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs are standards.  RFCs are
    publicly available on the NIC.DDN.MIL host.  Indexes of RFCs organized
    by number (in reverse order with the most current RFC at the top), by
    author, or by title are available from the NIC as well.  Hardcopies are
    available from SRI International in Menlo Park, CA (the former NIC).

9.  May I be registered in the WHOIS database?

    Answer:
    Any TAC user must be registered with the NIC.  In addition, any other
    MILNET user can be added to the WHOIS database if he has a working
    network mailbox.  Information regarding a registered user, such as his
    address and network mailbox, is visible via the WHOIS program.  Thus,
    WHOIS acts as a "white pages" directory of network users, enabling other
    users to ascertain where to send mail to them, either electronically or
    via the U.S. postal service.  To register in the database, fill out the
    template provided in Section 6.2.1 (or the version currently approved
    and located in the NIC templates directory) and return it online to
    REGISTRAR@NIC.DDN.MIL.  The NIC depends on users to send updated
    information whenever their addresses or mailboxes change.  Changes
    involving TAC access or registrations of new TAC users must be forwarded
    by an authorized Host Administrator, however.
