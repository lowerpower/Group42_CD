	THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE NETWORK INFORMATION CENTER (DoD NIC)


The Department of Defense Network Information Center (DoD NIC) is located at
Government Systems, Inc., Chantilly, VA, and is funded by the Defense
Information Systems Agency to provide general user services to DISN
users via telephone, electronic mail, and the U.S. Postal Service.

The DoD NIC works closely with the DISN Host Administrators, Node Site
Coordinators, Domain Administrators, Network Administrators, and other
Service administrative authorities to assist new and existing users in
obtaining pertinent network information.

Databases and information servers of interest to network users are
provided, including the WHOIS registry of network users, hosts, networks,
domains, and communucations server authorities. There is also the NIC/Query
browsing system, TAC Info and Net News.  The DoD NIC is the source for various
reference documents, and maintains a RFC (Request for Comments) 
collection.  Many of the online files are available through the DODNIC's
automatic mail service, SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL.

The DoD NIC registers DoD hosts and domains, assigns IP network numbers and
Autonomous System Numbers for DoD entities, and provides domain name
system server files to the NIPRNET community. The DoD NIC also registers
NIPRNET users and administrators and issues Communications Server (CS) cards 
when authorized.

a. How to Retrieve DoD NIC files Using FTP

To retrieve any of the DoD NIC's public files via your local FTP program,
connect to the NIC.DDN.MIL host, and log in as ANONYMOUS with password
GUEST.  FTP program use varies slightly from host to host, so please
consult your Host Administrator for instructions, if needed.


b. How to Retrieve DoD NIC Files Using Kermit

The DoD NIC provides a Kermit server for file retrieval.  Users should connect
to the NIC.DDN.MIL host from a CS. To run the DoD NIC's Kermit server from a
CS, provide your User ID and Access Code when prompted. Then type

SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL is an automated service provided by the DoD 
Network Information Center.  It allows access to DoD NIC documents and
information via ordinary electronic mail.  This is especially useful
for users who do not have access to the DoD NIC. 

   To use the mail service, send a mail message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL.
In the SUBJECT field, request the type of service you wish followed by
any needed arguments.  The message body is normally ignored.  Large files
will be broken into smaller separate messages.  The information you
request will be sent back to you as soon as possible.

The following services are currently available:

Send comments or suggestions to NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL.  Send questions
and bug reports to ACTION@NIC.DDN.MIL.


VIII. USER REGISTRATION
NOTE: This information is also available through our WWW page at
NIC.DDN.MIL

Host Administrators have overall responsibility for registering their
users.  When new users acquire accounts on DISN hosts, their Host
Administrator must complete a DoD NIC generated template to register them in
the DoD NIC database.  Names and addresses of Host Administrators are found on
the NIC.DDN.MIL host in the files netinfo/mil-host-administrators-a-l.txt,
and netinfo/mil-host-administrators-m-z.txt.

End users who require DISN CS dial-up access to reach their hosts must
have CS Access cards that are provided by the DoD NIC.  Approval for
distributing the card is sent to the DoD NIC from the user's Local Access
Authority.  Until the user is permanently registered, there may be
temporary "Organizational" cards available from the Organizational Card
Custodian.


IX. HOST, DOMAIN, NETWORK NUMBER, IN-ADDR, AND ASN REGISTRATION
NOTE: All templates are available through our WWW page at
NIC.DDN.MIL.

The DoD NIC is responsible for the registration of hosts, domains, IP
networks, and autonomous systems numbers (ASNs) used by various
DoD services and agencies.

To include a new host in the DoD NIC WHOIS database, the template
found in netinfo/mil-host-template.txt needs to be completed and returned
to HOSTMASTER@NIC.DDN.MIL.  All hosts acting as domain or IN-ADDR
server, routers, gateways, or email servers must be registered.

Three times each week, information is generated and installed into the 
DoD NIC WHOIS database.                                                  

Military domains are registered via the domain template found in
netinfo/domain-template.txt.  New domain information is installed into
the  DNS root servers three times per week.  Information
regarding the root servers is kept in netinfo/root-servers.txt.

Military network number assignments are made when a network POC completes
the template in netinfo/internet-number-template.txt and returns the
template to Hostmaster.  

To provide address to hostname reverse resolution, military IN-ADDR 
domains are registered within the domain root servers via an IN-ADDR
template sent to the HOSTMASTER mailbox.  This template can be found
in netinfo/in-addr-template.txt.

The DoD NIC assigns military autonomous system numbers (ASNs) when 
the template found in netinfo/asn-template.txt is sent to
HOSTMASTER@NIC.DDN.MIL.  A complete listing of assigned ASNs
is found in netinfo/asn.txt.

From the domain, network number, and ASN templates, POC information is
extracted and individuals that are not already registered are given
records in the WHOIS database.



X.  SECURITY COORDINATION CENTER
NOTE: The SCC can also be contacted through the WWW page at
NIC.DDN.MIL.

The DoD NIC is the site of the DISN Security Coordination Center (SCC).
The SCC acts in conjunction with the DISN Network Security Officer to
coordinate actions regarding security incidents and network
vulnerabilities.  The SCC relays security-related information to the
Network Security Officer and works with him in handling network
security problems.  In addition, the SCC issues DISN Security Bulletins
to network users.  The SCC can be contacted in these ways:
