States in Congress assembled, unless such state be actually invaded by      
enemies, or shall have received certain advice of a resolution being        
formed by some nation of Indians to invade such State, and the              
danger is so imminent as not to admit of a delay, till the United           
States in Congress assembled can be consulted: nor shall any state          
grant commissions to any ships or vessels of war, nor letters of            
marque or reprisal, except it be after a declaration of war by the          
United States in Congress assembled, and then only against the kingdom      
or State and the subjects thereof, against which war has been so            
declared, and under such regulations as shall be established by the         
United States in Congress assembled, unless such state be infested          
by pirates, in which case vessels of war may be fitted out for that         
occasion, and kept so long as the danger shall continue, or until           
the United States in Congress assembled shall determine otherwise.

forces shall be raised, or in such manner as such state shall               
direct, and all vacancies shall be filled up by the state which             
first made the appointment.

  Article VIII. All charges of war, and all other expenses that             
shall be incurred for the common defence or general welfare, and

defrayed out of a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the           
several States, in proportion to the value of all land within each          
state, granted to or surveyed for any person, as such land and the          
buildings and improvements thereon shall be estimated according to          
such mode as the United States in Congress assembled, shall from            
time to time direct and appoint. The taxes for paying that                  
proportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction          
of the legislatures of the several States within the time agreed            
upon by the United States in Congress assembled.

war, except in the cases mentioned in the sixth article- of sending         
and receiving ambassadors- entering into treaties and alliances,            
provided that no treaty of commerce shall be made whereby the               
legislative power of the respective States shall be restrained from         
imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners, as their own people         
are subjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or importation        
of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever- of establishing          
rules for deciding in all cases, what captures on land or water

member of Congress shall be appointed a judge of any of the said            
courts.                                                                     
  The United States in Congress assembled shall also be the last            
resort on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting or          
that hereafter may arise between two or more States concerning              
boundary, jurisdiction or any other cause whatever; which authority         
shall always be exercised in the manner following:- Whenever the            
legislative or executive authority or lawful agent State in                 
controversy with another shall present a petition to Congress, stating      
the matter in question and praying for a hearing, notice thereof shall      
be given by order of Congress to the legislative or executive               
authority of the other State in controversy, and a day assigned for         
the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents, who shall then        
be directed to appoint by joint consent, commissioners or judges to         
constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter in question;      
but if they cannot agree, Congress shall name three persons out of          
each of the United States, and from the list of such persons each           
party shall alternately strike out one, the petitioners beginning,          
until the number shall be reduced to thirteen; and from that number         
not less than seven, nor more than nine names as Congress shall             
direct, shall in the presence of Congress be drawn out by lot, and the      
persons whose names shall be so drawn or any five of them, shall be         
commissioners or judges, to hear and finally determine the                  
controversy, so always as a major part of the judges who shall hear         
the cause shall agree in the determination: and if either party             
shall neglect to attend at the day appointed, without showing reasons,      
which Congress shall judge sufficient, or being present shall refuse        
to strike, the Congress shall proceed to nominate three persons out of      
each State, and the Secretary of Congress shall strike in behalf of         
such party absent or refusing; and the judgment and sentence of the         
court to be appointed, in the manner before prescribed, shall be final      
and conclusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to         
the authority of such court, or to appear to defend their claim or          
cause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence,          
or judgment, which shall in like manner be final and decisive, the          
judgment or sentence and other proceedings being in either case             
transmitted to Congress, and lodged among the acts of Congress for the      
security of the parties concerned: provided that every commissioner,        
before he sits in judgment, shall take an oath to be administered by        
one of the judges of the supreme or superior court of the state, where      
the cause shall be tried, "well and truly to hear and determine the         
matter in question, according to the best of his judgment, without          
favor, affection or hope of reward;" provided also that no State shall      
be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States.              
  All controversies concerning the private right of soil claimed under      
different grants of two or more States, whose jurisdictions as they         
may respect such lands, and the States which passed such grants are         
adjusted, the said grants or either of them being at the same time          
claimed to have originated antecedent to such settlement of                 
jurisdiction, shall on the petition of either party to the Congress of      
the United States, be finally determined as near as may be in the same      
manner as is before prescribed for deciding disputes respecting             
territorial jurisdiction between different States.                          
  The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and      
exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin         
struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective States-         
fixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the United           
States.- regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the             
Indians, not members of any of the States, provided that the                
legislative right of any state within its own limits be not                 
infringed or violated- establishing and regulating post offices from        
one State to another, throughout all the United States, and exacting        
such postage on the papers passing through the same as may be               
requisite to defray the expenses of the said office- appointing all         
officers of the land forces, in the service of the United States,           
excepting regimental officers- appointing all the officers of the           
naval forces, and commissioning all officers whatever in the service        
of the United States -making rules for the government and regulation        
of the said land and naval forces, and directing their operations.          
  The United States in Congress assembled shall have authority to           
appoint a committee, to sit in the recess of Congress, to be                
denominated "A Committee of the States," and to consist of one              
delegate from each state; and to appoint such other committees and          
civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of      
the United States under their direction- to appoint one of their            
number to preside, provided that no person be allowed to serve in           
the office of president more than one year in any term of three years;      
to ascertain the necessary sums of Money to be raised for the               
service of the United States, and to appropriate and apply the same         
for defraying the public expenses- to borrow money, or emit bills on        
the credit of the United States, transmitting every half year to the        
respective States an account of the sums of money so borrowed or            
emitted,- to build and equip a navy- to agree upon the number of            
land forces, and to make requisitions from each state for its quota,        
in proportion to the number of white inhabitants in such state;             
which requisition shall be binding, and thereupon the legislature of        
each State shall appoint the regimental officers, raise the men and         
clothe, arm and equip them in a soldier like manner, at the expense of      
the United States, and the officers and men so clothed, armed and           
equipped shall march to the place appointed, and within the time            
agreed on by the United States in Congress assembled. But if the            
United States in Congress assembled shall, on consideration of              
circumstances judge proper that any State should not raise men, or          
should raise a smaller number than its quota, and that any other state      
should raise a greater number of men than the quota thereof, such           
extra number shall be raised, officered, clothed, armed and equipped        
in the same manner as the quota of such State, unless the                   
legislature of such state shall judge that such extra number cannot be      
safely spared out of the same, in which case they shall raise officer,      
clothe, arm and equip as many of such extra number as they judge can        
be safely spared.  And the officers and men so clothed, armed and
