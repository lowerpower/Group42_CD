        seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that

001:007<td>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased

        it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they
        join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get
        them up out of the land. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them

        are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
        delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
        multiplied, and waxed very mighty. <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and
