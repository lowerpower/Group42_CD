        Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do
        give to them, even to the children of Israel. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
        have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great
        river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and
        unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
        your coast. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
        days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee:
        I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
        thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto
        their fathers to give them. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest
        observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant
        commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the
        left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but
        thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
        observe to do according to all that is written therein: for
        then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt
        have good success. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be
        not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is
        with thee whithersoever thou goest. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare
        you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this
        Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God
        giveth you to possess it. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the
        tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD
        commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest,
        and hath given you this land. <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
        the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
        shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
        valour, and help them; <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
        you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your
        God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
        possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave
        you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising. <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us
        we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
        hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he
        was with Moses. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and
        will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest
        him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good
        courage. <tr><td valign=top>

        there. <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there

002:004<td>And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus,

        them. <tr><td valign=top>

        the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all
        the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red
        sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto
        the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side
        Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
        neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
        of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and
        in earth beneath. <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I

        us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. <tr><td valign=top>

        house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. <tr><td valign=top>

002:016<td>And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
        pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
        the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
        oath which thou hast made us swear. <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line
        of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down

        brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee. <tr><td valign=top>

        the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
        him. <tr><td valign=top>

002:020<td>And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
        thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. <tr><td valign=top>

002:021<td>And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she
        sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet

002:022<td>And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there
        three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers
        sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. <tr><td valign=top>

002:023<td>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
        passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him
        all things that befell them: <tr><td valign=top>

        it. <tr><td valign=top>

        the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took
        up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. <tr><td valign=top>

        magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know
        that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. <tr><td valign=top>

        of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. <tr><td valign=top>

        Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the
        Jebusites. <tr><td valign=top>

        dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of

        out of Egypt. <tr><td valign=top>

        wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which

        Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
        Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered
        them into your hand. <tr><td valign=top>

024:012<td>And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
        before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with
        thy sword, nor with thy bow. <tr><td valign=top>

024:013<td>And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
        cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the
        vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. <tr><td valign=top>

024:014<td>Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
        truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the
        other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

024:015<td>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you
        this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your
        fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or
        the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for
        me and my house, we will serve the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

024:016<td>And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
        forsake the LORD, to serve other gods; <tr><td valign=top>

024:017<td>For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our
        fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
        and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
        in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people
        through whom we passed: <tr><td valign=top>

024:018<td>And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the
        Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve
        the LORD; for he is our God. <tr><td valign=top>

024:019<td>And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
        he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
        your transgressions nor your sins. <tr><td valign=top>

024:020<td>If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
        turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done

024:021<td>And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
        LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

024:022<td>And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
        yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And

024:023<td>Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
        among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel. <tr><td valign=top>

024:024<td>And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we
        serve, and his voice will we obey. <tr><td valign=top>

024:025<td>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
        them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. <tr><td valign=top>

024:026<td>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
        and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that
        was by the sanctuary of the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

024:027<td>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall
        be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the
        LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness
        unto you, lest ye deny your God. <tr><td valign=top>

024:032<td>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
        up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground
        which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem
        for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance
        of the children of Joseph. <tr><td valign=top>
