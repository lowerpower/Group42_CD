001:001 <td>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the
        children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for
        us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them? <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered
        the land into his hand. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into
        my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I
        likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with
        him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and
        the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
        ten thousand men. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against
        him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
        him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
        thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under
        my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
        brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and
        had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and
        set the city on fire. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
        the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south,
        and in the valley. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
        (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew
        Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and
        the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher: <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
        it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him
        to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her
        ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou? <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
        me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave
        her the upper springs and the nether springs. <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up
        out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into
        the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and
        they went and dwelt among the people. <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
        Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
        And the name of the city was called Hormah. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with
        the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants
        of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of
        the valley, because they had chariots of iron. <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he
        expelled thence the three sons of Anak. <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
        that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the
        children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day. <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
        the LORD was with them. <tr><td valign=top>

001:023<td>And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name
        of the city before was Luz.) <tr><td valign=top>

001:024<td>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
        said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
        city, and we will shew thee mercy. <tr><td valign=top>

001:025<td>And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
        the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man
        and all his family. <tr><td valign=top>

001:026<td>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a
        city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name
        thereof unto this day. <tr><td valign=top>

001:027<td>Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean
        and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants
        of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her
        towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the
        Canaanites would dwell in that land. <tr><td valign=top>

001:028<td>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
        Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out. <tr><td valign=top>

001:029<td>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
        Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. <tr><td valign=top>

001:030<td>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
        the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among
        them, and became tributaries. <tr><td valign=top>

001:031<td>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
        inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
        Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob: <tr><td valign=top>

001:032<td>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
        of the land: for they did not drive them out. <tr><td valign=top>

001:033<td>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
        nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the
        Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
        inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries
        unto them. <tr><td valign=top>

001:034<td>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
        for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: <tr><td valign=top>

001:035<td>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
        Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so
        that they became tributaries. <tr><td valign=top>

001:036<td>And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to
        Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>002:001 <td>And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and

        will never break my covenant with you. <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
        ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my
        voice: why have ye done this? <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before
        you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods
        shall be a snare unto you. <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these
        words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted
        up their voice, and wept. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
        sacrificed there unto the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
        went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all

        the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
        and served Baalim: <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought
        them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
        gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed
        themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
        delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them,

002:016<td>Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them
        out of the hand of those that spoiled them. <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
        went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto
        them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers
        walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did
        not so. <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was
        with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their
        enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD
        because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed
        them and vexed them. <tr><td valign=top>

        returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in

        they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn
        way. <tr><td valign=top>
