001:001 <td>Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
        there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
        Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and
        his wife, and his two sons. <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his
        wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
        Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country
        of Moab, and continued there. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
        two sons. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the
        one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they
        dwelled there about ten years. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
        was left of her two sons and her husband. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
        return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the
        country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in
        giving them bread. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
        her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to
        return unto the land of Judah. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each
        to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye
        have dealt with the dead, and with me. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the
        house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up
        their voice, and wept. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
        thy people. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
        me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be
        your husbands? <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to
        have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should
        have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons; <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
        for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it
        grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is
        gone out against me. <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
        kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her. <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
        people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in
        law. <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
        following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
        where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
        people, and thy God my God: <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the
        LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee
        and me. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,
        then she left speaking unto her. <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
        pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was
        moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for
        the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
        why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified
        against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in
        law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and
        they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>002:001 <td>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of
        wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
        field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall
        find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
        reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
        belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech. <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
        reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD
        bless thee. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
        Whose damsel is this? <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and
        said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
        of the country of Moab: <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the
        reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued
        even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in
        the house. <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
        not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but
        abide here fast by my maidens: <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou
        after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
        not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the
        vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
        and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that
        thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed
        me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the
        death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and
        thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
        people which thou knewest not heretofore. <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee
        of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to
        trust. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for
        that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
        friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of
        thine handmaidens. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat
        of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat
        beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she
        did eat, and was sufficed, and left. <tr><td valign=top>

002:015<td>And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young
        men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and
        reproach her not: <tr><td valign=top>

002:016<td>And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
        leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not. <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she
        had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley. <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in
        law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave
        to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed. <tr><td valign=top>

002:019<td>And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
        to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
        knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom
        she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought
        to day is Boaz. <tr><td valign=top>

002:020<td>And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
        LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to
        the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto
        us, one of our next kinsmen. <tr><td valign=top>

002:021<td>And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
        keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my
        harvest. <tr><td valign=top>

002:022<td>And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
        daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet
        thee not in any other field. <tr><td valign=top>

002:023<td>So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end
        of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her
        mother in law. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>003:001 <td>Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall
        I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? <tr><td valign=top>

003:002<td>And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou
        wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the
        threshingfloor. <tr><td valign=top>

003:003<td>Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment
        upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not
        thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating
        and drinking. <tr><td valign=top>

003:004<td>And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
        place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover
        his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
        shalt do. <tr><td valign=top>

003:005<td>And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do. <tr><td valign=top>

003:006<td>And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all
        that her mother in law bade her. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
        went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came
        softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
        turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
        handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for
        thou art a near kinsman. <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for
        thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the
        beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether
        poor or rich. <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that
        thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that
        thou art a virtuous woman. <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there
        is a kinsman nearer than I. <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he
        will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do
        the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
        kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,
        as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning. <tr><td valign=top>

003:014<td>And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up
        before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be
        known that a woman came into the floor. <tr><td valign=top>

003:015<td>Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and
        hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of
        barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city. <tr><td valign=top>

003:016<td>And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art
        thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done
        to her. <tr><td valign=top>

003:017<td>And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
        said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law. <tr><td valign=top>

003:018<td>Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
        matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he
        have finished the thing this day. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>004:001 <td>Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
        behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he
        said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
        aside, and sat down. <tr><td valign=top>

004:002<td>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit
        ye down here. And they sat down. <tr><td valign=top>

004:003<td>And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of
        the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our
        brother Elimelech's: <tr><td valign=top>

004:004<td>And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
        inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
        redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then
        tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it
        beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem
        it. <tr><td valign=top>

004:005<td>Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
        Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife
        of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
        inheritance. <tr><td valign=top>

004:006<td>And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I
        mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for
        I cannot redeem it. <tr><td valign=top>

004:007<td>Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
        redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things;
        a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and
        this was a testimony in Israel. <tr><td valign=top>

004:008<td>Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he
        drew off his shoe. <tr><td valign=top>

004:009<td>And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
        witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was
        Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the
        hand of Naomi. <tr><td valign=top>

004:010<td>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
        purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon
        his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from
        among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are
        witnesses this day. <tr><td valign=top>

004:011<td>And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders,
        said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come
        into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did
        build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,
        and be famous in Bethlehem: <tr><td valign=top>

004:012<td>And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
        unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this
        young woman. <tr><td valign=top>

004:013<td>So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in
        unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son. <tr><td valign=top>

004:014<td>And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
        not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be
        famous in Israel. <tr><td valign=top>

004:015<td>And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a
        nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which
        loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath
        born him. <tr><td valign=top>

004:016<td>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
        nurse unto it. <tr><td valign=top>

004:017<td>And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is
        a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the
        father of Jesse, the father of David. <tr><td valign=top>

004:018<td>Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron, <tr><td valign=top>

004:019<td>And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, <tr><td valign=top>

004:020<td>And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, <tr><td valign=top>

004:021<td>And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, <tr><td valign=top>

004:022<td>And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
