001:001 <td>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
        returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
        abode two days in Ziklag; <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
        came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and
        earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David,
        that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
        unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
        tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the
        battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and
        Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
        thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
        upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,
        lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
        And I answered, Here am I. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
        Amalekite. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
        me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole
        in me. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
        could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
        that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,
        and have brought them hither unto my lord. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and
        likewise all the men that were with him: <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
        and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and
        for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the
        sword. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art
        thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an
        Amalekite. <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
        forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed? <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and
        fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
        mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
        LORD's anointed. <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
        Jonathan his son: <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
        bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.) <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are
        the mighty fallen! <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;
        lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the
        daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
        be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the
        shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,
        as though he had not been anointed with oil. <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the
        bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul
        returned not empty. <tr><td valign=top>

001:023<td>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and
        in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
        eagles, they were stronger than lions. <tr><td valign=top>

001:024<td>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
        scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold
        upon your apparel. <tr><td valign=top>

001:025<td>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O
        Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. <tr><td valign=top>

001:026<td>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
        hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing
        the love of women. <tr><td valign=top>

001:027<td>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! <tr><td valign=top>

        shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron. <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
        over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the
        men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and
        said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed

        him. <tr><td valign=top>

        Judah have anointed me king over them. <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took
        Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and

002:010<td>Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to
        reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of
        Judah followed David. <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
        Judah was seven years and six months. <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the
        son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went
        out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat

        the other side of the pool. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
        before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. <tr><td valign=top>

        which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of
        the servants of David. <tr><td valign=top>

002:016<td>And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust
        his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
        wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in
        Gibeon. <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was
        beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David. <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
        and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe. <tr><td valign=top>

        thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take
        thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from
        following of him. <tr><td valign=top>

002:022<td>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
        me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then
        should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? <tr><td valign=top>

002:023<td>Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the
        hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that
        the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and
        died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as
        came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. <tr><td valign=top>

002:024<td>Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went
        down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth
        before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. <tr><td valign=top>

002:025<td>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
        after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an
        hill. <tr><td valign=top>

002:026<td>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour
        for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the
        latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people
        return from following their brethren? <tr><td valign=top>

002:027<td>And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely
        then in the morning the people had gone up every one from
        following his brother. <tr><td valign=top>

002:028<td>So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
        pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. <tr><td valign=top>

002:029<td>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
        and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they
        came to Mahanaim. <tr><td valign=top>

002:030<td>And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had
        gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's
        servants nineteen men and Asahel. <tr><td valign=top>

002:031<td>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of
        Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died. <tr><td valign=top>

002:032<td>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of
        his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went
        all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day. <tr><td valign=top>

003:002<td>And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was

003:006<td>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of
        Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
        for the house of Saul. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter

        gone in unto my father's concubine? <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and
        said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness
        this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,
        and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand
        of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning
        this woman? <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath
        sworn to David, even so I do to him; <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up
        the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even
        to Beersheba. <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
        him. <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,
        Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and,
        behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel
        unto thee. <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one
        thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,
        except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou
        comest to see my face. <tr><td valign=top>

003:014<td>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,
        Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an
        hundred foreskins of the Philistines. <tr><td valign=top>

003:015<td>And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
        Phaltiel the son of Laish. <tr><td valign=top>

003:016<td>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
        Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he
        returned. <tr><td valign=top>

003:017<td>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
        Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you: <tr><td valign=top>

003:018<td>Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By
        the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out

        their enemies. <tr><td valign=top>

003:019<td>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
        also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
        good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of
        Benjamin. <tr><td valign=top>

        gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a
        league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that
        thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went

        gone in peace. <tr><td valign=top>

003:023<td>When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they
        told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and
        he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. <tr><td valign=top>

003:024<td>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
        behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent
        him away, and he is quite gone? <tr><td valign=top>

003:025<td>Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive
        thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know
        all that thou doest. <tr><td valign=top>

003:026<td>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
        after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah:
        but David knew it not. <tr><td valign=top>

003:027<td>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in
        the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under
        the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his
        brother. <tr><td valign=top>

003:028<td>And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
        are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner
        the son of Ner: <tr><td valign=top>

003:029<td>Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's
        house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that
        hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,
        or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. <tr><td valign=top>

003:030<td>So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had
        slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. <tr><td valign=top>

003:031<td>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with
        him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
        before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier. <tr><td valign=top>

003:032<td>And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
        voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people
        wept. <tr><td valign=top>

003:033<td>And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
        fool dieth? <tr><td valign=top>

003:034<td>Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a
        man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the
        people wept again over him. <tr><td valign=top>

003:035<td>And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while
        it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more
        also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down. <tr><td valign=top>

003:036<td>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
        whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. <tr><td valign=top>

        was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. <tr><td valign=top>

        a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? <tr><td valign=top>

003:039<td>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men

        so? <tr><td valign=top>

        with him will I abide. <tr><td valign=top>

016:019<td>And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the

016:023<td>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those

017:008<td>For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that
        they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a

        men. <tr><td valign=top>

017:011<td>Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto

017:014<td>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
        Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.

        Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon
        Absalom. <tr><td valign=top>
