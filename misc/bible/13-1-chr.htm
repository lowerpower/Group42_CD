        LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for
        the building: <tr><td valign=top>

        house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked
        me to make me king over all Israel: <tr><td valign=top>

        the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for
        all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess
        this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your
        children after you for ever. <tr><td valign=top>

028:009<td>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
        serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for
