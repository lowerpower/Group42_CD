001:001 <td>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to
        pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in
        Shushan the palace, <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of
        Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
        which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the
        captivity there in the province are in great affliction and
        reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the
        gates thereof are burned with fire. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down
        and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed
        before the God of heaven, <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and
        terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
        love him and observe his commandments: <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou
        mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before
        thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy
        servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel,
        which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's
        house have sinned. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept
        the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which
        thou commandedst thy servant Moses. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
        servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you
        abroad among the nations: <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them;
        though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of
        the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring
        them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
        redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the
        prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who
        desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant
        this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I
        was the king's cupbearer. <tr><td valign=top>

        of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took
        up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been
        beforetime sad in his presence. <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
        seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of
        heart. Then I was very sore afraid, <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should
        not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my
        fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are
        consumed with fire? <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?
        So I prayed to the God of heaven. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
        servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest
        send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres,
        that I may build it. <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)
        For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?
        So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let
        letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that
        they may convey me over till I come into Judah; <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that
        he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the
        palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the
        city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king
        granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me. <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them
        the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army

        told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at
        Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast
        that I rode upon. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
        the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of
        Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were
        consumed with fire. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's
        pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me
        to pass. <tr><td valign=top>

002:015<td>Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
        and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so
        returned. <tr><td valign=top>

        had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to
        the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the
        work. <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how

        fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we
        be no more a reproach. <tr><td valign=top>

        said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their
        hands for this good work. <tr><td valign=top>

002:019<td>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
        Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to
        scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye
        do? will ye rebel against the king? <tr><td valign=top>

002:020<td>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven,
        he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and

        Jerusalem. <tr><td valign=top>

004:002<td>And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and

        revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are
        burned? <tr><td valign=top>

004:003<td>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that

004:004<td>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach

        captivity: <tr><td valign=top>

        Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that
        the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches
        began to be stopped, then they were very wroth, <tr><td valign=top>

004:008<td>And conspired all of them together to come and to fight
        against Jerusalem, and to hinder it. <tr><td valign=top>

004:009<td>Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
        against them day and night, because of them. <tr><td valign=top>

004:010<td>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
        decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to
        build the wall. <tr><td valign=top>

004:011<td>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
        till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause
        the work to cease. <tr><td valign=top>

004:012<td>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
        came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye
        shall return unto us they will be upon you. <tr><td valign=top>

004:013<td>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on
        the higher places, I even set the people after their families
        with their swords, their spears, and their bows. <tr><td valign=top>

004:014<td>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to
        the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of
        them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and
        fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your
        wives, and your houses. <tr><td valign=top>

004:015<td>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
        unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we
        returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work. <tr><td valign=top>

004:016<td>And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
        servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held
        both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the
        habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. <tr><td valign=top>

004:017<td>They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens,
        with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought
        in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. <tr><td valign=top>

004:018<td>For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side,
        and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me. <tr><td valign=top>

004:019<td>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest
        of the people, The work is great and large, and we are
        separated upon the wall, one far from another. <tr><td valign=top>

004:020<td>In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
        resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us. <tr><td valign=top>

004:021<td>So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears
        from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. <tr><td valign=top>

004:022<td>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every
        one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night
        they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day. <tr><td valign=top>

004:023<td>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of
        the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,
        saving that every one put them off for washing. <tr><td valign=top>

        against their brethren the Jews. <tr><td valign=top>

        many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and
        live. <tr><td valign=top>

005:003<td>Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
        vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the
        dearth. <tr><td valign=top>

005:005<td>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our
        children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our
        sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our
        daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in
        our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and
        vineyards. <tr><td valign=top>

005:006<td>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. <tr><td valign=top>

005:007<td>Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and
        the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of
        his brother. And I set a great assembly against them. <tr><td valign=top>

005:008<td>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
        brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will
        ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us?
        Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer. <tr><td valign=top>

005:009<td>Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk
        in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen
        our enemies? <tr><td valign=top>

005:010<td>I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of
        them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury. <tr><td valign=top>

005:011<td>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,
        their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the
        hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and
        the oil, that ye exact of them. <tr><td valign=top>

005:012<td>Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing
        of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
        priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do
        according to this promise. <tr><td valign=top>

005:013<td>Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
        his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this
