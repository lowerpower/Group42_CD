001:001 <td>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and
        that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and
        eschewed evil. <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
        thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five
        hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this
        man was the greatest of all the men of the east. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his
        day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
        drink with them. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone
        about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in
        the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
        number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have
        sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job
        continually. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
        answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the
        earth, and from walking up and down in it. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for
        nought? <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,
        and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed
        the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
        land. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and
        he will curse thee to thy face. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in
        thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So
        Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were
        eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
        plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they
        have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
        am escaped alone to tell thee. <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the
        sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
        escaped alone to tell thee. <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,
        and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with
        the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell
        thee. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in
        their eldest brother's house: <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and
        smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the
        young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to
        tell thee. <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
        fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
        shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken
        away; blessed be the name of the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>002:001 <td>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to
        present himself before the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And
        Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in
        the earth, and from walking up and down in it. <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and
        still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me
        against him, to destroy him without cause. <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
        that a man hath will he give for his life. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
        flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
        save his life. <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote
        Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he
        sat down among the ashes. <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
        integrity? curse God, and die. <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
        women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of
        God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job
        sin with his lips. <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
        come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz
        the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
        Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come
        to mourn with him and to comfort him. <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
        they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one
        his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
        nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his
        grief was very great. <tr><td valign=top>

003:002<td>And Job spake, and said, <tr><td valign=top>

003:003<td>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which
        it was said, There is a man child conceived. <tr><td valign=top>

        dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. <tr><td valign=top>

003:006<td>As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
        joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the
        number of the months. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come
        therein. <tr><td valign=top>

        up their mourning. <tr><td valign=top>

        light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the
        day: <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid
        sorrow from mine eyes. <tr><td valign=top>

        suck? <tr><td valign=top>
