        Elkoshite. <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth,
        and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his
        adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at
        all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind
        and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
        rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of
        Lebanon languisheth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth
        is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell
        therein. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
        fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and
        the rocks are thrown down by him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
        knoweth them that trust in him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the
        place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter
        end: affliction shall not rise up the second time. <tr><td valign=top>

        grave; for thou art vile. <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
        tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn

        through thee; he is utterly cut off. <tr><td valign=top>
