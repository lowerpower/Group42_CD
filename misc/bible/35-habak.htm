001:001 <td>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see. <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry
        out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save! <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold
        grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there
        are that raise up strife and contention. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go
        forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
        therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder
        marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will
        not believe, though it be told you. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
        nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to
        possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
        dignity shall proceed of themselves. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more
        fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall
        spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far;
        they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as
        the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the
        sand. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a
        scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they
        shall heap dust, and take it. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and
        offend, imputing this his power unto his god. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
        we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for
        judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for
        correction. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look
        on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
        treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked
        devoureth the man that is more righteous than he? <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping
        things, that have no ruler over them? <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in
        their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they
        rejoice and are glad. <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto
        their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their
        meat plenteous. <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare
        continually to slay the nations? <tr><td valign=top>

        ladeth himself with thick clay! <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the
        people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the

        therein. <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many
        people, and hast sinned against thy soul. <tr><td valign=top>

        the timber shall answer it. <tr><td valign=top>

        city by iniquity! <tr><td valign=top>

        labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves

        thy glory. <tr><td valign=top>

        revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the

        His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his
        praise. <tr><td valign=top>

        of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power. <tr><td valign=top>

        at his feet. <tr><td valign=top>

        the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the
        perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of
        the land of Midian did tremble. <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger
        against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou
        didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation? <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the
        tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with
        rivers. <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of
        the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up

        of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy
        glittering spear. <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst
        thresh the heathen in anger. <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
        salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of
        the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto
        the neck. Selah. <tr><td valign=top>

003:014<td>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his
        villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their
        rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly. <tr><td valign=top>

        voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in
        myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he
        cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his

        the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: <tr><td valign=top>
