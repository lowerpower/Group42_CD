001:001 <td>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
        the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by
        Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
        governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high
        priest, saying, <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The
        time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be
        built. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying, <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and
        this house lie waste? <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
        ways. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have
        not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye
        clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages
        earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house;
        and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith
        the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye
        brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of
        hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every
        man unto his own house. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the
        earth is stayed from her fruit. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
        mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon
        the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and
        upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
        hands. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
        Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
        obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of
        Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and
        the people did fear before the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message
        unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
        Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son
        of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
        remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house
        of the LORD of hosts, their God, <tr><td valign=top>

        month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai,
        saying, <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
        Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and
        to the residue of the people, saying, <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory?
        and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison
        of it as nothing? <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be
        strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be
        strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work:
        for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts: <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came
        out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little
        while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
        sea, and the dry land; <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
        shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the
        LORD of hosts. <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of
        hosts. <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the
        former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give
        peace, saith the LORD of hosts. <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the
        second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the
        prophet, saying, <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning
        the law, saying, <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with
        his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any
        meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch
        any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered
        and said, It shall be unclean. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is
        this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of
        their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean. <tr><td valign=top>

002:015<td>And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from
        before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the
        LORD: <tr><td valign=top>

002:016<td>Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty
        measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat
        for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but
        twenty. <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all
        the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the
        LORD. <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and
        twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the
        foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it. <tr><td valign=top>

002:019<td>Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig
        tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not

002:021<td>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake
        the heavens and the earth; <tr><td valign=top>

002:022<td>And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will
        destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I
        will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and
        the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the
        sword of his brother. <tr><td valign=top>

002:023<td>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O
        Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD,
        and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith
        the LORD of hosts.
