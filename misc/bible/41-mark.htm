001:001 <td>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger
        before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
        of the Lord, make his paths straight. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
        repentance for the remission of sins. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they
        of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of
        Jordan, confessing their sins. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a
        skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after
        me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down
        and unloose. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize
        you with the Holy Ghost. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from
        Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
        opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my
        beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of
        Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
        unto him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
        Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is
        at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
        Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were
        fishers. <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make
        you to become fishers of men. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the
        ship mending their nets. <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>And straightway he called them: and they left their father
        Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after
        him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath
        day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them
        as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. <tr><td valign=top>

001:023<td>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
        and he cried out, <tr><td valign=top>

001:024<td>Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
        of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
        art, the Holy One of God. <tr><td valign=top>

001:025<td>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
        him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:026<td>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a
        loud voice, he came out of him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:027<td>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
        themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is
        this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean
        spirits, and they do obey him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:028<td>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the
        region round about Galilee. <tr><td valign=top>

001:029<td>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
        entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and
        John. <tr><td valign=top>

001:030<td>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they
        tell him of her. <tr><td valign=top>

001:031<td>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
        immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. <tr><td valign=top>

001:032<td>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all
        that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. <tr><td valign=top>

001:033<td>And all the city was gathered together at the door. <tr><td valign=top>

001:034<td>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
        out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because
        they knew him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:035<td>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he
        went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
        prayed. <tr><td valign=top>

001:036<td>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:037<td>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek
        for thee. <tr><td valign=top>

001:038<td>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I
        may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:039<td>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee,
        and cast out devils. <tr><td valign=top>

001:040<td>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling
        down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst
        make me clean. <tr><td valign=top>

001:041<td>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and
        touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. <tr><td valign=top>

001:042<td>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
        from him, and he was cleansed. <tr><td valign=top>

001:043<td>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; <tr><td valign=top>

001:044<td>And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go
        thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy
        cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony
        unto them. <tr><td valign=top>

001:045<td>But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
        abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly
        enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and
        they came to him from every quarter. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>002:001 <td>And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it
        was noised that he was in the house. <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that
        there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about
        the door: and he preached the word unto them. <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which
        was borne of four. <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
        uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it
        up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the
        palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and
        reasoning in their hearts, <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins
        but God only? <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they
        so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason
        ye these things in your hearts? <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins
        be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and
        walk? <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
        to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way
        into thine house. <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth
        before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and
        glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
        resorted unto him, and he taught them. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting
        at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he
        arose and followed him. <tr><td valign=top>

002:015<td>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,
        many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and
        his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. <tr><td valign=top>

002:016<td>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans
        and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he
        eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole
        have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came
        not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast:
        and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John
        and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? <tr><td valign=top>

002:019<td>And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
        fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have
        the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. <tr><td valign=top>

002:020<td>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
        away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. <tr><td valign=top>

002:021<td>No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment:
        else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old,
        and the rent is made worse. <tr><td valign=top>

002:022<td>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new
        wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the
        bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new
        bottles. <tr><td valign=top>

002:023<td>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on
        the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to
        pluck the ears of corn. <tr><td valign=top>

002:024<td>And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
        sabbath day that which is not lawful? <tr><td valign=top>

002:025<td>And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when
        he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with
        him? <tr><td valign=top>

002:026<td>How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the
        high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to
        eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with
        him? <tr><td valign=top>

002:027<td>And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not
        man for the sabbath: <tr><td valign=top>

002:028<td>Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. <tr><td valign=top>

        day; that they might accuse him. <tr><td valign=top>

003:003<td>And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand
        forth. <tr><td valign=top>

003:004<td>And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
        days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held
        their peace. <tr><td valign=top>

003:005<td>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being
        grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the
        man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and
        his hand was restored whole as the other. <tr><td valign=top>

003:006<td>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel
        with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and
        a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea, <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan;
        and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they

003:009<td>And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait
        on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him
        for to touch him, as many as had plagues. <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him,
        and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. <tr><td valign=top>

        would: and they came unto him. <tr><td valign=top>

        Simon the Canaanite, <tr><td valign=top>

003:019<td>And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went
        into an house. <tr><td valign=top>

        not so much as eat bread. <tr><td valign=top>

        him: for they said, He is beside himself. <tr><td valign=top>

003:022<td>And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
        Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out
        devils. <tr><td valign=top>

003:023<td>And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables,
