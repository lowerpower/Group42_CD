001:001 <td>The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that
        Jesus began both to do and teach, <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through
        the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom
        he had chosen: <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
        infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking
        of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that
        they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
        promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
        with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him,
        saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom
        to Israel? <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or
        the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
        upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
        and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
        of the earth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
        taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. <tr><td valign=top>

        into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
        heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go
        into heaven. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called
        Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. <tr><td valign=top>

        Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. <tr><td valign=top>

        disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about

001:016<td>Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been
        fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake
        before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took
        Jesus. <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
        ministry. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity;
        and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all
        his bowels gushed out. <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch
        as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that
        is to say, The field of blood. <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
        desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let
        another take. <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the

001:022<td>Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he
        was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness
        with us of his resurrection. <tr><td valign=top>

001:023<td>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was
        surnamed Justus, and Matthias. <tr><td valign=top>

001:024<td>And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the
        hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, <tr><td valign=top>

001:025<td>That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from
        which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own
        place. <tr><td valign=top>

        Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. <tr><td valign=top>

        pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your

        visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in
        those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: <tr><td valign=top>

        blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come: <tr><td valign=top>

        name of the Lord shall be saved. <tr><td valign=top>

002:022<td>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
        approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs,
        which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves
        also know: <tr><td valign=top>

002:023<td>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
        foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have
        crucified and slain: <tr><td valign=top>

        because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. <tr><td valign=top>

        before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not
        be moved: <tr><td valign=top>

002:026<td>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
        moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: <tr><td valign=top>

002:027<td>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou
        suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. <tr><td valign=top>

        me full of joy with thy countenance. <tr><td valign=top>

002:029<td>Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the
        patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his
        sepulchre is with us unto this day. <tr><td valign=top>

002:030<td>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with
        an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to
        the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; <tr><td valign=top>

002:031<td>He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ,
        that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see
        corruption. <tr><td valign=top>

002:032<td>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. <tr><td valign=top>

002:033<td>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
        received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath
        shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. <tr><td valign=top>

002:034<td>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith
        himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right
        hand, <tr><td valign=top>

002:035<td>Until I make thy foes thy footstool. <tr><td valign=top>

002:036<td>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
        hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord
        and Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

002:037<td>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart,
        and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and
        brethren, what shall we do? <tr><td valign=top>

002:038<td>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
        of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
        and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. <tr><td valign=top>

002:039<td>For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
        that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall
        call. <tr><td valign=top>

002:040<td>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying,
        Save yourselves from this untoward generation. <tr><td valign=top>

002:041<td>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
        same day there were added unto them about three thousand
        souls. <tr><td valign=top>

        fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. <tr><td valign=top>

        done by the apostles. <tr><td valign=top>

002:044<td>And all that believed were together, and had all things
        common; <tr><td valign=top>

002:045<td>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all
        men, as every man had need. <tr><td valign=top>

002:046<td>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
        breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with
        gladness and singleness of heart, <tr><td valign=top>

002:047<td>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the
        Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. <tr><td valign=top>

        hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. <tr><td valign=top>

003:002<td>And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried,
        whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called
        Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; <tr><td valign=top>

003:003<td>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an
        alms. <tr><td valign=top>

        on us. <tr><td valign=top>

003:005<td>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
        them. <tr><td valign=top>

003:006<td>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I
        have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise
        up and walk. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and
        immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them
        into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>And all the people saw him walking and praising God: <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the
        Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder
        and amazement at that which had happened unto him. <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all
        the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called
        Solomon's, greatly wondering. <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of
        Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on
        us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this
        man to walk? <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
        fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up,
        and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was
        determined to let him go. <tr><td valign=top>

003:014<td>But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a
        murderer to be granted unto you; <tr><td valign=top>

003:015<td>And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the
        dead; whereof we are witnesses. <tr><td valign=top>

003:016<td>And his name through faith in his name hath made this man
        strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him
        hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
        all. <tr><td valign=top>

003:017<td>And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as
        did also your rulers. <tr><td valign=top>

003:018<td>But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of
        all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so

        perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they
        marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been
        with Jesus. <tr><td valign=top>

004:014<td>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them,
        they could say nothing against it. <tr><td valign=top>

        notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them
        that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. <tr><td valign=top>

004:017<td>But that it spread no further among the people, let us
        straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man
        in this name. <tr><td valign=top>

        heard. <tr><td valign=top>

004:021<td>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
        finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the
        people: for all men glorified God for that which was done. <tr><td valign=top>

        Puteoli: <tr><td valign=top>

028:014<td>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them
        seven days: and so we went toward Rome. <tr><td valign=top>

028:015<td>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
        meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom
        when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. <tr><td valign=top>

028:016<td>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the
        prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered
        to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. <tr><td valign=top>

028:017<td>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
        chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together,
        he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed
        nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was
        I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the
        Romans. <tr><td valign=top>

028:018<td>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
        there was no cause of death in me. <tr><td valign=top>

028:019<td>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to
        appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation
        of. <tr><td valign=top>

028:020<td>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you,
        and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I
        am bound with this chain. <tr><td valign=top>

028:021<td>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
        Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came
        shewed or spake any harm of thee. <tr><td valign=top>

028:022<td>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
        concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken
        against. <tr><td valign=top>

028:023<td>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
        into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the
        kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of
        the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till
        evening. <tr><td valign=top>

028:024<td>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
        believed not. <tr><td valign=top>

028:025<td>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed,
        after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost
        by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, <tr><td valign=top>

028:026<td>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,
        and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not
        perceive: <tr><td valign=top>

028:027<td>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears
        are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest
        they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
        understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I
        should heal them. <tr><td valign=top>

028:028<td>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
        sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. <tr><td valign=top>

028:029<td>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
        great reasoning among themselves. <tr><td valign=top>

028:030<td>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
        received all that came in unto him, <tr><td valign=top>

028:031<td>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
        concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man
        forbidding him.
