        Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus

001:008<td>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
        your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
        gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
        always in my prayers; <tr><td valign=top>

        prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. <tr><td valign=top>

        spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
        mutual faith both of you and me. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
        purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I
        might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
        Gentiles. <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
        the wise, and to the unwise. <tr><td valign=top>

        you that are at Rome also. <tr><td valign=top>

        ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
        unrighteousness; <tr><td valign=top>

        are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
        made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are
        without excuse: <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as
        God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their
        imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, <tr><td valign=top>

        made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted
        beasts, and creeping things. <tr><td valign=top>

001:024<td>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the
        lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies

        ever. Amen. <tr><td valign=top>

        their women did change the natural use into that which is
        against nature: <tr><td valign=top>

001:027<td>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the
        woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men
        working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves
        that recompence of their error which was meet. <tr><td valign=top>

001:028<td>And even as they did not like to retain God in their
        knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those
        things which are not convenient; <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we
        have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all
        under sin; <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
        after God. <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
        unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they
        have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: <tr><td valign=top>

003:018<td>There is no fear of God before their eyes. <tr><td valign=top>

003:019<td>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to
        them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped,
        and all the world may become guilty before God. <tr><td valign=top>

003:020<td>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
        justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of
        sin. <tr><td valign=top>

003:021<td>But now the righteousness of God without the law is
        manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; <tr><td valign=top>

003:022<td>Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
        Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is
        no difference: <tr><td valign=top>

003:023<td>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; <tr><td valign=top>

003:024<td>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
        that is in Christ Jesus: <tr><td valign=top>

003:025<td>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
        his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of
        sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; <tr><td valign=top>

        Nay: but by the law of faith. <tr><td valign=top>

        Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: <tr><td valign=top>

        faith, and uncircumcision through faith. <tr><td valign=top>

        to the flesh, hath found? <tr><td valign=top>

        glory; but not before God. <tr><td valign=top>

004:003<td>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
        counted unto him for righteousness. <tr><td valign=top>

        justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
        righteousness. <tr><td valign=top>

        whom God imputeth righteousness without works, <tr><td valign=top>

        uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. <tr><td valign=top>

004:011<td>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
        righteousness of the faith which he had yet being
        uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that
        believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness
        might be imputed unto them also: <tr><td valign=top>

004:012<td>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the

        faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet
        uncircumcised. <tr><td valign=top>

004:013<td>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was
        not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through
        the righteousness of faith. <tr><td valign=top>

004:014<td>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
        and the promise made of none effect: <tr><td valign=top>

004:015<td>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is
        no transgression. <tr><td valign=top>

004:016<td>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
        end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that
        only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the
        faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, <tr><td valign=top>

        saved by his life. <tr><td valign=top>

005:011<td>And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
        Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. <tr><td valign=top>

005:012<td>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
        by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
        sinned: <tr><td valign=top>

005:013<td>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not
        imputed when there is no law. <tr><td valign=top>

005:014<td>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
        that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
        transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. <tr><td valign=top>

005:015<td>But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if
        through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace
        of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus
        Christ, hath abounded unto many. <tr><td valign=top>

005:016<td>And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
        judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of
        many offences unto justification. <tr><td valign=top>

005:017<td>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more
        they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of
        righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) <tr><td valign=top>

005:018<td>Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men
