001:001 <td>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
        Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at
        Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia: <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the
        Lord Jesus Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
        Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able
        to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort
        wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
        consolation also aboundeth by Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
        salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same
        sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted,
        it is for your consolation and salvation. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are
        partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the
        consolation. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble
        which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure,
        above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should
        not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in
        whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
        bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be
        given by many on our behalf. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience,
        that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
        wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation
        in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
        acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your
        rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord
        Jesus. <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before,
        that ye might have a second benefit; <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of
        Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward
        Judaea. <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the
        things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,
        that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you
        by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and
        nay, but in him was yea. <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen,
        unto the glory of God by us. <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath
        anointed us, is God; <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit
        in our hearts. <tr><td valign=top>

001:023<td>Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare
        you I came not as yet unto Corinth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:024<td>Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers
        of your joy: for by faith ye stand. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>002:001 <td>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again
        to you in heaviness. <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad,
        but the same which is made sorry by me? <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should
        have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having
        confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto
        you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that
        ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in
        part: that I may not overcharge you all. <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was
        inflicted of many. <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and
        comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up
        with overmuch sorrow. <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
        him. <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof
        of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave
        any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it
        in the person of Christ; <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not
        ignorant of his devices. <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel,
        and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my
        brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into
        Macedonia. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
        Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us
        in every place. <tr><td valign=top>

002:015<td>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
        saved, and in them that perish: <tr><td valign=top>

002:016<td>To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the
        other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for
        these things? <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as
        of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in
        Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>003:001 <td>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
        others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of
        commendation from you? <tr><td valign=top>

003:002<td>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of
        all men: <tr><td valign=top>

003:003<td>Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of
        Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
        Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in
        fleshy tables of the heart. <tr><td valign=top>

003:004<td>And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: <tr><td valign=top>

003:005<td>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as
        of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; <tr><td valign=top>

003:006<td>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not
        of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but
        the spirit giveth life. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in
        stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not
        stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his
        countenance; which glory was to be done away: <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather
        glorious? <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more
        doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
        respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that
        which remaineth is glorious. <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
        speech: <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the
        children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of
        that which is abolished: <tr><td valign=top>

003:014<td>But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the
        same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament;
        which vail is done away in Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

003:015<td>But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
        their heart. <tr><td valign=top>

003:016<td>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
        taken away. <tr><td valign=top>

003:017<td>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord
        is, there is liberty. <tr><td valign=top>

003:018<td>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
        of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to
        glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>004:001 <td>Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
        mercy, we faint not; <tr><td valign=top>

004:002<td>But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not
        walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God
        deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending
        ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. <tr><td valign=top>

004:003<td>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: <tr><td valign=top>

004:004<td>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them
        which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of
        Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. <tr><td valign=top>

004:005<td>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
        ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. <tr><td valign=top>

004:006<td>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
        hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
        of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

004:007<td>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
        excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. <tr><td valign=top>

004:008<td>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
        perplexed, but not in despair; <tr><td valign=top>

004:009<td>Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; <tr><td valign=top>

004:010<td>Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
        that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our
        body. <tr><td valign=top>

004:011<td>For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus'
        sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in
        our mortal flesh. <tr><td valign=top>

004:012<td>So then death worketh in us, but life in you. <tr><td valign=top>

004:013<td>We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is
        written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also
        believe, and therefore speak; <tr><td valign=top>

        us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. <tr><td valign=top>

        might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of
        God. <tr><td valign=top>

004:016<td>For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man
        perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. <tr><td valign=top>

004:017<td>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
        for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; <tr><td valign=top>

004:018<td>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
        things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are
        temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>005:001 <td>For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
        dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with
        hands, eternal in the heavens. <tr><td valign=top>

005:002<td>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
        with our house which is from heaven: <tr><td valign=top>

005:003<td>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. <tr><td valign=top>

005:004<td>For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened:
        not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that
        mortality might be swallowed up of life. <tr><td valign=top>

005:005<td>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who
        also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. <tr><td valign=top>

005:006<td>Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are
        at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: <tr><td valign=top>

005:007<td>(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) <tr><td valign=top>

005:008<td>We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from
        the body, and to be present with the Lord. <tr><td valign=top>

005:009<td>Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may
        be accepted of him. <tr><td valign=top>

005:010<td>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
        that every one may receive the things done in his body,
        according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. <tr><td valign=top>

005:011<td>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but
        we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made
        manifest in your consciences. <tr><td valign=top>

005:012<td>For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you
        occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to
        answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. <tr><td valign=top>

005:013<td>For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether
        we be sober, it is for your cause. <tr><td valign=top>

005:014<td>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
        that if one died for all, then were all dead: <tr><td valign=top>

005:015<td>And that he died for all, that they which live should not
        henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
        them, and rose again. <tr><td valign=top>

005:016<td>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea,
        though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now
        henceforth know we him no more. <tr><td valign=top>

005:017<td>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old
        things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. <tr><td valign=top>

005:018<td>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself

        himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
        committed unto us the word of reconciliation. <tr><td valign=top>
