001:001 <td>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
        saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops
        and deacons: <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from
        the Lord Jesus Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with
        joy, <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until
        now; <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a
        good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
        Christ: <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I
        have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the
        defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers
        of my grace. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
        bowels of Jesus Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more
        in knowledge and in all judgment; <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be
        sincere and without offence till the day of Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by
        Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things
        which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the
        furtherance of the gospel; <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and
        in all other places; <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my
        bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some
        also of good will: <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing
        to add affliction to my bonds: <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence
        of the gospel. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or
        in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea,
        and will rejoice. <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
        prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in
        nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as
        always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body,
        whether it be by life, or by death. <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour:
        yet what I shall choose I wot not. <tr><td valign=top>

001:023<td>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
        and to be with Christ; which is far better: <tr><td valign=top>

001:024<td>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. <tr><td valign=top>

001:025<td>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and
        continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; <tr><td valign=top>

001:026<td>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for
        me by my coming to you again. <tr><td valign=top>

001:027<td>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
        Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I
        may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit,
        with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; <tr><td valign=top>

001:028<td>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them
        an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and
        that of God. <tr><td valign=top>

001:029<td>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
        believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; <tr><td valign=top>

001:030<td>Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to
        be in me. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>002:001 <td>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any
        comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
        bowels and mercies, <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,
        being of one accord, of one mind. <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in
        lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than
        themselves. <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on
        the things of others. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
        equal with God: <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
        of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
        became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
        name which is above every name: <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in
        heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
        Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
        presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your
        own salvation with fear and trembling. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
        his good pleasure. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>Do all things without murmurings and disputings: <tr><td valign=top>

002:015<td>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God,
        without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
        among whom ye shine as lights in the world; <tr><td valign=top>

002:016<td>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day
        of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in
        vain. <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of
        your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. <tr><td valign=top>

002:019<td>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto
        you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your
        state. <tr><td valign=top>

002:020<td>For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
        state. <tr><td valign=top>

002:021<td>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
        Christ's. <tr><td valign=top>

002:022<td>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father,
        he hath served with me in the gospel. <tr><td valign=top>

002:023<td>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see
        how it will go with me. <tr><td valign=top>

002:024<td>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. <tr><td valign=top>

002:025<td>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
        brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your
        messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. <tr><td valign=top>

002:026<td>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness,
        because that ye had heard that he had been sick. <tr><td valign=top>

002:027<td>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on
        him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have
        sorrow upon sorrow. <tr><td valign=top>

002:028<td>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
        again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. <tr><td valign=top>

002:029<td>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
        such in reputation: <tr><td valign=top>

002:030<td>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not
        regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>003:001 <td>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
        things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is
        safe. <tr><td valign=top>

003:002<td>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the
        concision. <tr><td valign=top>

003:003<td>For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit,
        and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the
        flesh. <tr><td valign=top>

003:004<td>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other
        man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh,
        I more: <tr><td valign=top>

003:005<td>Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the
        tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the
        law, a Pharisee; <tr><td valign=top>

003:006<td>Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
        righteousness which is in the law, blameless. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
        Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
        excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom
        I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but
        dung, that I may win Christ, <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which
        is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,
        the righteousness which is of God by faith: <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
        the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto
        his death; <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the
        dead. <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>Not as though I had already attained, either were already
        perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for
        which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
        thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
        reaching forth unto those things which are before, <tr><td valign=top>

003:014<td>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of
        God in Christ Jesus. <tr><td valign=top>

003:015<td>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and
        if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
        this unto you. <tr><td valign=top>

003:016<td>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
        the same rule, let us mind the same thing. <tr><td valign=top>

003:017<td>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which
        walk so as ye have us for an ensample. <tr><td valign=top>

003:018<td>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
        you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of
        Christ: <tr><td valign=top>

        things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
        things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
        things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if
        there be any praise, think on these things. <tr><td valign=top>

004:009<td>Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and
        heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with
        you. <tr><td valign=top>

004:010<td>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your

        where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to
        be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. <tr><td valign=top>

004:013<td>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. <tr><td valign=top>

004:014<td>Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate
        with my affliction. <tr><td valign=top>

004:015<td>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
        gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated
        with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. <tr><td valign=top>

        abound to your account. <tr><td valign=top>

        Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of
        a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. <tr><td valign=top>
