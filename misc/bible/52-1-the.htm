001:001 <td>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
        Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus
        Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and
        the Lord Jesus Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of
        you in our prayers; <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of
        love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
        sight of God and our Father; <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in
        power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye
        know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having
        received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy
        Ghost. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
        Achaia. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
        Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to
        God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any
        thing. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we
        had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the
        living and true God; <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
        dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>002:001 <td>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
        it was not in vain: <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>But even after that we had suffered before, and were
        shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in
        our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much
        contention. <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor
        in guile: <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the
        gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which
        trieth our hearts. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know,
        nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness: <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others,
        when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
        children: <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to
        have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also
        our own souls, because ye were dear unto us. <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for
        labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable
        unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
        unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe: <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one
        of you, as a father doth his children, <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his
        kingdom and glory. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
        when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye
        received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the
        word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
        believe. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God
        which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered
        like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the
        Jews: <tr><td valign=top>

002:015<td>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and
        have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary
        to all men: <tr><td valign=top>

002:016<td>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be
        saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon
        them to the uttermost. <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
        presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see
        your face with great desire. <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
        again; but Satan hindered us. <tr><td valign=top>

002:019<td>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not
        even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his
        coming? <tr><td valign=top>

002:020<td>For ye are our glory and joy. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>003:001 <td>Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good
        to be left at Athens alone; <tr><td valign=top>

003:002<td>And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
        fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and
        to comfort you concerning your faith: <tr><td valign=top>

003:003<td>That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for
        yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. <tr><td valign=top>

003:004<td>For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
        should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye
        know. <tr><td valign=top>

003:005<td>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
        your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you,
        and our labour be in vain. <tr><td valign=top>

003:006<td>But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us
        good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good
        remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we
        also to see you: <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
        affliction and distress by your faith: <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all
        the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face,
        and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
        direct our way unto you. <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one
        toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness
        before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
        Christ with all his saints. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>004:001 <td>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by
        the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to
        walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more. <tr><td valign=top>

004:002<td>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. <tr><td valign=top>

004:003<td>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
        should abstain from fornication: <tr><td valign=top>

004:004<td>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
        sanctification and honour; <tr><td valign=top>

004:005<td>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
        know not God: <tr><td valign=top>

004:006<td>That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter:
        because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also
        have forewarned you and testified. <tr><td valign=top>

004:007<td>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto
        holiness. <tr><td valign=top>

004:008<td>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
        hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. <tr><td valign=top>

004:009<td>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
        you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. <tr><td valign=top>

004:010<td>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
        Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more
        and more; <tr><td valign=top>

004:011<td>And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
        and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; <tr><td valign=top>

004:012<td>That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
        that ye may have lack of nothing. <tr><td valign=top>

        them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others
        which have no hope. <tr><td valign=top>

004:014<td>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
        also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. <tr><td valign=top>

004:015<td>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
        which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
        not prevent them which are asleep. <tr><td valign=top>

004:016<td>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
        with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God:
        and the dead in Christ shall rise first: <tr><td valign=top>

004:017<td>Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
        with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so

        cometh as a thief in the night. <tr><td valign=top>

        destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with

        we are not of the night, nor of darkness. <tr><td valign=top>
