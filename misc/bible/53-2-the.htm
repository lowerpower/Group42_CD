001:001 <td>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
        Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
        Jesus Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is
        meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the
        charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for
        your patience and faith in all your persecutions and
        tribulations that ye endure: <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
        that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
        ye also suffer: <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
        tribulation to them that trouble you; <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
        shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God,
        and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
        presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
        admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among
        you was believed) in that day. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would
        count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good
        pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power: <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in
        you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the
        Lord Jesus Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

        Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, <tr><td valign=top>

002:002<td>That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by
        spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day
        of Christ is at hand. <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not
        come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of
        sin be revealed, the son of perdition; <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
        God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the
        temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you
        these things? <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in
        his time. <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
        letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
        consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with
        the brightness of his coming: <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all
        power and signs and lying wonders, <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that
        perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that
        they might be saved. <tr><td valign=top>

        they should believe a lie: <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but
        had pleasure in unrighteousness. <tr><td valign=top>

002:013<td>But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
        beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
        chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit
        and belief of the truth: <tr><td valign=top>

        ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. <tr><td valign=top>

        have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: <tr><td valign=top>

003:002<td>And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men:
        for all men have not faith. <tr><td valign=top>

        the patient waiting for Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

        Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that
        walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he
        received of us. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved
        not ourselves disorderly among you; <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought
        with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be
        chargeable to any of you: <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an
        ensample unto you to follow us. <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if
        any would not work, neither should he eat. <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>For we hear that there are some which walk among you
        disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
        Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own
        bread. <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing. <tr><td valign=top>

003:014<td>And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
        man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. <tr><td valign=top>

003:015<td>Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. <tr><td valign=top>

003:016<td>Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all
        means. The Lord be with you all. <tr><td valign=top>

003:017<td>The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
        in every epistle: so I write. <tr><td valign=top>

003:018<td>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
