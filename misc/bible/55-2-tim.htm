        my prayers night and day; <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that
        I may be filled with joy; <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in
        thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy
        mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. <tr><td valign=top>

        of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
        nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the
        afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not
        according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
        grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
        began, <tr><td valign=top>

        and found me. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
        that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at

        from the dead according to my gospel: <tr><td valign=top>

        the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to
        the subverting of the hearers. <tr><td valign=top>

        needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <tr><td valign=top>
