001:001 <td>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother,
        unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier,
        and to the church in thy house: <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
        Jesus Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
        Jesus, and toward all saints; <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by
        the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in
        Christ Jesus. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
        bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin
        thee that which is convenient, <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one
        as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
        bonds: <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
        profitable to thee and to me: <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
        mine own bowels: <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might
        have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
        should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
        shouldest receive him for ever; <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
        specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the
        flesh, and in the Lord? <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
        account; <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it:
        albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine
        own self besides. <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
        bowels in the Lord. <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
        that thou wilt also do more than I say. <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
        your prayers I shall be given unto you. <tr><td valign=top>

001:023<td>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; <tr><td valign=top>

001:024<td>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. <tr><td valign=top>

001:025<td>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
