        past unto the fathers by the prophets, <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
        hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
        worlds; <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image
        of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his
        power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the
        right hand of the Majesty on high: <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by
        inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my
        Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to
        him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the
        world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and
        his ministers a flame of fire. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
        ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy
        kingdom. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
        God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
        above thy fellows. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of
        the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax
        old as doth a garment; <tr><td valign=top>

        changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my
        right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? <tr><td valign=top>

        for them who shall be heirs of salvation? <tr><td valign=top>

        transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of
        reward; <tr><td valign=top>

002:003<td>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
        at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
        unto us by them that heard him; <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders,
        and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
        according to his own will? <tr><td valign=top>

002:005<td>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to
        come, whereof we speak. <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
        that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou
        visitest him? <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst
        him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of
        thy hands: <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in
        that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that
        is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put
        under him. <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
        for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour;
        that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are
        all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
        captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are
        all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
        brethren, <tr><td valign=top>

        of the church will I sing praise unto thee. <tr><td valign=top>

        the children which God hath given me. <tr><td valign=top>

002:014<td>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
        blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
        through death he might destroy him that had the power of
        death, that is, the devil; <tr><td valign=top>

002:015<td>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
        lifetime subject to bondage. <tr><td valign=top>

002:016<td>For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
        took on him the seed of Abraham. <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
        his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
        priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for
        the sins of the people. <tr><td valign=top>

        consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ
        Jesus; <tr><td valign=top>

003:002<td>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
        faithful in all his house. <tr><td valign=top>

        inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour
        than the house. <tr><td valign=top>

003:004<td>For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
        things is God. <tr><td valign=top>

        for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; <tr><td valign=top>

003:006<td>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if
        we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm
        unto the end. <tr><td valign=top>

003:007<td>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his
        voice, <tr><td valign=top>

003:008<td>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
        temptation in the wilderness: <tr><td valign=top>

003:009<td>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works
        forty years. <tr><td valign=top>

003:010<td>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They
        do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) <tr><td valign=top>

003:012<td>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart
        of unbelief, in departing from the living God. <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest
        any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. <tr><td valign=top>

003:014<td>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning
        of our confidence stedfast unto the end; <tr><td valign=top>

003:015<td>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
        your hearts, as in the provocation. <tr><td valign=top>

003:016<td>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all
        that came out of Egypt by Moses. <tr><td valign=top>

003:017<td>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them
        that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? <tr><td valign=top>

003:018<td>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest,
        but to them that believed not? <tr><td valign=top>

003:019<td>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>004:001 <td>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of
        entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short
        of it. <tr><td valign=top>

004:002<td>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but
        the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
        faith in them that heard it. <tr><td valign=top>

004:003<td>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As
        I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest:
        although the works were finished from the foundation of the
        world. <tr><td valign=top>

004:004<td>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this
        wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. <tr><td valign=top>

004:005<td>And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. <tr><td valign=top>

004:006<td>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
        and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because
        of unbelief: <tr><td valign=top>

004:007<td>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day,
        after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear
        his voice, harden not your hearts. <tr><td valign=top>

004:008<td>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward
        have spoken of another day. <tr><td valign=top>

004:009<td>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. <tr><td valign=top>

004:010<td>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from
        his own works, as God did from his. <tr><td valign=top>

004:011<td>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
        fall after the same example of unbelief. <tr><td valign=top>

004:012<td>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
        any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of
        soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a
        discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <tr><td valign=top>

004:013<td>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
        sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of
        him with whom we have to do. <tr><td valign=top>

004:014<td>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
        into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
        profession. <tr><td valign=top>

004:015<td>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
        the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted
        like as we are, yet without sin. <tr><td valign=top>

004:016<td>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
        may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>005:001 <td>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men
        in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and
        sacrifices for sins: <tr><td valign=top>

005:002<td>Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
        out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with
        infirmity. <tr><td valign=top>

005:003<td>And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
        himself, to offer for sins. <tr><td valign=top>

005:004<td>And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
        called of God, as was Aaron. <tr><td valign=top>

005:005<td>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high
        priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day
        have I begotten thee. <tr><td valign=top>

005:006<td>As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
        after the order of Melchisedec. <tr><td valign=top>

005:007<td>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
        and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that
        was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he
        feared; <tr><td valign=top>

005:008<td>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
        which he suffered; <tr><td valign=top>

005:009<td>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
        salvation unto all them that obey him; <tr><td valign=top>

005:010<td>Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. <tr><td valign=top>

005:011<td>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
        seeing ye are dull of hearing. <tr><td valign=top>

005:012<td>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
        that one teach you again which be the first principles of the
        oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and
        not of strong meat. <tr><td valign=top>

005:013<td>For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
        righteousness: for he is a babe. <tr><td valign=top>

005:014<td>But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
        those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to
        discern both good and evil. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>006:001 <td>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
        let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation
        of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, <tr><td valign=top>

006:002<td>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of
        resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. <tr><td valign=top>

006:003<td>And this will we do, if God permit. <tr><td valign=top>

006:004<td>For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and
        have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of
        the Holy Ghost, <tr><td valign=top>

006:005<td>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
        world to come, <tr><td valign=top>

006:006<td>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance;
        seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and
        put him to an open shame. <tr><td valign=top>

006:007<td>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon
        it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is
        dressed, receiveth blessing from God: <tr><td valign=top>

006:008<td>But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is
        nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. <tr><td valign=top>

006:009<td>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and
        things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. <tr><td valign=top>

006:010<td>For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of
        love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have

006:012<td>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through
        faith and patience inherit the promises. <tr><td valign=top>

006:013<td>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear
        by no greater, he sware by himself, <tr><td valign=top>

006:014<td>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I
        will multiply thee. <tr><td valign=top>

006:015<td>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the
        promise. <tr><td valign=top>

006:016<td>For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for
        confirmation is to them an end of all strife. <tr><td valign=top>

006:017<td>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
        promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an
        oath: <tr><td valign=top>

006:018<td>That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for
        God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled
        for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: <tr><td valign=top>

        high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. <tr><td valign=top>

</table><hr noshade><table><td valign=top>007:001 <td>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high
        God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the
        kings, and blessed him; <tr><td valign=top>

007:002<td>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
        interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King
        of Salem, which is, King of peace; <tr><td valign=top>

007:003<td>Without father, without mother, without descent, having
        neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto

007:004<td>Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the

        office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of
        the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren,
        though they come out of the loins of Abraham: <tr><td valign=top>

007:009<td>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed
        tithes in Abraham. <tr><td valign=top>

        met him. <tr><td valign=top>

        under it the people received the law,) what further need was
        there that another priest should rise after the order of
        Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? <tr><td valign=top>

007:012<td>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a
        change also of the law. <tr><td valign=top>

        tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. <tr><td valign=top>

007:014<td>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which
        tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. <tr><td valign=top>

007:015<td>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude
        of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, <tr><td valign=top>

007:016<td>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but
        after the power of an endless life. <tr><td valign=top>

007:017<td>For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order
        of Melchisedec. <tr><td valign=top>

007:018<td>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
        before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. <tr><td valign=top>

007:019<td>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a
        better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. <tr><td valign=top>

007:020<td>And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: <tr><td valign=top>

007:021<td>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an
        oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not
        repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
        Melchisedec:) <tr><td valign=top>
