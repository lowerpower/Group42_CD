001:001 <td>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
        twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
        temptations; <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
        and entire, wanting nothing. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
        all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
        him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
        wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
        tossed. <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of
        the Lord. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of
        the grass he shall pass away. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
        withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the
        grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich
        man fade away in his ways. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
        tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
        promised to them that love him. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for
        God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
        lust, and enticed. <tr><td valign=top>

001:015<td>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,
        when it is finished, bringeth forth death. <tr><td valign=top>

001:016<td>Do not err, my beloved brethren. <tr><td valign=top>

001:017<td>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
        cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
        variableness, neither shadow of turning. <tr><td valign=top>

001:018<td>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
        should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. <tr><td valign=top>

001:019<td>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
        hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: <tr><td valign=top>

001:020<td>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. <tr><td valign=top>

001:021<td>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
        naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word,
        which is able to save your souls. <tr><td valign=top>

001:022<td>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
        your own selves. <tr><td valign=top>

001:023<td>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
        unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: <tr><td valign=top>

001:024<td>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
        forgetteth what manner of man he was. <tr><td valign=top>

001:025<td>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and
        continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
        doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. <tr><td valign=top>

001:026<td>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
        his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion
        is vain. <tr><td valign=top>

001:027<td>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
        To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
        keep himself unspotted from the world. <tr><td valign=top>

        Lord of glory, with respect of persons. <tr><td valign=top>

        poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: <tr><td valign=top>

002:004<td>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges
        of evil thoughts? <tr><td valign=top>

        this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he
        hath promised to them that love him? <tr><td valign=top>

002:006<td>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you,
        and draw you before the judgment seats? <tr><td valign=top>

002:007<td>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are
        called? <tr><td valign=top>

002:008<td>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou
        shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: <tr><td valign=top>

002:009<td>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are
        convinced of the law as transgressors. <tr><td valign=top>

002:010<td>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
        point, he is guilty of all. <tr><td valign=top>

002:011<td>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
        kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou
        art become a transgressor of the law. <tr><td valign=top>

002:012<td>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
        law of liberty. <tr><td valign=top>

        mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. <tr><td valign=top>

        faith, and have not works? can faith save him? <tr><td valign=top>

002:017<td>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. <tr><td valign=top>

002:018<td>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
        thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by
        my works. <tr><td valign=top>

002:019<td>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
        devils also believe, and tremble. <tr><td valign=top>

002:020<td>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is
        dead? <tr><td valign=top>

002:021<td>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
        offered Isaac his son upon the altar? <tr><td valign=top>

002:022<td>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was
        faith made perfect? <tr><td valign=top>

002:023<td>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
        God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was
        called the Friend of God. <tr><td valign=top>

002:024<td>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
        faith only. <tr><td valign=top>

        when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out
