        ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and

        God. <tr><td valign=top>

002:021<td>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
        for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
        steps: <tr><td valign=top>

002:022<td>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: <tr><td valign=top>

        contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called,
        that ye should inherit a blessing. <tr><td valign=top>

        his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: <tr><td valign=top>

003:011<td>Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
        ensue it. <tr><td valign=top>

003:013<td>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
        which is good? <tr><td valign=top>

003:014<td>But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye:
        and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; <tr><td valign=top>

003:015<td>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
        to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the
        hope that is in you with meekness and fear: <tr><td valign=top>

003:016<td>Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
        you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
        your good conversation in Christ. <tr><td valign=top>

003:017<td>For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
        well doing, than for evil doing. <tr><td valign=top>

003:018<td>For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
        unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in
        the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: <tr><td valign=top>

003:019<td>By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; <tr><td valign=top>

004:002<td>That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the
        flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. <tr><td valign=top>

004:003<td>For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought
        the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
        lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable
        idolatries: <tr><td valign=top>

004:004<td>Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the
        same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: <tr><td valign=top>

004:005<td>Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick
