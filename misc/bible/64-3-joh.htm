001:001 <td>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the
        truth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
        be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified
        of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the
        truth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
        truth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
        brethren, and to strangers; <tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church:
        whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly
        sort, thou shalt do well: <tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td>Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking
        nothing of the Gentiles. <tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be
        fellowhelpers to the truth. <tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have
        the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he
        doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not
        content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the
        brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out
        of the church. <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is
        good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil
        hath not seen God. <tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td>Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth
        itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our
        record is true. <tr><td valign=top>

001:013<td>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen
        write unto thee: <tr><td valign=top>

001:014<td>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face
        to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the
        friends by name.
