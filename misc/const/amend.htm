<P>[Editorial note: There is some conflict as to the exact dates of
ratification of the amendments by the several States. In some
cases, the resolutions of ratification were signed by the
officers of the legislatures on dates subsequent to that on which
the second house had acted. In other cases, the Governors of
several of the States "approved" the resolutions (on a
subsequent date), although action by the Governor is not
contemplated by article V, which required ratification by the
legislatures (or conventions) only. In a number of cases, the
journals of the State legislatures are not available. The dates
set out in this document are based upon the best information
available.]
