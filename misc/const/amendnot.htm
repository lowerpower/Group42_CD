<P>PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE <A HREF = 
"constitu.htm">CONSTITUTION</A>
NOT RATIFIED BY THE STATES

<P>During the course of our history, in addition to the <A HREF = 
"amend.htm"> 27 amendments</A> that have been
ratified by the required three-fourths of the States, six other 
amendments have been submitted to the States but have not been ratified 
by them.

<P>Beginning with the proposed Eighteenth Amendment, Congress has
customarily included a provision requiring ratification within
seven years from the time of the submission to the States. The
Supreme Court in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939), declared
that the question of the reasonableness of the time within which
a sufficient number of States must act is a political question to
be determined by the Congress.

<P>In 1789, twelve proposed articles of amendment were submitted to
the States. Of these, Articles III through XII were ratified and became
the first ten amendments to the Constitution, popularly known as
the Bill of Rights. In 1992, proposed Article II was ratified and
became the 27th amendment to the Constitution. Proposed Article I
which was not ratified is as follows:

<P>"Article the first

<P>"After the first enumeration required by the first article of
the Constitution, there shall be one Representative for every
thirty thousand, until the number shall amount to one hundred,
after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress,
that there shall be not less than one hundred Representatives,
nor less than one Representative for every forty thousand
persons, until the number of Representatives shall amount to two
hundred; after which the proportion shall be so regulated by
Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred
Representatives, nor more than one Representative for every fifty
thousand persons.''


<P>Thereafter, in the 2d session of the Eleventh Congress, the
Congress proposed the following article of amendment to the
Constitution relating to acceptance by citizens of the United
States of titles of nobility from any foreign government.

<P>The proposed amendment, which was not ratified by three-fourths
of the States, is as follows:

<P>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, two thirds of both
houses concurring, That the following section be submitted to the
legislatures of the several states, which, when ratified by the
legislatures of three fourths of the states, shall be valid and
binding, as a part of the constitution of the United States.

<P>If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive
or retain any title of nobility or honour, or shall, without the
consent of Congress, accept and retain any present, pension,
office or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king,
prince or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen
of the United States, and shall be incapable of holding any
office of trust or profit under them, or either of them.


<P>The following amendment to the Constitution relating to slavery
was proposed by the 2d session of the Thirty-sixth Congress on
March 2, 1861, when it passed the Senate, having previously
passed the House on February 28, 1861. It is interesting to note
in this connection that this is the only proposed (and not
ratified) amendment to the Constitution to have been signed by
the President. The President's signature is considered unnecessary because of the constitutional 
provision that on the concurrence of two-thirds of both Houses of 
Congress the proposal shall be submitted to the States for ratification.

<P>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the following
article be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States as
an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which,
when ratified by three-fourths of said Legislatures, shall be
valid, to all intents and purposes, as part of the said
Constitution, viz:

<P>"Article Thirteen

<P>"No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will
authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere,
within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof,
including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of
said State.''


<P>A child labor amendment was proposed by the 1st session of the
Sixty-eighth Congress on June 2, 1926, when it passed the Senate,
having previously passed the House on April 26, 1926. The
proposed amendment, which has been ratified by 28 States, to
date, is as follows:

<P>Joint Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States

<P>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House
concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an
amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which, when
ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several
States, shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part of
the Constitution:

<P>"Article--.

<P>"Section 1. The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate,
and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age.

<P>"Section 2. The power of the several States is unimpaired by
this article except that the operation of State laws shall be
suspended to the extent necessary to give effect to legislation
enacted by the Congress.''


<P>An amendment relative to equal rights for men and women was
proposed by the 2d session of the Ninety-second Congress on March
22, 1972, when it passed the Senate, having previously passed the
House on October 12, 1971. The seven-year deadline for
ratification of the proposed amendment was extended to June 30,
1982, by the 2d session of the Ninety-fifth Congress. The
proposed amendment, which was not ratified by three-fourths of
the States by June 30, 1982, is as follows:

<P>Joint Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States Relative to Equal Rights for Men and Women

<P>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House
concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an
amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall
be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution
when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several
States within seven years from the date of its submission by the
Congress:

<P>"Article--

<P>"Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied
or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of
sex.

<P>"Section. 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by
appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.

<P>"Section. 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the
date of ratification.''


<P>An amendment relative to voting rights for the District of
Columbia was proposed by the 2d session of the Ninety-fifth
Congress on August 22, 1978, when it passed the Senate, having
previously passed the House on March 2, 1978. The proposed
amendment, which was not ratified by three-fourths of the States
within the specified seven-year period, is as follows:

<P>Joint Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution To
Provide for Representation of the District of Columbia in the
Congress.

<P>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House
concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an
amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall
be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution
when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several
States within seven years from the date of its submission by the
Congress:

<P>"Article--

<P>"Section 1. For purposes of representation in the Congress,
election of the President and Vice President, and article V of
this Constitution, the District constituting the seat of
government of the United States shall be treated as though it
were a State.

<P>"Section. 2. The exercise of the rights and powers conferred under
this article shall be by the people of the District constituting
the seat of government, and as shall be provided by the Congress.

<P>"Section. 3. The twenty-third article of amendment to the
Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.

<P>"Section. 4. This article shall be inoperative, unless it shall have
been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the
legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven
years from the date of its submission.''
