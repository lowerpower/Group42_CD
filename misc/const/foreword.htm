<H2>FOREWORD</H2>

<P>By Hon. Jack Brooks, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary of the
House of Representatives.

<P>For over 200 years, the <A HREF = 
"constitu.htm">Constitution</A> has served
as the
cornerstone of our Nation's democracy and the principal guarantor
of freedom and equality for all Americans. Yet, as important as
these functions are, this remarkable document performs a perhaps
even more vital role as a visible and enduring common bond
between the diverse people of this great Nation. Thus, in light
of our recent celebration of the bicentennial of the Bill of
Rights, it is particularly appropriate that the House of
Representatives issues this pamphlet edition of the Constitution.

<P>The genius of the Founding Fathers is reflected in the intricate
set of checks and balances the Constitution builds into our
system of government. By preventing any one of the three branches
from acquiring dominance over the others, these structural and
procedural safeguards have preserved a fundamental, albeit not
always neat, separation of powers. Moreover, although developed
over two centuries ago, they continue to perform this essential
function despite the dramatic societal, technological, economic,
and political changes in the United States over the past two
centuries. The Framers made the conscious decision of choosing
constitutional generality over the overly specific civil codes of
the European nations. By so doing, they wisely built in a
flexibility to accommodate change so that a living instrument of
government could be passed down to succeeding generations.

<P>Just as important as the governmental structure established by
Articles I through VII of the Constitution are the personal
freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and the 13th, 14th, and
15th Amendments. Approved by the First Congress in 1789 and
ratified by the States in 1791, the first ten <A HREF = 
"amend.htm">amendments</A> to the
Constitution--the Bill of Rights--assure basic individual
liberties essential to a free and democratic society. In the
aftermath of the Civil War, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments
continued the mission of the Bill of Rights by abolishing
slavery, by assuring citizens due process in actions taken under
color of State governments, and by taking the first steps toward
providing suffrage for citizens regardless of race. These
Constitutional guarantees have not only stood as a bulwark
against governmental abuses in this country, but they have also
provided inspiration to people around the world in their quest
for individual freedom and  liberty.

<P>In an effort to make the Constitution both more accessible and
understandable to the public, the House of Representatives has
authorized the publication of this pamphlet edition. The document
includes the text of the Constitution and all 27 amendments,
together with ratification notes and a historical note prepared
by Raymond W. Smock, the Historian of the House of
Representatives. In addition, it provides information on proposed
amendments approved by the Congress but not ratified by the
States, and an analytical index.

<P>The Constitution has served us well for over 200 years, but it
will continue as a strong, vibrant, and vital foundation for
freedom only so long as the American people remain dedicated to
the basic principles on which it rests. Thus, as the United
States sets a course into a third century of constitutional
democracy, let us renew our commitment to, in the words of the
Constitution's Preamble, "form a more perfect Union, establish
Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common
defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of
Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity . . .".

<H3>HISTORICAL NOTE</H3>

<P>The Delegates who convened at the Federal Convention on May 25,
1787, quickly rejected the idea of revising the Articles of Confederation 
and agreed to construct a new framework for 
anational government. Throughout the summer months at theConvention in 
Philadelphia, delegates from 12 States debated theproper form such a 
government should take, but few questioned the need to establish a more 
vigorous government to preside over the
union of States. The 39 delegates who signed the Constitution on
September 17, 1787, expected the new charter to provide a
permanent guarantee of the political liberties achieved in the
Revolution.

<P>Prior to the adoption of the Federal Constitution, an Articles of
Confederation, drafted by the Continental Congress and approved
by 13 States, provided for a union of the former British
colonies. Even before Maryland became the last State to accede to
the Articles in 1781, a number of Americans, particularly those
involved in the prosecution of the Revolutionary War, recognized
the inadequacies of the Articles as a national government. In the
1780s these nationally-minded Americans became increasingly
disturbed by the Articles' failure to provide the central
government with authority to raise revenue, regulate commerce, or
enforce treaties.

<P>Despite repeated proposals that the Continental Congress revise
the Articles, the movement for a new national government began
outside the Congress. Representatives of Maryland and Virginia,
meeting at Mt. Vernon to discuss trade problems between the two
States, agreed to invite delegates from all States to discuss
commercial affairs at a meeting in Annapolis, Maryland, in
September 1786. Although delegates from only five States reached
the Annapolis Convention, that group issued a call for a meeting
of all States to discuss necessary revisions of the Articles of
Confederation. Responding to this call and the endorsement of the
Continental Congress, every State except Rhode Island selected
delegates for the meeting in the State House at Philadelphia.

<P>The document printed here was the product of nearly 4 months of
deliberations in the Federal Convention at Philadelphia. The
challenging task before the delegates was to create a republican
form of government that could encompass the 13 States and
accommodate the anticipated expansion to the West. The
distribution of authority between legislative, executive, and
judicial branches was a boldly original attempt to create an
energetic central government at the same time that the
sovereignty of the people was preserved.

<P>The longest debate of the Convention centered on the proper form
of representation and election for the Congress. The division
between small States that wished to perpetuate the equal
representation of States in the Continental Congress and the
large States that proposed representation proportional to
population threatened to bring the Convention proceedings to a
halt. Over several weeks the delegates developed a complicated
compromise that provided for equal representation of the States
in a Senate elected by State legislature and proportional
representation in a popularly-elected House of Representatives.

<P>The conflict between large and small States disappeared in the
early years of the republic. More lasting was the division
between slave and free States that had been a disturbing
undercurrent in the Convention debates. The Convention's strained
attempt to avoid using the word slavery in the articles granting
recognition and protection to that institution scarcely hid the
regional divisions that would remain unresolved under the terms
of union agreed to in 1787.

<P>The debates in the State ratification conventions of 1787 and
1788 made clear the need to provide amendments to the basic
framework drafted in Philadelphia. Beginning with Massachusetts,
a number of State conventions ratified the Constitution with the
request that a bill of rights be added to protect certain
liberties at the core of English and American political
traditions. The First Congress approved a set of amendments which
became the Bill of Rights when ratified by the States in 1791.
The continuing process of amendment, clearly described in the
notes of the following text, has enabled the Constitution to
accommodate changing conditions in American society at the same
time that the Founders' basic outline of national government
remains intact.
