<h1><a name="abbrev">abbrev</a></h1><pre> /*-breev'/, /*-brev'/ n.  Common abbreviation for
   `abbreviation'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="abend">ABEND</a></h1><pre> /o'bend/, /*-bend'/ n.  [ABnormal END] Abnormal
   termination (of software); <a href="c.htm#crash">crash</a>; <a href="l.htm#lossage">lossage</a>.  Derives from
   an error message on the IBM 360; used jokingly by hackers but
   seriously mainly by <a href="c.htm#code_grinder">code_grinder</a>s.  Usually capitalized, but
   may appear as `abend'.  Hackers will try to persuade you that
   ABEND is called `abend' because it is what system operators do to
   the machine late on Friday when they want to call it a day, and
   hence is from the German `Abend' = `Evening'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="accumulator">accumulator</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Archaic term for a register.  On-line use
   of it as a synonym for `register' is a fairly reliable
   indication that the user has been around for quite a while and/or
   that the architecture under discussion is quite old.  The term in
   full is almost never used of microprocessor registers, for example,
   though symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in `A'
   derive from historical use of the term `accumulator' (and not,
   actually, from `arithmetic').  Confusingly, though, an `A'
   register name prefix may also stand for `address', as for
   example on the Motorola 680x0 family.  2. A register being used for
   arithmetic or logic (as opposed to addressing or a loop index),
   especially one being used to accumulate a sum or count of many
   items.  This use is in context of a particular routine or stretch
   of code.  "The FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an accumulator."
   3. One's in-basket (esp. among old-timers who might use sense 1).
   "You want this reviewed?  Sure, just put it in the accumulator."
   (See <a href="s.htm#stack">stack</a>.)

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ack">ACK</a></h1><pre> /ak/ interj.  1. [from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110]
   Acknowledge.  Used to register one's presence (compare mainstream
   *Yo!*).  An appropriate response to <a href="p.htm#ping">ping</a> or <a href="e.htm#enq">ENQ</a>.
   2. [from the comic strip "Bloom County"] An exclamation of
   surprised disgust, esp. in "Ack pffft!"  Semi-humorous.
   Generally this sense is not spelled in caps (ACK) and is
   distinguished by a following exclamation point.  3. Used to
   politely interrupt someone to tell them you understand their point
   (see <a href="n.htm#nak">NAK</a>).  Thus, for example, you might cut off an overly
   long explanation with "Ack.  Ack.  Ack.  I get it now".

   There is also a usage "ACK?" (from sense 1) meaning "Are you
   there?", often used in email when earlier mail has produced no
   reply, or during a lull in <a href="t.htm#talk_mode">talk_mode</a> to see if the person has
   gone away (the standard humorous response is of course <a href="n.htm#nak">NAK</a>
   (sense 2), i.e., "I'm not here").

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="acme">Acme</a></h1><pre> n.  The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate and
   non-functional gadgetry -- where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson
   shop.  Describing some X as an "Acme X" either means "This is
   <a href="i.htm#insanely_great">insanely_great</a>", or, more likely, "This looks <a href="i.htm#insanely_great">insanely_great</a>
    on paper, but in practice it's really easy to shoot yourself
   in the foot with it."  Compare <a href="p.htm#pistol">pistol</a>.

   This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained
   here for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the
   Warner Brothers' series of "Roadrunner" cartoons.  In these
   cartoons, the famished Wyl E. Coyote was forever attempting to
   catch up with, trap, and eat the Roadrunner.  His attempts usually
   involved one or more high-technology Rube Goldberg devices --
   rocket jetpacks, catapults, magnetic traps, high-powered
   slingshots, etc.  These were usually delivered in large cardboard
   boxes, labeled prominently with the Acme name.  These devices
   invariably malfunctioned in violent and improbable ways.

<h1><a name="acolyte">acolyte</a></h1><pre> n.,obs.  [TMRC] An <a href="o.htm#osu">OSU</a> privileged enough to submit data
and programs to a member of the <a href="p.htm#priesthood">priesthood</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ad-hockery">ad-hockery</a></h1><pre> /ad-hok'*r-ee/ n.  [Purdue] 1. Gratuitous
   assumptions made inside certain programs, esp. expert systems,
   which lead to the appearance of semi-intelligent behavior but are
   in fact entirely arbitrary.  For example, fuzzy-matching against
   input tokens that might be typing errors against a symbol table can
   make it look as though a program knows how to spell.
   2. Special-case code to cope with some awkward input that would
   otherwise cause a program to <a href="c.htm#choke">choke</a>, presuming normal inputs
   are dealt with in some cleaner and more regular way.  Also called
   `ad-hackery', `ad-hocity' (/ad-hos'*-tee/), `ad-crockery'.
   See also <a href="e.htm#eliza_effect">ELIZA_effect</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ada">Ada</a></h1><pre>: n.  A <a href="p.htm#pascal">Pascal</a>-descended language that has been made
   mandatory for Department of Defense software projects by the
   Pentagon.  Hackers are nearly unanimous in observing that,
   technically, it is precisely what one might expect given that kind
   of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee, crockish, difficult
   to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar boondoggle
   (one common description is "The PL/I of the 1980s").  Hackers
   find Ada's exception-handling and inter-process communication
   features particularly hilarious.  Ada Lovelace (the daughter of
   Lord Byron who became the world's first programmer while
   cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his mechanical
   computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly blanch
   at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the kindest
   thing that has been said about it is that there is probably a good
   small language screaming to get out from inside its vast,
   <a href="e.htm#elephantine">elephantine</a> bulk.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="adger">adger</a></h1><pre> /aj'r/ vt.  [UCLA mutant of <a href="n.htm#nadger">nadger</a>] To make a
   bonehead move with consequences that could have been foreseen with
   even slight mental effort.  E.g., "He started removing files and
   promptly adgered the whole project".  Compare <a href="d.htm#dumbass_attack">dumbass_attack</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="admin">admin</a></h1><pre> /ad-min'/ n.  Short for `administrator'; very
   commonly used in speech or on-line to refer to the systems person
   in charge on a computer.  Common constructions on this include
   `sysadmin' and `site admin' (emphasizing the administrator's
   role as a site contact for email and news) or `newsadmin'
   (focusing specifically on news).  Compare <a href="p.htm#postmaster">postmaster</a>,
   <a href="s.htm#sysop">sysop</a>, <a href="s.htm#system_mangler">system_mangler</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="advent">ADVENT</a></h1><pre> /ad'vent/ n.  The prototypical computer adventure
   game, first designed by Will Crowther on the <a href="p.htm#pdp-10">PDP-10</a> in the
   mid-1970s as an attempt at computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and
   expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford in
   1976.  Now better known as Adventure, but the <a href="t.htm#tops-10">TOPS-10</a>
   operating system permitted only six-letter filenames.  See also
   <a href="v.htm#vadding">vadding</a>, <a href="z.htm#zork">Zork</a>, and <a href="i.htm#infocom">Infocom</a>.

   This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in
   text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have
   become fixtures of hacker-speak: "A huge green fierce snake bars
   the way!"  "I see no X here" (for some noun X).  "You are in a
   maze of twisty little passages, all alike."  "You are in a little
   maze of twisty passages, all different."  The `magic words'
   <a href="x.htm#xyzzy">xyzzy</a> and <a href="p.htm#plugh">plugh</a> also derive from this game.

   Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the
   Mammoth & Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a
   `Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that
   also turns up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary
   entrance.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="afaik">AFAIK</a></h1><pre> n.  [Usenet] Abbrev. for "As Far As I Know".

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="afj">AFJ</a></h1><pre> // n.  Written-only abbreviation for "April Fool's
   Joke".  Elaborate April Fool's hoaxes are a long-established
   tradition on Usenet and Internet; see <a href="k.htm#kremvax">kremvax</a> for an example.
   In fact, April Fool's Day is the *only* seasonal holiday
   marked by customary observances on the hacker networks.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ai">AI</a></h1><pre> /A-I/ n.  Abbreviation for `Artificial Intelligence',
   so common that the full form is almost never written or spoken
   among hackers.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ai-complete">AI-complete</a></h1><pre> /A-I k*m-pleet'/ adj.  [MIT, Stanford: by
   analogy with `NP-complete' (see <a href="n.htm#np-">NP-</a>)] Used to describe
   problems or subproblems in AI, to indicate that the solution
   presupposes a solution to the `strong AI problem' (that is, the
   synthesis of a human-level intelligence).  A problem that is
   AI-complete is, in other words, just too hard.

   Examples of AI-complete problems are `The Vision Problem'
   (building a system that can see as well as a human) and `The
   Natural Language Problem' (building a system that can understand
   and speak a natural language as well as a human).  These may appear
   to be modular, but all attempts so far (1993) to solve them have
   foundered on the amount of context information and `intelligence'
   they seem to require. See also <a href="g.htm#gedanken">gedanken</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ai_koans">AI koans</a></h1><pre> /A-I koh'anz/ pl.n.  A series of pastiches of Zen
   teaching riddles created by Danny Hillis at the MIT AI Lab around
   various major figures of the Lab's culture (several are included
   under <a href="a.htm#ai_koans">AI_Koans</a> in Appendix A).  See also <a href="h.htm#ha_ha_only_serious">ha_ha_only_serious</a>

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="aids">AIDS</a></h1><pre> /aydz/ n.  Short for A* Infected Disk Syndrome (`A*'
   is a <a href="g.htm#glob">glob</a> pattern that matches, but is not limited to, Apple),
   this condition is quite often the result of practicing unsafe
   <a href="s.htm#sex">SEX</a>.  See <a href="v.htm#virus">virus</a>, <a href="w.htm#worm">worm</a>, <a href="t.htm#trojan_horse">Trojan_horse</a>,

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="aidx">AIDX</a></h1><pre> n. /aydkz/ n.  Derogatory term for IBM's perverted
   version of UNIX, AIX, especially for the AIX 3.? used in the IBM
   RS/6000 series (some hackers think it is funnier just to pronounce
   "AIX" as "aches").  A victim of the dreaded "hybridism"
   disease, this attempt to combine the two main currents of the UNIX
   stream (<a href="b.htm#bsd">BSD</a> and <a href="u.htm#usg_unix">USG_UNIX</a>) became a <a href="m.htm#monstrosity">monstrosity</a> to
   haunt system administrators' dreams.  For example, if new accounts
   are created while many users are logged on, the load average jumps
   quickly over 20 due to silly implementation of the user databases.
   For a quite similar disease, compare <a href="h.htm#hp-sux">HP-SUX</a>.  Also, compare

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="airplane_rule">airplane rule</a></h1><pre> n.  "Complexity increases the possibility of
   failure; a twin-engine airplane has twice as many engine problems
   as a single-engine airplane."  By analogy, in both software and
   electronics, the rule that simplicity increases robustness.  It is
   correspondingly argued that the right way to build reliable systems
   is to put all your eggs in one basket, after making sure that
   you've built a really *good* basket.  See also <a href="k.htm#kiss_principle">KISS_Principle</a>
   .

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="aliasing_bug">aliasing bug</a></h1><pre> n.  A class of subtle programming errors that
   can arise in code that does dynamic allocation, esp. via
   `malloc(3)' or equivalent.  If several pointers address
   (`aliases for') a given hunk of storage, it may happen that the
   storage is freed or reallocated (and thus moved) through one alias
   and then referenced through another, which may lead to subtle (and
   possibly intermittent) lossage depending on the state and the
   allocation history of the malloc <a href="a.htm#arena">arena</a>.  Avoidable by use of
   allocation strategies that never alias allocated core, or by use of
   higher-level languages, such as <a href="l.htm#lisp">LISP</a>, which employ a garbage
   collector (see <a href="g.htm#gc">GC</a>).  Also called a <a href="s.htm#stale_pointer_bug">stale_pointer_bug</a>.
   See also <a href="p.htm#precedence_lossage">precedence_lossage</a>, <a href="s.htm#smash_the_stack">smash_the_stack</a>,

   Historical note: Though this term is nowadays associated with
   C programming, it was already in use in a very similar sense in the
   Algol-60 and FORTRAN communities in the 1960s.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="all-elbows">all-elbows</a></h1><pre> adj.  [MS-DOS] Of a TSR
   (terminate-and-stay-resident) IBM PC program, such as the N
   pop-up calendar and calculator utilities that circulate on <a href="b.htm#bbs">BBS</a>
   systems: unsociable.  Used to describe a program that rudely steals
   the resources that it needs without considering that other TSRs may
   also be resident.  One particularly common form of rudeness is
   lock-up due to programs fighting over the keyboard interrupt.  See
   <a href="r.htm#rude">rude</a>, also <a href="m.htm#mess-dos">mess-dos</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="alt">alt</a></h1><pre> /awlt/  1. n. The alt shift key on an IBM PC or
   <a href="c.htm#clone">clone</a> keyboard; see <a href="b.htm#bucky_bits">bucky_bits</a>, sense 2 (though typical
   PC usage does not simply set the 0200 bit).  2. n. The `clover'
   or `Command' key on a Macintosh; use of this term usually reveals
   that the speaker hacked PCs before coming to the Mac (see also
   <a href="f.htm#feature_key">feature_key</a>).  Some Mac hackers, confusingly, reserve `alt'
   for the Option key (and it is so labeled on some Mac II keyboards).
   3. n.obs.  [PDP-10; often capitalized to ALT] Alternate name for
   the ASCII ESC character (ASCII 0011011), after the keycap labeling
   on some older terminals; also `altmode' (/awlt'mohd/).  This
   character was almost never pronounced `escape' on an ITS system,
   in <a href="t.htm#teco">TECO</a>, or under TOPS-10 -- always alt, as in "Type alt alt
   to end a TECO command" or "alt-U onto the system" (for "log
   onto the [ITS] system").  This usage probably arose because alt is
   more convenient to say than `escape', especially when followed by
   another alt or a character (or another alt *and* a character,
   for that matter).  3. The alt hierarchy on Usenet, the tree of
   newsgroups created by users without a formal vote and approval
   procedure.  There is a myth, not entirely, implausible, that
   alt is acronymic for "anarchists, lunatics, and terrorists";
   but in fact it is simply short for "alternative".

<h1><a name="aluminum_book">Aluminum Book</a></h1><pre> n.  [MIT] "Common LISP: The Language", by
   Guy L.  Steele Jr. (Digital Press, first edition 1984, second
   edition 1990).  Note that due to a technical screwup some printings
   of the second edition are actually of a color the author describes
   succinctly as "yucky green".  See also <a href="b.htm#book_titles">book_titles</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="angle_brackets">angle brackets</a></h1><pre> n.  Either of the characters `&lt' (ASCII
   0111100) and `&gt' (ASCII 0111110) (ASCII less-than or
   greater-than signs).  Typographers in the <a href="r.htm#real_world">Real_World</a> use angle
   brackets which are either taller and slimmer (the ISO `Bra' and
   `Ket' characters), or significantly smaller (single or double
   guillemets) than the less-than and greater-than signs.
   See <a href="b.htm#broket">broket</a>, <a href="a.htm#ascii">ASCII</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="angry_fruit_salad">angry fruit salad</a></h1><pre> n.  A bad visual-interface design that
   uses too many colors.  (This term derives, of course, from the
   bizarre day-glo colors found in canned fruit salad.)  Too often one
   sees similar effects from interface designers using color window
   systems such as <a href="x.htm#x">X</a>; there is a tendency to create displays that
   are flashy and attention-getting but uncomfortable for long-term
   use.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ansi">ANSI</a></h1><pre> n. /an'see/  1. n. The American National Standards
   Institue. ANSI, along with the International Standards Organization
   (ISO) standardized the C programming language (see <a href="k.htm#k&r">K&R</a>,
   <a href="c.htm#classic_c">Classic_C</a>), and promulgates many other important software
   standards.  2. n. [BBS] The set of screen-painting codes that most
   MS-DOS and Amiga computers accept.  This comes from the ANSI.SYS
   device driver that must be loaded on an MS-DOS computer to view
   such codes.  Unfortunately, neither DOS ANSI nor the BBS ANSIs
   derived from it exactly match the ANSI terminal standard.  For
   example, the ESC-[1m code turns on the bold highlight on large
   machines, but in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it turns on `intense' (bright)
   colors.  Also, in BBS-land, the term `ANSI' is often used to imply
   that a particular computer uses or can emulate the IBM high-half
   character set from MS-DOS.  Particular use depends on
   context. Occasionally, the vanilla ASCII character set is used with
   the color codes, but on BBSs, ANSI and `IBM characters' tend to go
   together.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="aos">AOS</a></h1><pre> 1. /aws/ (East Coast), /ay-os/ (West Coast)
   vt.,obs.  To increase the amount of something.  "AOS the
   campfire."  [based on a PDP-10 increment instruction] Usage:
   considered silly, and now obsolete.  Now largely supplanted by
   <a href="b.htm#bump">bump</a>.  See <a href="s.htm#sos">SOS</a>.  2. n. A <a href="m.htm#multics">Multics</a>-derived OS
   supported at one time by Data General.  This was pronounced
   /A-O-S/ or /A-os/.  A spoof of the standard AOS system
   administrator's manual ("How to Load and Generate your AOS
   System") was created, issued a part number, and circulated as
   photocopy folklore; it was called "How to Goad and Levitate
   your CHAOS System".  3. n. Algebraic Operating System, in reference
   to those calculators which use infix instead of postfix (reverse
   Polish) notation.  4. A <a href="b.htm#bsd">BSD</a>-like operating system for the IBM
   RT.

   Historical note: AOS in sense 1 was the name of a <a href="p.htm#pdp-10">PDP-10</a>
   instruction that took any memory location in the computer and added
   1 to it; AOS meant `Add One and do not Skip'.  Why, you may ask,
   does the `S' stand for `do not Skip' rather than for `Skip'?  Ah,
   here was a beloved piece of PDP-10 folklore.  There were eight such
   instructions: AOSE added 1 and then skipped the next instruction
   if the result was Equal to zero; AOSG added 1 and then skipped if
   the result was Greater than 0; AOSN added 1 and then skipped
   if the result was Not 0; AOSA added 1 and then skipped Always;
   and so on.  Just plain AOS didn't say when to skip, so it never
   skipped.

   For similar reasons, AOJ meant `Add One and do not Jump'.  Even
   more bizarre, SKIP meant `do not SKIP'!  If you wanted to skip the
   next instruction, you had to say `SKIPA'.  Likewise, JUMP meant
   `do not JUMP'; the unconditional form was JUMPA.  However, hackers
   never did this.  By some quirk of the 10's design, the <a href="j.htm#jrst">JRST</a>
   (Jump and ReSTore flag with no flag specified) was actually faster
   and so was invariably used.  Such were the perverse mysteries of
   assembler programming.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="app">app</a></h1><pre> /ap/ n.  Short for `application program', as opposed
   to a systems program.  Apps are what systems vendors are forever
   chasing developers to create for their environments so they can
   sell more boxes.  Hackers tend not to think of the things they
   themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker parlance the term excludes
   compilers, program editors, games, and messaging systems, though a
   user would consider all those to be apps.  (Broadly, an app is
   often a self-contained environment for performing some well-defined
   task such as `word processing'; hackers tend to prefer more
   general-purpose tools.) Oppose <a href="t.htm#tool">tool</a>, <a href="o.htm#operating_system">operating_system</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="arena">arena</a></h1><pre> [UNIX] n.  The area of memory attached to a process by
   `brk(2)' and `sbrk(2)' and used by `malloc(3)' as

<h1><a name="armm">ARMM</a></h1><pre> n.  [acronym, `Automated Retroactive Minimal
   Moderation'] A Usenet robot created by Dick Depew of Munroe Falls,
   Ohio.  ARMM was intended to automatically cancel posts from
   anonymous-posting sites.  Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for
   anonymous postings triggered on its own automatically-generated
   control messages!  Transformed by this stroke of programming
   ineptitude into a monster of Frankensteinian proportions, it broke
   loose on the night of March 31, 1993 and proceeded to <a href="s.htm#spam">spam</a>
   news.admin.policy with a recursive explosion of over 200
   messages.

   ARMM's bug produced a recursive <a href="c.htm#cascade">cascade</a> of messages each of which
   mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and some other
   headers of its parent.  This produced a flood of messages in which
   each header took up several screens and each message ID and subject
   line got longer and longer and longer.

   Reactions varied from amusement to outrage.  The pathological
   messages crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying
   line charges for their Usenet feeds.  One poster described the ARMM
   debacle as "instant Usenet history" (also establishing the term
   <a href="d.htm#despew">despew</a>), and it has since been widely cited as a cautionary
   example of the havoc the combination of good intentions and
   incompetence can wreak on a network.  Compare <a href="g.htm#great_worm,_the">Great_Worm,_the</a>;

<h1><a name="ascii">ASCII</a></h1><pre>: /as'kee/ n.  [acronym: American Standard Code for
   Information Interchange] The predominant character set encoding of
   present-day computers.  The modern version uses 7 bits for each
   character, whereas most earlier codes (including an early version
   of ASCII) used fewer.  This change allowed the inclusion of
   lowercase letters -- a major <a href="w.htm#win">win</a> -- but it did not provide
   for accented letters or any other letterforms not used in English
   (such as the German sharp-S
   or the ae-ligature
   which is a letter in, for example, Norwegian).  It could be worse,
   though.  It could be much worse.  See <a href="e.htm#ebcdic">EBCDIC</a> to understand how.
   
   Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than
   humans; thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about
   characters, and have developed a considerable amount of verbal
   shorthand for them.  Every character has one or more names -- some
   formal, some concise, some silly.  Common jargon names for ASCII
   characters are collected here.  See also individual entries for
   <a href="b.htm#bang">bang</a>, <a href="e.htm#excl">excl</a>, <a href="o.htm#open">open</a>, <a href="q.htm#ques">ques</a>, <a href="s.htm#semi">semi</a>, <a href="s.htm#shriek">shriek</a>,

   pronunciation guide.  Single characters are listed in ASCII order;
   character pairs are sorted in by first member.  For each character,
   common names are given in rough order of popularity, followed by
   names that are reported but rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names
   are surrounded by brokets: &lt&gt.  Square brackets mark the
   particularly silly names introduced by <a href="i.htm#intercal">INTERCAL</a>.  The
   abbreviations "l/r" and "o/c" stand for left/right and
   "open/close" respectively.  Ordinary parentheticals provide some
   usage information.

   The pronunciation of `#' as `pound' is common in the U.S.
   but a bad idea; <a href="c.htm#commonwealth_hackish">Commonwealth_Hackish</a> has its own, rather more
   apposite use of `pound sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards
   the pound graphic
   happens to replace `#'; thus Britishers sometimes
   call `#' on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard `pound', compounding the
   American error).  The U.S. usage derives from an old-fashioned
   commercial practice of using a `#' suffix to tag pound weights
   on bills of lading.  The character is usually pronounced `hash'
   outside the U.S.

   The `uparrow' name for circumflex and `leftarrow' name for
   underline are historical relics from archaic ASCII (the 1963
   version), which had these graphics in those character positions
   rather than the modern punctuation characters.

   The `swung dash' or `approximation' sign is not quite the same
   as tilde in typeset material
   but the ASCII tilde serves for both (compare <a href="a.htm#angle_brackets">angle_brackets</a>
   ).

   Some other common usages cause odd overlaps.  The `#',
   `$', `&gt', and `&' characters, for example, are all
   pronounced "hex" in different communities because various
   assemblers use them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in
   particular, `#' in many assembler-programming cultures,
   `$' in the 6502 world, `&gt' at Texas Instruments, and
   `&' on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80 machines).  See
   also <a href="s.htm#splat">splat</a>.

   The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the
   world's other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits
   look more and more like a serious <a href="m.htm#misfeature">misfeature</a> as the use of
   international networks continues to increase (see <a href="s.htm#software_rot">software_rot</a>
   ).  Hardware and software from the U.S. still tends to embody
   the assumption that ASCII is the universal character set and that
   characters have 7 bits; this is a a major irritant to people who
   want to use a character set suited to their own languages.
   Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem by proliferating
   `national' character sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use
   a *smaller* subset common to all those in use.

<h1><a name="asciibetical_order">ASCIIbetical order</a></h1><pre> /as'kee-be'-t*-kl or'dr/ adj.,n.  Used
   to indicate that data is sorted in ASCII collated order rather than

<h1><a name="atomic">atomic</a></h1><pre> adj.  [from Gk. `atomos', indivisible]
   1. Indivisible; cannot be split up.  For example, an instruction
   may be said to do several things `atomically', i.e., all the
   things are done immediately, and there is no chance of the
   instruction being half-completed or of another being interspersed.
   Used esp. to convey that an operation cannot be screwed up by
   interrupts.  "This routine locks the file and increments the
   file's semaphore atomically."  2. [primarily techspeak] Guaranteed
   to complete successfully or not at all, usu. refers to database
   transactions.  If an error prevents a partially-performed
   transaction from proceeding to completion, it must be "backed out,"
   as the database must not be left in an inconsistent state.

   Computer usage, in either of the above senses, has none of the
   connotations that `atomic' has in mainstream English (i.e.  of
   particles of matter, nuclear explosions etc.).

<h1><a name="attoparsec">attoparsec</a></h1><pre> n.  About an inch.  `atto-' is the standard SI
   prefix for multiplication by 10^(-18).  A parsec
   (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years; an attoparsec is thus
   3.26 * 10^(-18) light years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1
   attoparsec/<a href="m.htm#microfortnight">microfortnight</a> equals about 1 inch/sec).  This unit
   is reported to be in use (though probably not very seriously) among

   characterized by C-like syntax, a declaration-free approach to
   variable typing and declarations, associative arrays, and
   field-oriented text processing.  See also <a href="p.htm#perl">Perl</a>.  2. n.
   Editing term for an expression awkward to manipulate through normal
