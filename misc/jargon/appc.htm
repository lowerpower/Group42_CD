**************

Here are some other books you can read to help you understand the
hacker mindset.


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="g"odel,_escher,_bach">G"odel, Escher, Bach</a></h1><pre> An Eternal Golden Braid:
Douglas Hofstadter
Basic Books, 1979
ISBN 0-394-74502-7

This book reads like an intellectual Grand Tour of hacker
preoccupations.  Music, mathematical logic, programming, speculations
on the nature of intelligence, biology, and Zen are woven into a
brilliant tapestry themed on the concept of encoded self-reference.
The perfect left-brain companion to "Illuminatus".


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="illuminatus!">Illuminatus!</a></h1><pre>
    I.   "The Eye in the Pyramid"
    II.  "The Golden Apple"
    III. "Leviathan".
Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson
Dell, 1988
ISBN 0-440-53981-1

This work of alleged fiction is an incredible berserko-surrealist
rollercoaster of world-girdling conspiracies, intelligent dolphins,
the fall of Atlantis, who really killed JFK, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll,
and the Cosmic Giggle Factor.  First published in three volumes, but
there is now a one-volume trade paperback, carried by most chain
bookstores under SF.  The perfect right-brain companion to
Hofstadter's "G"odel, Escher, Bach".  See <a href="e.htm#eris">Eris</a>, <a href="d.htm#discordianism">Discordianism</a>,

<h1><a name="the_hitchhiker's_guide_to_the_galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></h1><pre>
Douglas Adams
Pocket Books, 1981
ISBN 0-671-46149-4

This `Monty Python in Space' spoof of SF genre traditions has been
popular among hackers ever since the original British radio show.
Read it if only to learn about Vogons (see <a href="b.htm#bogon">bogon</a>) and the
significance of the number 42 (see <a href="r.htm#random_numbers">random_numbers</a>) -- and why the
winningest chess program of 1990 was called `Deep Thought'.


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="the_tao_of_programming">The Tao of Programming</a></h1><pre>
James Geoffrey
Infobooks, 1987
ISBN 0-931137-07-1

This gentle, funny spoof of the "Tao Te Ching" contains much that is
illuminating about the hacker way of thought.  "When you have learned
to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be time for you
to leave."


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="hackers">Hackers</a></h1><pre>
Steven Levy
Anchor/Doubleday 1984
ISBN 0-385-19195-2

Levy's book is at its best in describing the early MIT hackers at the
Model Railroad Club and the early days of the microcomputer
revolution.  He never understood UNIX or the networks, though, and his
enshrinement of Richard Stallman as "the last true hacker" turns out
(thankfully) to have been quite misleading.  Numerous minor factual
errors also mar the text; for example, Levy's claim that the original
Jargon File derived from the TMRC Dictionary (the File originated at
Stanford and was brought to MIT in 1976; the co-authors of the first
edition had never seen the dictionary in question).  There are also
numerous misspellings in the book that inflame the passions of
old-timers; as Dan Murphy, the author of TECO, once said: "You would
have thought he'd take the trouble to spell the name of a winning
editor right."  Nevertheless, this remains a useful and stimulating
book that captures the feel of several important hackish subcultures.

<h1><a name="the_devil's_dp_dictionary">The Devil's DP Dictionary</a></h1><pre>
Stan Kelly-Bootle
McGraw-Hill, 1981
ISBN 0-07-034022-6

This pastiche of Ambrose Bierce's famous work is similar in format to
the Jargon File (and quotes several entries from jargon-1) but
somewhat different in tone and intent.  It is more satirical and less
anthropological, and is largely a product of the author's literate and
quirky imagination.  For example, it defines `computer science' as "a
study akin to numerology and astrology, but lacking the precision of
the former and the success of the latter" and "the boring art of
coping with a large number of trivialities."

<h1><a name="the_devouring_fungus">The Devouring Fungus</a></h1><pre> Tales from the Computer Age:
Karla Jennings
Norton, 1990
ISBN 0-393-30732-8

The author of this pioneering compendium knits together a great deal
of computer- and hacker-related folklore with good writing and a few
well-chosen cartoons.  She has a keen eye for the human aspects of the
lore and is very good at illuminating the psychology and evolution of
hackerdom.  Unfortunately, a number of small errors and awkwardnesses
suggest that she didn't have the final manuscript checked over by a
native speaker; the glossary in the back is particularly embarrassing,
and at least one classic tale (the Magic Switch story, retold here
under <a href="appa.htm#a_story_about_`magic'">A_Story_About_`Magic'</a> in Appendix A is given in incomplete and
badly mangled form.  Nevertheless, this book is a win overall and can
be enjoyed by hacker and non-hacker alike.

<h1><a name="the_soul_of_a_new_machine">The Soul of a New Machine</a></h1><pre>
Tracy Kidder
Little, Brown, 1981
(paperback: Avon, 1982
ISBN 0-380-59931-7)

This book (a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winner) documents the adventure of
the design of a new Data General computer, the MV-8000 Eagle.  It is
an amazingly well-done portrait of the hacker mindset -- although
largely the hardware hacker -- done by a complete outsider.  It is a
bit thin in spots, but with enough technical information to be
entertaining to the serious hacker while providing non-technical
people a view of what day-to-day life can be like -- the fun, the
excitement, the disasters.  During one period, when the microcode and
logic were glitching at the nanosecond level, one of the overworked
engineers departed the company, leaving behind a note on his terminal
as his letter of resignation: "I am going to a commune in Vermont and
will deal with no unit of time shorter than a season."

<h1><a name="life_with_unix">Life with UNIX</a></h1><pre> a Guide for Everyone:
Don Libes and Sandy Ressler
Prentice-Hall, 1989
ISBN 0-13-536657-7

The authors of this book set out to tell you all the things about UNIX
that tutorials and technical books won't.  The result is gossipy,
funny, opinionated, downright weird in spots, and invaluable.  Along
the way they expose you to enough of UNIX's history, folklore and
humor to qualify as a first-class source for these things.  Because so
much of today's hackerdom is involved with UNIX, this in turn
illuminates many of its in-jokes and preoccupations.


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="true_names_..._and_other_dangers">True Names ... and Other Dangers</a></h1><pre>
Vernor Vinge
Baen Books, 1987
ISBN 0-671-65363-6

Hacker demigod Richard Stallman used to say that the title story of
this book "expresses the spirit of hacking best".  Until the subject
of the next entry came out, it was hard to even nominate another
contender.  The other stories in this collection are also fine work by
an author who has since won multiple Hugos and is one of today's very
best practitioners of hard SF.


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="snow_crash">Snow Crash</a></h1><pre>
Neal Stephenson
Stephenson's epic, comic cyberpunk novel is deeply knowing about the
hacker psychology and its foibles in a way no other author of fiction
has ever even approached.  His imagination, his grasp of the relevant
technical details, and his ability to communicate the excitement of
hacking and its results are astonishing, delightful, and unsurpassed.


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</a></h1><pre> Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier:
Katie Hafner & John Markoff
Simon & Schuster 1991
ISBN 0-671-68322-5

This book gathers narratives about the careers of three notorious
crackers into a clear-eyed but sympathetic portrait of hackerdom's
dark side.  The principals are Kevin Mitnick, "Pengo" and "Hagbard" of
the Chaos Computer Club, and Robert T. Morris (see <a href="r.htm#rtm">RTM</a>, sense 2) .
Markoff and Hafner focus as much on their psychologies and motivations
as on the details of their exploits, but don't slight the latter.  The
result is a balanced and fascinating account, particularly useful when
read immediately before or after Cliff Stoll's <a href="appc.htm#the_cuckoo's_egg">The_Cuckoo's_Egg</a>.  It
is especially instructive to compare RTM, a true hacker who blundered,
with the sociopathic phone-freak Mitnick and the alienated,
drug-addled crackers who made the Chaos Club notorious.  The gulf
between <a href="w.htm#wizard">wizard</a> and <a href="w.htm#wannabee">wannabee</a> has seldom been made more obvious.


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="technobabble">Technobabble</a></h1><pre>
John Barry
MIT Press 1991
ISBN 0-262-02333-4

Barry's book takes a critical and humorous look at the `technobabble'
of acronyms, neologisms, hyperbole, and metaphor spawned by the
computer industry.  Though he discusses some of the same mechanisms of
jargon formation that occur in hackish, most of what he chronicles is
actually suit-speak -- the obfuscatory language of press releases,
marketroids, and Silicon Valley CEOs rather than the playful jargon of
hackers (most of whom wouldn't be caught dead uttering the kind of
pompous, passive-voiced word salad he deplores).


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="the_cuckoo's_egg">The Cuckoo's Egg</a></h1><pre>
Clifford Stoll
Doubleday 1989
ISBN 0-385-24946-2

Clifford Stoll's absorbing tale of how he tracked Markus Hess and the
Chaos Club cracking ring nicely illustrates the difference between
`hacker' and `cracker'.  Stoll's portrait of himself, his lady Martha,
and his friends at Berkeley and on the Internet paints a marvelously
vivid picture of how hackers and the people around them like to live
and how they think.
