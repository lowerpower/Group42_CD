<h1><a name="c">C</a></h1><pre> n.  1. The third letter of the English alphabet.  2. ASCII
   1000011.  3. The name of a programming language designed by Dennis
   Ritchie during the early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement
   <a href="u.htm#unix">UNIX</a>; so called because many features derived from an earlier
   compiler named `B' in commemoration of *its* parent, BCPL.
   (BCPL was in turn descended from an earlier Algol-derived language,
   CPL.)  Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled the question by designing
   C++, there was a humorous debate over whether C's successor should
   be named `D' or `P'.  C became immensely popular outside Bell Labs
   after about 1980 and is now the dominant language in systems and
   microcomputer applications programming.  See also <a href="l.htm#languages_of_choice">languages_of_choice</a>
   , <a href="i.htm#indent_style">indent_style</a>.

   C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain
   varying according to the speaker, as "a language that combines
   all the elegance and power of assembly language with all the
   readability and maintainability of assembly language".

<h1><a name="c_programmer's_disease">C Programmer's Disease</a></h1><pre> n.  The tendency of the undisciplined
   C programmer to set arbitrary but supposedly generous static limits
   on table sizes (defined, if you're lucky, by constants in header
   files) rather than taking the trouble to do proper dynamic storage
   allocation.  If an application user later needs to put 68 elements
   into a table of size 50, the afflicted programmer reasons that he
   or she can easily reset the table size to 68 (or even as much as
   70, to allow for future expansion) and recompile.  This gives the
   programmer the comfortable feeling of having made the effort to
   satisfy the user's (unreasonable) demands, and often affords the
   user multiple opportunities to explore the marvelous consequences
   of <a href="f.htm#fandango_on_core">fandango_on_core</a>.  In severe cases of the disease, the
   programmer cannot comprehend why each fix of this kind seems only
   to further disgruntle the user.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="calculator">calculator</a></h1><pre> [Cambridge] n.  Syn. for <a href="b.htm#bitty_box">bitty_box</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="can">can</a></h1><pre> vt.  To abort a job on a time-sharing system.  Used
   esp. when the person doing the deed is an operator, as in
   "canned from the <a href="c.htm#console">console</a>".  Frequently used in an imperative
   sense, as in "Can that print job, the LPT just popped a
   sprocket!"  Synonymous with <a href="g.htm#gun">gun</a>.  It is said that the ASCII
   character with mnemonic CAN (0011000) was used as a kill-job
   character on some early OSes.  Alternatively, this term may derive
   from mainstream slang `canned' for being laid off or fired.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="can't_happen">can't happen</a></h1><pre>  The traditional program comment for code
   executed under a condition that should never be true, for example a
   file size computed as negative.  Often, such a condition being true
   indicates data corruption or a faulty algorithm; it is almost
   always handled by emitting a fatal error message and terminating or
   crashing, since there is little else that can be done.  Some case
   variant of "can't happen" is also often the text emitted if the
   `impossible' error actually happens!  Although "can't happen"
   events are genuinely infrequent in production code, programmers
   wise enough to check for them habitually are often surprised at how
   frequently they are triggered during development and how many
   headaches checking for them turns out to head off. See also
   <a href="f.htm#firewall_code">firewall_code</a> (sense 2).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="candygrammar">candygrammar</a></h1><pre> n.  A programming-language grammar that is
   mostly <a href="s.htm#syntactic_sugar">syntactic_sugar</a>; the term is also a play on
   `candygram'.  <a href="c.htm#cobol">COBOL</a>, Apple's Hypertalk language, and a lot
   of the so-called `4GL' database languages share this property.
   The usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as
   possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled
   people to program.  This intention comes to grief on the reality
   that syntax isn't what makes programming hard; it's the mental
   effort and organization required to specify an algorithm precisely
   that costs.  Thus the invariable result is that `candygrammar'
   languages are just as difficult to program in as terser ones, and
   far more painful for the experienced hacker.

   [The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live
   should not be overlooked.  This was a "Jaws" parody.
   Someone lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus
   ways to get the occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in
   the background.  The last attempt is a half-hearted "Candygram!"
   When the door is opened, a shark bursts in and chomps the poor
   occupant.  There is a moral here for those attracted to
   candygrammars.  Note that, in many circles, pretty much the same
   ones who remember Monty Python sketches, all it takes is the word
   "Candygram!", suitably timed, to get people rolling on the
   floor. -- GLS]

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="canonical">canonical</a></h1><pre> adj.  [historically, `according to religious law']
   The usual or standard state or manner of something.  This word has
   a somewhat more technical meaning in mathematics.  Two formulas
   such as 9 + x and x + 9 are said to be equivalent
   because they mean the same thing, but the second one is in
   `canonical form' because it is written in the usual way, with the
   highest power of x first.  Usually there are fixed rules you
   can use to decide whether something is in canonical form.  The
   jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning, acquired its
   present loading in computer-science culture largely through its
   prominence in Alonzo Church's work in computation theory and
   mathematical logic (see <a href="k.htm#knights_of_the_lambda_calculus">Knights_of_the_Lambda_Calculus</a>).
   Compare <a href="v.htm#vanilla">vanilla</a>.

   This word has an interesting history.  Non-technical academics do
   not use the adjective `canonical' in any of the senses defined
   above with any regularity; they do however use the nouns `canon'
   and `canonicity' (not **canonicalness or **canonicality). The
   `canon' of a given author is the complete body of authentic works
   by that author (this usage is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as
   well as to literary scholars).  `*The* canon' is the body of
   works in a given field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of
   music) deemed worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to
   investigate.

   The word `canon' derives ultimately from the Greek
   `kanon'
   (akin to the English `cane') referring to a reed.  Reeds were used
   for measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word `canon'
   meant a rule or a standard.  The establishment of a canon of
   scriptures within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a
   rule for the religion.  The above non-techspeak academic usages
   stem from this instance of a defined and accepted body of work.
   Alongside this usage was the promulgation of `canons' (`rules')
   for the government of the Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages
   ("according to religious law") derive from this use of the Latin
   `canon'.

   Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
   contrast with its historical meaning.  A true story: One Bob
   Sjoberg, new at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the
   incessant use of jargon.  Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS
   made a point of using as much of it as possible in his presence,
   and eventually it began to sink in.  Finally, in one conversation,
   he used the word `canonical' in jargon-like fashion without
   thinking.  Steele: "Aha!  We've finally got you talking jargon
   too!"  Stallman: "What did he say?"  Steele: "Bob just used
   `canonical' in the canonical way."

   Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly
   defined as the way *hackers* normally expect things to be.
   Thus, a hacker may claim with a straight face that `according to
   religious law' is *not* the canonical meaning of
   `canonical'.

<h1><a name="card_walloper">card walloper</a></h1><pre> n.  An EDP programmer who grinds out batch
   programs that do stupid things like print people's paychecks.
   Compare <a href="c.htm#code_grinder">code_grinder</a>.  See also <a href="p.htm#punched_card">punched_card</a>,
   <a href="e.htm#eighty-column_mind">eighty-column_mind</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="careware">careware</a></h1><pre> /keir'weir/ n.  A variety of <a href="s.htm#shareware">shareware</a> for
   which either the author suggests that some payment be made to a
   nominated charity or a levy directed to charity is included on top
   of the distribution charge.  Syn. <a href="c.htm#charityware">charityware</a>; compare
   <a href="c.htm#crippleware">crippleware</a>, sense 2.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cargo_cult_programming">cargo cult programming</a></h1><pre> n.  A style of (incompetent)
   programming dominated by ritual inclusion of code or program
   structures that serve no real purpose.  A cargo cult programmer
   will usually explain the extra code as a way of working around some
   bug encountered in the past, but usually neither the bug nor the
   reason the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully
   understood (compare <a href="s.htm#shotgun_debugging">shotgun_debugging</a>, <a href="v.htm#voodoo_programming">voodoo_programming</a>
   ).

   The term `cargo cult' is a reference to aboriginal religions that
   grew up in the South Pacific after World War II.  The practices of
   these cults center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes and
   military style landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of
   the god-like airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the
   war.  Hackish usage probably derives from Richard Feynman's
   characterization of certain practices as "cargo cult science" in
   his book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" (W. W. Norton
   & Co, New York 1985, ISBN 0-393-01921-7).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cascade">cascade</a></h1><pre> n.  1. A huge volume of spurious error-message
   output produced by a compiler with poor error recovery.  Too
   frequently, one trivial syntax error (such as a missing `)' or
   `}') throws the parser out of synch so that much of the remaining
   program text is interpreted as garbaged or ill-formed.  2. A chain
   of Usenet followups, each adding some trivial variation or riposte
   to the text of the previous one, all of which is reproduced in the
   new message; an <a href="i.htm#include_war">include_war</a> in which the object is to create a
   sort of communal graffito.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="case_and_paste">case and paste</a></h1><pre> n.  [from `cut and paste'] 1. The addition of a new
   <a href="f.htm#feature">feature</a> to an existing system by selecting the code from an
   existing feature and pasting it in with minor changes.  Common in
   telephony circles because most operations in a telephone switch are
   selected using `case' statements.  Leads to <a href="s.htm#software_bloat">software_bloat</a>.

   In some circles of EMACS users this is called `programming by
   Meta-W', because Meta-W is the EMACS command for copying a block of
   text to a kill buffer in preparation to pasting it in elsewhere.
   The term is condescending, implying that the programmer is acting
   mindlessly rather than thinking carefully about what is required to
   integrate the code for two similar cases.

   At DEC, this is sometimes called `clone-and-hack' coding.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="casters-up_mode">casters-up mode</a></h1><pre> n.  [IBM, prob. fr. slang belly up] Yet
   another synonym for `broken' or `down'.  Usually connotes a
   major failure.  A system (hardware or software) which is `down'
   may be already being restarted before the failure is noticed,
   whereas one which is `casters up' is usually a good excuse to
   take the rest of the day off (as long as you're not responsible for
   fixing it).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="casting_the_runes">casting the runes</a></h1><pre> n.  What a <a href="g.htm#guru">guru</a> does when you ask him
   or her to run a particular program and type at it because it never
   works for anyone else; esp. used when nobody can ever see what
   the guru is doing different from what J. Random Luser does.
   Compare <a href="i.htm#incantation">incantation</a>, <a href="r.htm#runes">runes</a>, <a href="e.htm#examining_the_entrails">examining_the_entrails</a>;
   also see the AI koan about Tom Knight in "<a href="a.htm#ai_koans">AI_Koans</a>"
   (Appendix A).

   A correspondent from England tells us that one of ICL's most
   talented systems designers used to be called out occasionally to
   service machines which the <a href="f.htm#field_circus">field_circus</a> had given up on.  Since
he
   knew the design inside out, he could often find faults simply by
   listening to a quick outline of the symptoms.  He used to play on
   this by going to some site where the field circus had just spent
   the last two weeks solid trying to find a fault, and spreading a
   diagram of the system out on a table top.  He'd then shake some
   chicken bones and cast them over the diagram, peer at the bones
   intently for a minute, and then tell them that a certain module
   needed replacing.  The system would start working again
   immediately.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cat">cat</a></h1><pre> [from `catenate' via <a href="u.htm#unix">UNIX</a> `cat(1)'] vt. 
   1. [techspeak] To spew an entire file to the screen or some other
   output sink without pause.  2. By extension, to dump large amounts
   of data at an unprepared target or with no intention of browsing it
   carefully.  Usage: considered silly.  Rare outside UNIX sites.  See
   also <a href="d.htm#dd">dd</a>, <a href="b.htm#blt">BLT</a>.

   Among UNIX fans, `cat(1)' is considered an excellent example
   of user-interface design, because it delivers the file contents
   without such verbosity as spacing or headers between the files, and
   because it does not require the files to consist of lines of text,
   but works with any sort of data.

   Among UNIX haters, `cat(1)' is considered the <a href="c.htm#canonical">canonical</a>
   example of *bad* user-interface design, because of its
   woefully unobvious name.  It is far more often used to <a href="b.htm#blast">blast</a> a
   file to standard output than to concatenate two files.  The name
   `cat' for the former operation is just as unintuitive as, say,
   LISP's <a href="c.htm#cdr">cdr</a>.

   Of such oppositions are <a href="h.htm#holy_wars">holy_wars</a> made....

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="catatonic">catatonic</a></h1><pre> adj.  Describes a condition of suspended animation
   in which something is so <a href="w.htm#wedged">wedged</a> or <a href="h.htm#hung">hung</a> that it makes no
   response.  If you are typing on a terminal and suddenly the
   computer doesn't even echo the letters back to the screen as you
   type, let alone do what you're asking it to do, then the computer
   is suffering from catatonia (possibly because it has crashed).
   "There I was in the middle of a winning game of <a href="n.htm#nethack">nethack</a> and
   it went catatonic on me!  Aaargh!" Compare <a href="b.htm#buzz">buzz</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cd_tilde">cd tilde</a></h1><pre> /C-D til-d*/ vi.  To go home.  From the UNIX
   C-shell and Korn-shell command `cd ~', which takes one to
   one's `$HOME' (`cd' with no arguments happens to do the
   same thing).  By extension, may be used with other arguments; thus,
   over an electronic chat link, `cd ~coffee' would mean "I'm
   going to the coffee machine."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cdr">cdr</a></h1><pre> /ku'dr/ or /kuh'dr/ vt.  [from LISP] To skip past
   the first item from a list of things (generalized from the LISP
   operation on binary tree structures, which returns a list
   consisting of all but the first element of its argument).  In the
   form `cdr down', to trace down a list of elements: "Shall we cdr
   down the agenda?"  Usage: silly.  See also <a href="l.htm#loop_through">loop_through</a>.

   Historical note: The instruction format of the IBM 7090 that hosted
   the original LISP implementation featured two 15-bit fields called
   the `address' and `decrement' parts.  The term `cdr' was originally
   `Contents of Decrement part of Register'.  Similarly, `car' stood
   for `Contents of Address part of Register'.

   The cdr and car operations have since become bases for
   formation of compound metaphors in non-LISP contexts.  GLS recalls,
   for example, a programming project in which strings were
   represented as linked lists; the get-character and skip-character
   operations were of course called CHAR and CHDR.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="chad">chad</a></h1><pre> /chad/ n.  1. The perforated edge strips on printer
   paper, after they have been separated from the printed portion.
   Also called <a href="s.htm#selvage">selvage</a> and <a href="p.htm#perf">perf</a>.  2. obs. The confetti-like
   paper bits punched out of cards or paper tape; this has also been
   called `chaff', `computer confetti', and `keypunch
   droppings'.  This use may now be mainstream; it has been reported
   seen (1993) in directions for a card-based voting machine in
   California.

   Historical note: One correspondent believes `chad' (sense 2)
   derives from the Chadless keypunch (named for its inventor), which
   cut little u-shaped tabs in the card to make a hole when the tab
   folded back, rather than punching out a circle/rectangle; it was
   clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make them, then the
   stuff that other keypunches made had to be `chad'.  There is an
   legend that the word was originally acronymic, standing for
   "Card Hole Aggregate Debris", but this has all the earmarks of
   a bogus folk etymology.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="chad_box">chad box</a></h1><pre> n.  A metal box about the size of a lunchbox (or in
   some models a large wastebasket), for collecting the <a href="c.htm#chad">chad</a>
   (sense 2) that accumulated in <a href="i.htm#iron_age">Iron_Age</a> card punches.  You had
   to open the covers of the card punch periodically and empty the
   chad box.  The <a href="b.htm#bit_bucket">bit_bucket</a> was notionally the equivalent device
   in the CPU enclosure, which was typically across the room in
   another great gray-and-blue box.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="chain">chain</a></h1><pre>  1. vi. [orig. from BASIC's `CHAIN' statement]
   To hand off execution to a child or successor without going
   through the <a href="o.htm#os">OS</a> command interpreter that invoked it.  The state
   of the parent program is lost and there is no returning to it.
   Though this facility used to be common on memory-limited micros and
   is still widely supported for backward compatibility, the jargon
   usage is semi-obsolescent; in particular, most UNIX programmers
   will think of this as an <a href="e.htm#exec">exec</a>.  Oppose the more modern
   `subshell'.  2. n. A series of linked data areas within an
   operating system or application.  `Chain rattling' is the process
   of repeatedly running through the linked data areas searching for
   one which is of interest to the executing program.  The implication
   is that there is a very large number of links on the chain.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="channel">channel</a></h1><pre> n.  [IRC] The basic unit of discussion on <a href="i.htm#irc">IRC</a>.
   Once one joins a channel, everything one types is read by others on
   that channel.  Channels can either be named with numbers or with
   strings that begin with a `#' sign and can have topic descriptions
   (which are generally irrelevant to the actual subject of
   discussion).  Some notable channels are `#initgame',
   `#hottub', and `#report'.  At times of international
   crisis, `#report' has hundreds of members, some of whom take
   turns listening to various news services and typing in summaries of
   the news, or in some cases, giving first-hand accounts of the
   action (e.g., Scud missile attacks in Tel Aviv during the Gulf War
   in 1991).
   
</pre><p>
<h1><a name="channel_hopping">channel hopping</a></h1><pre> n.  [IRC, GEnie] To rapidly switch channels
   on <a href="i.htm#irc">IRC</a>, or a GEnie chat board, just as a social butterfly
   might hop from one group to another at a party.  This term may
   derive from the TV watcher's idiom, `channel surfing'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="channel_op">channel op</a></h1><pre> /chan'l op/ n.  [IRC] Someone who is endowed
   with privileges on a particular <a href="i.htm#irc">IRC</a> channel; commonly
   abbreviated `chanop' or `CHOP'.  These privileges include the
   right to <a href="k.htm#kick">kick</a> users, to change various status bits, and to
   make others into CHOPs.
   
</pre><p>
<h1><a name="chanop">chanop</a></h1><pre> /chan'-op/ n.  [IRC] See <a href="c.htm#channel_op">channel_op</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="char">char</a></h1><pre> /keir/ or /char/; rarely, /kar/ n.  Shorthand for
   `character'.  Esp. used by C programmers, as `char' is C's
   typename for character data.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="charityware">charityware</a></h1><pre> /cha'rit-ee-weir`/ n.  Syn. <a href="c.htm#careware">careware</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="chase_pointers">chase pointers</a></h1><pre>  1. vi. To go through multiple levels of
   indirection, as in traversing a linked list or graph structure.
   Used esp. by programmers in C, where explicit pointers are a very
   common data type.  This is techspeak, but it remains jargon when
   used of human networks.  "I'm chasing pointers.  Bob said you
   could tell me who to talk to about...." See <a href="d.htm#dangling_pointer">dangling_pointer</a>
    and <a href="s.htm#snap">snap</a>.  2. [Cambridge] `pointer chase' or
   `pointer hunt': The process of going through a <a href="c.htm#core_dump">core_dump</a>
   (sense 1), interactively or on a large piece of paper printed with
   hex <a href="r.htm#runes">runes</a>, following dynamic data-structures.  Used only in a
   debugging context.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="chawmp">chawmp</a></h1><pre> n.  [University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a
   machine word).  This term was used by FORTH hackers during the late
   1970s/early 1980s; it is said to have been archaic then, and may
   now be obsolete.  It was coined in revolt against the promiscuous
   use of `word' for anything between 16 and 32 bits; `word' has
   an additional special meaning for FORTH hacks that made the
   overloading intolerable.  For similar reasons, /gaw'bl/ (spelled
   `gawble' or possibly `gawbul') was in use as a term for 32 or
   48 bits (presumably a full machine word, but our sources are
   unclear on this).  These terms are more easily understood if one
   thinks of them as `chomp' and `gobble' pronounced in a Florida or
   other Southern U.S. dialect.  For general discussion of similar
terms, see
   <a href="n.htm#nybble">nybble</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="check">check</a></h1><pre> n.  A hardware-detected error condition, most commonly
   used to refer to actual hardware failures rather than
   software-induced traps.  E.g., a `parity check' is the result of
   a hardware-detected parity error.  Recorded here because the word
   often humorously extended to non-technical problems. For example,
   the term `child check' has been used to refer to the problems
   caused by a small child who is curious to know what happens when
   s/he presses all the cute buttons on a computer's console (of
   course, this particular problem could have been prevented with
   <a href="m.htm#molly-guard">molly-guard</a>s).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="chemist">chemist</a></h1><pre> n.  [Cambridge] Someone who wastes computer time
   on <a href="n.htm#number-crunching">number-crunching</a> when you'd far rather the machine were
   doing something more productive, such as working out anagrams of
   your name or printing Snoopy calendars or running <a href="l.htm#life">life</a>

   chemistry.

   <a href="b.htm#bitty_box">bitty_box</a>es (see also <a href="p.htm#petscii">PETSCII</a>).  Thus, this usage may owe
   something to Philip K. Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream of

   novel is now sold under that title), in which a `chickenhead' is
   a mutant with below-average intelligence.

<h1><a name="chiclet_keyboard">chiclet keyboard</a></h1><pre> n.  A keyboard with a small, flat
   rectangular or lozenge-shaped rubber or plastic keys that look like
   pieces of chewing gum.  (Chiclets is the brand name of a variety of
   chewing gum that does in fact resemble the keys of chiclet
   keyboards.)  Used esp. to describe the original IBM PCjr
   keyboard.  Vendors unanimously liked these because they were cheap,
   and a lot of early portable and laptop products got launched using
   them.  Customers rejected the idea with almost equal unanimity, and
   chiclets are not often seen on anything larger than a digital watch
   any more.

   it's from Middle English but we're all too damned lazy to check the
   OED."  [I'm not.  It isn't. -- ESR] This term is alleged to have
   been inherited through 1960s underground comics, and to have been
   recently sighted in the Beavis and Butthead cartoons.

<h1><a name="choke">choke</a></h1><pre> v.  1. To reject input, often ungracefully.  "NULs
   make System V's `lpr(1)' choke."  "I tried building an
   <a href="e.htm#emacs">EMACS</a> binary to use <a href="x.htm#x">X</a>, but `cpp(1)' choked on all

<h1><a name="chomp">chomp</a></h1><pre> vi.  To <a href="l.htm#lose">lose</a>; specifically, to chew on something
   of which more was bitten off than one can.  Probably related to
   gnashing of teeth.  See <a href="b.htm#bagbiter">bagbiter</a>.

   A hand gesture commonly accompanies this.  To perform it, hold the
   four fingers together and place the thumb against their tips.  Now
   open and close your hand rapidly to suggest a biting action (much
   like what Pac-Man does in the classic video game, though this
   pantomime seems to predate that).  The gesture alone means `chomp
   chomp' (see "<a href="howwork.htm#verb_doubling">Verb_Doubling</a>" in the "<a href="howwork.htm#jargon_construction">Jargon_Construction</a>
   " section of the Prependices).  The hand may be
   pointed at the object of complaint, and for real emphasis you can
   use both hands at once.  Doing this to a person is equivalent to
   saying "You chomper!"  If you point the gesture at yourself, it
   is a humble but humorous admission of some failure.  You might do
   this if someone told you that a program you had written had failed
   in some surprising way and you felt dumb for not having anticipated
   it.

   depicts a girl (putatively Cinderella) sitting in front of a Rube
   Goldberg device and holding a rope coming out of it.  On the back
   cover, the device is in shambles after she has (inevitably) pulled

   with some small additions.  It is also known as `K&R C'.  The name
   came into use while C was being standardized by the ANSI X3J11
   committee.  Also `C Classic'.

   An analogous construction is sometimes applied elsewhere: thus,
   `X Classic', where X = Star Trek (referring to the original TV
   series) or X = PC (referring to IBM's ISA-bus machines as opposed
   to the PS/2 series).  This construction is especially used of

<h1><a name="clocks">clocks</a></h1><pre> n.  Processor logic cycles, so called because each
   generally corresponds to one clock pulse in the processor's timing.
   The relative execution times of instructions on a machine are
   usually discussed in clocks rather than absolute fractions of a
   second; one good reason for this is that clock speeds for various
   models of the machine may increase as technology improves, and it
   is usually the relative times one is interested in when discussing
   the instruction set.  Compare <a href="c.htm#cycle">cycle</a>.

<h1><a name="clone">clone</a></h1><pre> n.  1. An exact duplicate: "Our product is a clone of
   their product."  Implies a legal reimplementation from
   documentation or by reverse-engineering.  Also connotes lower
   price.  2. A shoddy, spurious copy: "Their product is a clone of
   our product."  3. A blatant ripoff, most likely violating
   copyright, patent, or trade secret protections: "Your product is a
   clone of my product."  This use implies legal action is pending.
   4. `PC clone:' a PC-BUS/ISA or EISA-compatible 80x86-based
   microcomputer (this use is sometimes spelled `klone' or
   `PClone').  These invariably have much more bang for the buck
   than the IBM archetypes they resemble.  5. In the construction
   `UNIX clone': An OS designed to deliver a UNIX-lookalike
   environment without UNIX license fees, or with additional
   `mission-critical' features such as support for real-time
   programming.  6. v. To make an exact copy of something.  "Let me
   clone that" might mean "I want to borrow that paper so I can make
   a photocopy" or "Let me get a copy of that file before you
   <a href="m.htm#mung">mung</a> it".

   (Synonymous with <a href="e.htm#evil">evil</a>.)  A weak, verbose, and flabby language
   used by <a href="c.htm#card_walloper">card_walloper</a>s to do boring mindless things on

   mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal
   offense." (from "Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal

<h1><a name="cobol_fingers">COBOL fingers</a></h1><pre> /koh'bol fing'grz/ n.  Reported from Sweden,
   a (hypothetical) disease one might get from coding in COBOL.  The

   <a href="c.htm#candygrammar">candygrammar</a>); thus it is alleged that programming too much in

   horrors.  In its native habitat, the code grinder often removes the
   suit jacket to reveal an underplumage consisting of button-down
   shirt (starch optional) and a tie.  In times of dire stress, the
   sleeves (if long) may be rolled up and the tie loosened about half
   an inch.  It seldom helps.  The <a href="c.htm#code_grinder">code_grinder</a>'s milieu is about

   burst into one's office and arrest one for violating programming
   style rules.  May be used either seriously, to underline a claim
   that a particular style violation is dangerous, or ironically, to
   suggest that the practice under discussion is condemned mainly by

<h1><a name="codewalker">codewalker</a></h1><pre> n.  A program component that traverses other

   code may turn into codewalkers.  As in "This new `vgrind'
   feature would require a codewalker to implement."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="coefficient_of_x">coefficient of X</a></h1><pre> n.  Hackish speech makes heavy use of
   pseudo-mathematical metaphors.  Four particularly important
   ones involve the terms `coefficient', `factor', `index', and
   `quotient'.  They are often loosely applied to things you cannot
   really be quantitative about, but there are subtle distinctions
   among them that convey information about the way the speaker
   mentally models whatever he or she is describing.

   `Foo factor' and `foo quotient' tend to describe something for
   which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical
   example is <a href="f.htm#fudge_factor">fudge_factor</a>.  It's not important how much you're
   fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed.
   You might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor.
   Quotient tends to imply that the property is a ratio of two
   opposing factors: "I would have won except for my luck quotient."
   This could also be "I would have won except for the luck factor",
   but using *quotient* emphasizes that it was bad luck
   overpowering good luck (or someone else's good luck overpowering
   your own).

   `Foo index' and `coefficient of foo' both tend to imply
   that foo is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that
   can be larger or smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or
   person as having a `high bogosity index', whereas you would be less
   likely to speak of a `high bogosity factor'.  `Foo index' suggests
   that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane
   cost-of-living index; `coefficient of foo' suggests that foo is a
   fundamental quantity, as in a coefficient of friction.  The choice
   between these terms is often one of personal preference; e.g., some
   people might feel that bogosity is a fundamental attribute and thus
   say `coefficient of bogosity', whereas others might feel it is a
   combination of factors and thus say `bogosity index'.

<h1><a name="cokebottle">cokebottle</a></h1><pre> /kohk'bot-l/ n.  Any very unusual character,
   particularly one you can't type because it it isn't on your
   keyboard.  MIT people used to complain about the
   `control-meta-cokebottle' commands at SAIL, and SAIL people
   complained right back about the `<a href="a.htm#altmode">altmode</a>-altmode-cokebottle'
   commands at MIT.  After the demise of the <a href="s.htm#space-cadet_keyboard">space-cadet_keyboard</a>
   , `cokebottle' faded away as serious usage, but was
   often invoked humorously to describe an (unspecified) weird or
   non-intuitive keystroke command.  It may be due for a second
   inning, however.  The OSF/Motif window manager, `mwm(1)', has
   a reserved keystroke for switching to the default set of
   keybindings and behavior.  This keystroke is (believe it or not)
   `control-meta-bang' (see <a href="b.htm#bang">bang</a>).  Since the exclamation point
   looks a lot like an upside down Coke bottle, Motif hackers have
   begun referring to this keystroke as `cokebottle'.  See also

<h1><a name="come_from">COME FROM</a></h1><pre> n.  A semi-mythical language construct dual to the
   `go to'; `COME FROM' &ltlabel&gt would cause the referenced label
   to act as a sort of trapdoor, so that if the program ever reached
   it control would quietly and <a href="a.htm#automagically">automagically</a> be transferred to
   the statement following the `COME FROM'.  `COME FROM'
   was first proposed in R.L. Clark's "A Linguistic Contribution
   to GOTO-less programming", which appeared in a 1973 <a href="d.htm#datamation">Datamation</a>
   issue (and was reprinted in the April 1984 issue of
   "Communications of the ACM").  This parodied the then-raging
   `structured programming' <a href="h.htm#holy_wars">holy_wars</a> (see <a href="c.htm#considered_harmful">considered_harmful</a>
   ).  Mythically, some variants are the `assigned COME
   FROM' and the `computed COME FROM' (parodying some nasty control
   constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of course,
   multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having
   more than one `COME FROM' statement coming from the same
   label.

   In some ways the FORTRAN `DO' looks like a `COME FROM'
   statement.  After the terminating statement number/`CONTINUE'
   is reached, control continues at the statement following the DO.
   Some generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than
   `CONTINUE') for the statement, leading to examples like:

           DO 10 I=1,LIMIT
     C imagine many lines of code here, leaving the
     C original DO statement lost in the spaghetti...
           WRITE(6,10) I,FROB(I)
      10   FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4)

   in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10.
   (This is particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear
   to have anything to do with the flow of control at all!)

   While sufficiently astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this
   form of `COME FROM' statement isn't completely general.  After
   all, control will eventually pass to the following statement.  The
   implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN,
   ca. 1975 (though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040
   ten years earlier).  The statement `AT 100' would perform a
   `COME FROM 100'.  It was intended strictly as a debugging aid,
   with dire consequences promised to anyone so deranged as to use it
   in production code.  More horrible things had already been
   perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only
   contemplate the `ALTER' verb in <a href="c.htm#cobol">COBOL</a>.

   `COME FROM' was supported under its own name for the first
   time 15 years later, in C-INTERCAL (see <a href="i.htm#intercal">INTERCAL</a>,
   <a href="r.htm#retrocomputing">retrocomputing</a>); knowledgeable observers are still reeling
   from the shock.

   done when the code is redundant or obsolete, but is being left in

<h1><a name="commonwealth_hackish">Commonwealth Hackish</a></h1><pre>: n.  Hacker jargon as spoken outside
   the U.S., esp. in the British Commonwealth.  It is reported that
   Commonwealth speakers are more likely to pronounce truncations like
   `char' and `soc', etc., as spelled (/char/, /sok/), as
   opposed to American /keir/ and /sohsh/.  Dots in <a href="n.htm#newsgroup">newsgroup</a>
   names (especially two-component names) tend to be pronounced more
   often (so soc.wibble is /sok dot wib'l/ rather than /sohsh
   wib'l/).  The prefix <a href="m.htm#meta">meta</a> may be pronounced /mee't*/;
   similarly, Greek letter beta is usually /bee't*/, zeta is usually
   /zee't*/, and so forth.  Preferred <a href="m.htm#metasyntactic_variable">metasyntactic_variable</a>s
   include <a href="b.htm#blurgle">blurgle</a>, `eek', `ook', `frodo', and
   `bilbo'; <a href="w.htm#wibble">wibble</a>, `wobble', and in emergencies
   `wubble'; `flob', `banana', `tom', `dick',
   `harry', `wombat', `frog', <a href="f.htm#fish">fish</a>, and so on and
   on (see <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a>, sense 4).

   Alternatives to verb doubling include suffixes `-o-rama',
   `frenzy' (as in feeding frenzy), and `city' (examples: "barf
   city!"  "hack-o-rama!"  "core dump frenzy!").  Finally, note
   that the American terms `parens', `brackets', and `braces' for (),
   [], and {} are uncommon; Commonwealth hackish prefers
   `brackets', `square brackets', and `curly brackets'.  Also, the

<h1><a name="compact">compact</a></h1><pre> adj.  Of a design, describes the valuable property
   that it can all be apprehended at once in one's head.  This
   generally means the thing created from the design can be used with
   greater facility and fewer errors than an equivalent tool that is
   not compact.  Compactness does not imply triviality or lack of
   power; for example, C is compact and FORTRAN is not, but C is more
   powerful than FORTRAN.  Designs become non-compact through
   accreting <a href="f.htm#feature">feature</a>s and <a href="c.htm#cruft">cruft</a> that don't merge cleanly
   into the overall design scheme (thus, some fans of <a href="c.htm#classic_c">Classic_C</a>

<h1><a name="computron">computron</a></h1><pre> /kom'pyoo-tron`/  n. 1. A notional unit of
   computing power combining instruction speed and storage capacity,
   dimensioned roughly in instructions-per-second times
   megabytes-of-main-store times megabytes-of-mass-storage.  "That
   machine can't run GNU EMACS, it doesn't have enough computrons!"
   This usage is usually found in metaphors that treat computing power
   as a fungible commodity good, like a crop yield or diesel
   horsepower.  See <a href="b.htm#bitty_box">bitty_box</a>, <a href="g.htm#get_a_real_computer!">Get_a_real_computer!</a>,
   <a href="t.htm#toy">toy</a>, <a href="c.htm#crank">crank</a>.  2. A mythical subatomic particle that bears
   the unit quantity of computation or information, in much the same
   way that an electron bears one unit of electric charge (see also
   <a href="b.htm#bogon">bogon</a>).  An elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons
   has been developed based on the physical fact that the molecules in
   a solid object move more rapidly as it is heated.  It is argued
   that an object melts because the molecules have lost their
   information about where they are supposed to be (that is, they have
   emitted computrons).  This explains why computers get so hot and
   require air conditioning; they use up computrons.  Conversely, it
   should be possible to cool down an object by placing it in the path
   of a computron beam.  It is believed that this may also explain why
   machines that work at the factory fail in the computer room: the
   computrons there have been all used up by the other hardware.
   (This theory probably owes something to the "Warlock" stories
   by Larry Niven, the best known being "What Good is a Glass
   Dagger?", in which magic is fueled by an exhaustible natural
   resource called `mana'.)

   envelopes.  Unlike the write protect tab, the condom (when left on)
   not only impedes the practice of <a href="s.htm#sex">SEX</a> but has also been shown
   to have a high failure rate as drive mechanisms attempt to access
   the disk -- and can even fatally frustrate insertion.  2. The
   protective cladding on a <a href="l.htm#light_pipe">light_pipe</a>.  3. `keyboard condom':
   A flexible, transparent plastic cover for a keyboard, designed to
   provide some protection against dust and <a href="p.htm#programming_fluid">programming_fluid</a>

<h1><a name="connector_conspiracy">connector conspiracy</a></h1><pre> n.  [probably came into prominence with
   the appearance of the KL-10 (one model of the <a href="p.htm#pdp-10">PDP-10</a>), none of
   whose connectors matched anything else] The tendency of
   manufacturers (or, by extension, programmers or purveyors of
   anything) to come up with new products that don't fit together with
   the old stuff, thereby making you buy either all new stuff or
   expensive interface devices.  The KL-10 Massbus connector was
   actually *patented* by <a href="d.htm#dec">DEC</a>, which reputedly refused to
   license the design and thus effectively locked third parties out of
   competition for the lucrative Massbus peripherals market.  This
   policy is a source of never-ending frustration for the diehards who
   maintain older PDP-10 or VAX systems.  Their CPUs work fine, but
   they are stuck with dying, obsolescent disk and tape drives with
   low capacity and high power requirements.

   (A closely related phenomenon, with a slightly different intent, is
   the habit manufacturers have of inventing new screw heads so that
   only Designated Persons, possessing the magic screwdrivers, can
   remove covers and make repairs or install options.  Older Apple
   Macintoshes took this one step further, requiring not only a hex
   wrench but a specialized case-cracking tool to open the box.)

   In these latter days of open-systems computing this term has fallen
   somewhat into disuse, to be replaced by the observation that
   "Standards are great!  There are so *many* of them to choose
   from!"  Compare <a href="b.htm#backward_combatability">backward_combatability</a>.

<h1><a name="cons">cons</a></h1><pre> /konz/ or /kons/  [from LISP] 1. vt. To add a new
   element to a specified list, esp. at the top.  "OK, cons picking
   a replacement for the console TTY onto the agenda."  2. `cons
   up': vt. To synthesize from smaller pieces: "to cons up an
   example".

   In LISP itself, `cons' is the most fundamental operation for
   building structures.  It takes any two objects and returns a
   `dot-pair' or two-branched tree with one object hanging from each
   branch.  Because the result of a cons is an object, it can be used
   to build binary trees of any shape and complexity.  Hackers think
   of it as a sort of universal constructor, and that is where the
   jargon meanings spring from.

<h1><a name="considered_harmful">considered harmful</a></h1><pre> adj.  Edsger W. Dijkstra's note in the
   March 1968 "Communications of the ACM", "Goto Statement
   Considered Harmful", fired the first salvo in the structured
   programming wars.  Amusingly, the ACM considered the resulting
   acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no longer
   print an article taking so assertive a position against a coding
   practice.  In the ensuing decades, a large number of both serious
   papers and parodies have borne titles of the form "X
   considered Y".  The structured-programming wars eventually blew
   over with the realization that both sides were wrong, but use of
   such titles has remained as a persistent minor in-joke (the
   `considered silly' found at various places in this lexicon is

<h1><a name="console">console</a></h1><pre>: n.  1. The operator's station of a <a href="m.htm#mainframe">mainframe</a>.
   In times past, this was a privileged location that conveyed godlike
   powers to anyone with fingers on its keys.  Under UNIX and other
   modern timesharing OSes, such privileges are guarded by passwords
   instead, and the console is just the <a href="t.htm#tty">tty</a> the system was booted
   from.  Some of the mystique remains, however, and it is traditional
   for sysadmins to post urgent messages to all users from the console
   (on UNIX, /dev/console).  2. On microcomputer UNIX boxes, the main
   screen and keyboard (as opposed to character-only terminals talking
   to a serial port).  Typically only the console can do real graphics

   to <a href="f.htm#flamage">flamage</a>, it more usually connotes derision for
   communication styles that exalt form over substance or are centered
   on concerns irrelevant to the subject ostensibly at hand.  Perhaps
   most used with reference to speeches by company presidents and
   other professional manipulators.  "Content-free?  Uh... that's
   anything printed on glossy paper."  (See also <a href="f.htm#four-color_glossies">four-color_glossies</a>

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="control-o">control-O</a></h1><pre> vi.  "Stop talking."  From the character used on

   therefore also used).  Control-S differs from <a href="c.htm#control-o">control-O</a> in
   that the person is asked to stop talking (perhaps because you are
   on the phone) but will be allowed to continue when you're ready to
   listen to him -- as opposed to control-O, which has more of the
   meaning of "Shut up."  Considered silly.

<h1><a name="conway's_law">Conway's Law</a></h1><pre> prov.  The rule that the organization of the

   on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler".

   The law was named after Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who
   wrote an assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE.  The name
   `SAVE' didn't stand for anything; it was just that you lost fewer
   card decks and listings because they all had SAVE written on them.

   Yes, *that* Andy Williams.  Seems he had a rather hip (by the
   standards of the day) TV variety show. One of the best parts of the
   show was the recurring `cookie bear' sketch. In these sketches, a
   guy in a bear suit tried all sorts of tricks to get a cookie out of
   Williams. The sketches would always end with Williams shrieking

<h1><a name="core_wars">Core Wars</a></h1><pre> n.  A game between `assembler' programs in a

   program by overwriting it.  Popularized by A. K. Dewdney's column
   in "Scientific American" magazine, this was actually devised
   by Victor Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and Dennis Ritchie in the
   early 1960s (their original game was called `Darwin' and ran on a

<h1><a name="cosmic_rays">cosmic rays</a></h1><pre> n.  Notionally, the cause of <a href="b.htm#bit_rot">bit_rot</a>.
   However, this is a semi-independent usage that may be invoked as a
   humorous way to <a href="h.htm#handwave">handwave</a> away any minor <a href="r.htm#randomness">randomness</a> that
   doesn't seem worth the bother of investigating.  "Hey, Eric -- I
   just got a burst of garbage on my <a href="t.htm#tube">tube</a>, where did that come
   from?"  "Cosmic rays, I guess."  Compare <a href="s.htm#sunspots">sunspots</a>,
   <a href="p.htm#phase_of_the_moon">phase_of_the_moon</a>.  The British seem to prefer the usage
   `cosmic showers'; `alpha particles' is also heard, because
   stray alpha particles passing through a memory chip can cause
   single-bit errors (this becomes increasingly more likely as memory
   sizes and densities increase).

   Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not
   (except occasionally in spaceborne computers).  Intel could not
   explain random bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis
   was cosmic rays.  So they created the World's Largest Lead Safe,
   using 25 tons of the stuff, and used two identical boards for
   testing.  One was placed in the safe, one outside.  The hypothesis
   was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit drops, they should see
   a statistically significant difference between the error rates on
   the two boards.  They did not observe such a difference.  Further
   investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due
   to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser
   degree uranium) in the encapsulation material.  Since it is
   impossible to eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly
   distributed through the earth's crust, with the statistically
   insignificant exception of uranium lodes) it became obvious that
   one has to design memories to withstand these hits.

<h1><a name="cp/m">CP/M</a></h1><pre>: /C-P-M/ n.  [Control Program/Monitor; later

   microcomputer <a href="o.htm#os">OS</a> written by hacker Gary Kildall for 8080- and
   Z80-based machines, very popular in the late 1970s but virtually
   wiped out by MS-DOS after the release of the IBM PC in 1981.
   Legend has it that Kildall's company blew its chance to write the
   OS for the IBM PC because Kildall decided to spend a day IBM's reps
   wanted to meet with him enjoying the perfect flying weather in his
   private plane.  Many of CP/M's features and conventions strongly

<h1><a name="cpu_wars">CPU Wars</a></h1><pre> /C-P-U worz/ n.  A 1979 large-format comic by
   Chas Andres chronicling the attempts of the brainwashed androids of
   IPM (Impossible to Program Machines) to conquer and destroy the
   peaceful denizens of HEC (Human Engineered Computers).  This rather
   transparent allegory featured many references to <a href="a.htm#advent">ADVENT</a> and
   the immortal line "Eat flaming death, minicomputer mongrels!"
   (uttered, of course, by an IPM stormtrooper).  It is alleged that
   the author subsequently received a letter of appreciation on IBM
   company stationery from the head of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
   Laboratories (then, as now, one of the few islands of true
   hackerdom in the IBM archipelago).  The lower loop of the B in the

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cracker">cracker</a></h1><pre> n.  One who breaks security on a system.  Coined
   ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of
   <a href="h.htm#hacker">hacker</a> (q.v., sense 8).  An earlier attempt to establish
   `worm' in this sense around 1981--82 on Usenet was largely a
   failure.

   Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against
   the theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings.  While it is
   expected that any real hacker will have done some playful cracking
   and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past <a href="l.htm#larval_stage">larval_stage</a>
    is expected to have outgrown the desire to do so except for
   immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example, if it's
   necessary to get around some security in order to get some work
   done).

   Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom
   than the <a href="m.htm#mundane">mundane</a> reader misled by sensationalistic journalism
   might expect.  Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit, very
   secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
   poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to
   describe *themselves* as hackers, most true hackers consider
   them a separate and lower form of life.

   Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't
   imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than
   breaking into someone else's has to be pretty <a href="l.htm#losing">losing</a>.  Some
   other reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the

<h1><a name="cracking">cracking</a></h1><pre> n.  The act of breaking into a computer system;
   what a <a href="c.htm#cracker">cracker</a> does.  Contrary to widespread myth, this does
   not usually involve some mysterious leap of hackerly brilliance,
   but rather persistence and the dogged repetition of a handful of
   fairly well-known tricks that exploit common weaknesses in the
   security of target systems.  Accordingly, most crackers are only
   mediocre hackers.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="crank">crank</a></h1><pre> vt.  [from automotive slang] Verb used to describe the

   of abuse used to describe TeX and LaTeX when they don't work (when
   used by TeXhackers), or all the time (by everyone else).  The
   non-TeX-enthusiasts generally dislike it because it is more verbose
   than other formatters (e.g. <a href="t.htm#troff">troff</a>) and because (particularly
   if the standard Computer Modern fonts are used) it generates vast
   output files.  See <a href="r.htm#religious_issues">religious_issues</a>, <a href="t.htm#tex">TeX</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="crash">crash</a></h1><pre>  1. n. A sudden, usually drastic failure.  Most often
   said of the <a href="s.htm#system">system</a> (q.v., sense 1), esp. of magnetic disk
   drives (the term originally described what happened when the air
   gap of a hard disk collapses).  "Three <a href="l.htm#luser">luser</a>s lost their
   files in last night's disk crash."  A disk crash that involves the
   read/write heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and
   scraping off the oxide may also be referred to as a `head crash',
   whereas the term `system crash' usually, though not always,
   implies that the operating system or other software was at fault.
   2. v. To fail suddenly.  "Has the system just crashed?"
   "Something crashed the OS!" See <a href="d.htm#down">down</a>.  Also used
   transitively to indicate the cause of the crash (usually a person
   or a program, or both).  "Those idiots playing <a href="s.htm#spacewar">SPACEWAR</a>
   crashed the system." 3. vi.  Sometimes said of people hitting the

   and many subsequent imitators (compare <a href="d.htm#die_horribly">die_horribly</a>).  Sun-3
   monitors losing the flyback transformer and lightning strikes on
   VAX-11/780 backplanes are notable crash and burn generators.  The
   construction `crash-and-burn machine' is reported for a computer
   used exclusively for alpha or <a href="b.htm#beta">beta</a> testing, or reproducing
   bugs (i.e., not for development).  The implication is that it
   wouldn't be such a disaster if that machine crashed, since only the

<h1><a name="cray">cray</a></h1><pre> /kray/ n.  1. (properly, capitalized) One of the line

   at all.  3. The <a href="c.htm#canonical">canonical</a> <a href="n.htm#number-crunching">number-crunching</a> machine.

   The term is actually the lowercased last name of Seymour Cray, a

   vivid legends surround him, some true and some admittedly invented
   by Cray Research brass to shape their corporate culture and image.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cray_instability">cray instability</a></h1><pre> n.  1. A shortcoming of a program or
   algorithm that manifests itself only when a large problem is being
   run on a powerful machine (see <a href="c.htm#cray">cray</a>).  Generally more subtle
   than bugs that can be detected in smaller problems running on a
   workstation or mini.  2. More specifically, a shortcoming of
   algorithms which are well behaved when run on gentle floating point
   hardware (such as IEEE-standard or DEC) but which break down badly
   when exposed to a Cray's unique `rounding' rules.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="crayon">crayon</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Someone who works on Cray supercomputers.
   More specifically, it implies a programmer, probably of the CDC
   ilk, probably male, and almost certainly wearing a tie
   (irrespective of gender).  Systems types who have a UNIX background
   tend not to be described as crayons.  2. A <a href="c.htm#computron">computron</a> (sense 2)
   that participates only in <a href="n.htm#number-crunching">number-crunching</a>.  3. A unit of
   computational power equal to that of a single Cray-1.  There is a
   standard joke about this usage that derives from an old Crayola
   crayon promotional gimmick: When you buy 64 crayons you get a free
   sharpener.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="creationism">creationism</a></h1><pre> n.  The (false) belief that large, innovative
   software designs can be completely specified in advance and then
   painlessly magicked out of the void by the normal efforts of a team
   of normally talented programmers.  In fact, experience has shown
   repeatedly that good designs arise only from evolutionary,
   exploratory interaction between one (or at most a small handful of)
   exceptionally able designer(s) and an active user population ---
   and that the first try at a big new idea is always wrong.
   Unfortunately, because these truths don't fit the planning models
   beloved of <a href="m.htm#management">management</a>, they are generally ignored.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="creep">creep</a></h1><pre> v.  To advance, grow, or multiply inexorably.  In

   evoking the creeping horrors of low-budget monster movies.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="creeping_elegance">creeping elegance</a></h1><pre> n.  Describes a tendency for parts of a
   design to become <a href="e.htm#elegant">elegant</a> past the point of diminishing return,

<h1><a name="creeping_featurism">creeping featurism</a></h1><pre> /kree'ping fee'chr-izm/ n. 
   1. Describes a systematic tendency to load more <a href="c.htm#chrome">chrome</a> and
   <a href="f.htm#feature">feature</a>s onto systems at the expense of whatever elegance they
   may have possessed when originally designed.  See also <a href="f.htm#feeping_creaturism">feeping_creaturism</a>
   .  "You know, the main problem with <a href="b.htm#bsd">BSD</a> UNIX has
   always been creeping featurism."  2. More generally, the tendency
   for anything complicated to become even more complicated because
   people keep saying "Gee, it would be even better if it had this
   feature too".  (See <a href="f.htm#feature">feature</a>.)  The result is usually a
   patchwork because it grew one ad-hoc step at a time, rather than
   being planned.  Planning is a lot of work, but it's easy to add
   just one extra little feature to help someone ... and then
   another ... and another.... When creeping featurism gets
   out of hand, it's like a cancer.  Usually this term is used to
   describe computer programs, but it could also be said of the
   federal government, the IRS 1040 form, and new cars.  A similar
   phenomenon sometimes afflicts conscious redesigns; see

   Variant of <a href="c.htm#creeping_featurism">creeping_featurism</a>, with its own spoonerization:
   `feeping creaturitis'.  Some people like to reserve this form for
   the disease as it actually manifests in software or hardware, as
   opposed to the lurking general tendency in designers' minds.
   (After all, -ism means `condition' or `pursuit of', whereas
   -itis usually means `inflammation of'.)

<h1><a name="cretin">cretin</a></h1><pre> /kret'in/ or /kree'tn/ n.  Congenital <a href="l.htm#loser">loser</a>;
   an obnoxious person; someone who can't do anything right.  It has
   been observed that many American hackers tend to favor the British
   pronunciation /kret'in/ over standard American /kree'tn/; it is
   thought this may be due to the insidious phonetic influence of
   Monty Python's Flying Circus.

<h1><a name="crippleware">crippleware</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Software that has some important
   functionality deliberately removed, so as to entice potential users
   to pay for a working version.  2. [Cambridge] Variety of
   <a href="g.htm#guiltware">guiltware</a> that exhorts you to donate to some charity (compare
   <a href="c.htm#careware">careware</a>, <a href="n.htm#nagware">nagware</a>).  3. Hardware deliberately crippled,
   which can be upgraded to a more expensive model by a trivial change
   (e.g., cutting a jumper).

   An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is Intel's 486SX
   chip, which is a standard 486DX chip with the co-processor dyked
   out (in some early versions it was present but disabled).  To
   upgrade, you buy a complete 486DX chip with *working*
   co-processor (its identity thinly veiled by a different pinout) and
   plug it into the board's expansion socket.  It then disables the
   SX, which becomes a fancy power sink.  Don't you love Intel?

<h1><a name="critical_mass">critical mass</a></h1><pre> n.  In physics, the minimum amount of
   fissionable material required to sustain a chain reaction.  Of a
   software product, describes a condition of the software such that
   fixing one bug introduces one plus <a href="e.htm#epsilon">epsilon</a> bugs.  (This malady
   has many causes: <a href="c.htm#creeping_featurism">creeping_featurism</a>, ports to too many
   disparate environments, poor initial design, etc.)  When software
   achieves critical mass, it can never be fixed; it can only be
   discarded and rewritten.

<h1><a name="crlf">crlf</a></h1><pre> /ker'l*f/, sometimes /kru'l*f/ or /C-R-L-F/ n. 
   (often capitalized as `CRLF') A carriage return (CR, ASCII 0001101)
   followed by a line feed (LF, ASCII 0001010).  More loosely,
   whatever it takes to get you from the end of one line of text to
   the beginning of the next line.  See <a href="n.htm#newline">newline</a>, <a href="t.htm#terpri">terpri</a>.

<h1><a name="crock">crock</a></h1><pre> n.  [from the American scatologism `crock of shit']
   1. An awkward feature or programming technique that ought to be
   made cleaner.  For example, using small integers to represent error
   codes without the program interpreting them to the user (as in, for
   example, UNIX `make(1)', which returns code 139 for a process
   that dies due to <a href="s.htm#segfault">segfault</a>).  2. A technique that works
   acceptably, but which is quite prone to failure if disturbed in the
   least.  For example, a too-clever programmer might write an
   assembler which mapped instruction mnemonics to numeric opcodes
   algorithmically, a trick which depends far too intimately on the
   particular bit patterns of the opcodes.  (For another example of
   programming with a dependence on actual opcode values, see <a href="appa.htm#the_story_of_mel,_a_real_programmer">The_Story_of_Mel,_a_Real_Programmer</a>
    in Appendix A.)  Many crocks
   have a tightly woven, almost completely unmodifiable structure.
   See <a href="k.htm#kluge">kluge</a>, <a href="b.htm#brittle">brittle</a>.  The adjectives `crockish' and
   `crocky', and the nouns `crockishness' and `crockitude', are

<h1><a name="cross-post">cross-post</a></h1><pre> [Usenet] vi.  To post a single article
   simultaneously to several newsgroups.  Distinguished from posting
   the article repeatedly, once to each newsgroup, which causes people
   to see it multiple times (which is very bad form).  Gratuitous
   cross-posting without a Followup-To line directing responses to a
   single followup group is frowned upon, as it tends to cause
   <a href="f.htm#followup">followup</a> articles to go to inappropriate newsgroups when

<h1><a name="cruft">cruft</a></h1><pre> /kruhft/  [back-formation from <a href="c.htm#crufty">crufty</a>] 1. n. An
   unpleasant substance.  The dust that gathers under your bed is
   cruft; the TMRC Dictionary correctly noted that attacking it with a

   construction.  3. vt. [from `hand cruft', pun on `hand craft']
   To write assembler code for something normally (and better) done by
   a compiler (see <a href="h.htm#hand-hacking">hand-hacking</a>).  4. n. Excess; superfluous
   junk; used esp. of redundant or superseded code.  5. [University
   of Wisconsin] n. Cruft is to hackers as gaggle is to geese; that
   is, at UW one properly says "a cruft of hackers".

   This term is one of the oldest in the jargon and no one is sure of
   its etymology, but it is suggestive that there is a Cruft Hall at
   Harvard University which is part of the old physics building; it's
   said to have been the physics department's radar lab during WWII.
   To this day (early 1993) the windows appear to be full of random
   techno-junk.  MIT or Lincoln Labs people may well have coined the
   term as a knock on the competition.

   `crusty' or `cruddy'] 1. Poorly built, possibly over-complex.
   The <a href="c.htm#canonical">canonical</a> example is "This is standard old crufty
   <a href="d.htm#dec">DEC</a> software".  In fact, one fanciful theory of the origin of
   `crufty' holds that was originally a mutation of `crusty'
   applied to DEC software so old that the `s' characters were tall
   and skinny, looking more like `f' characters.  2. Unpleasant,
   especially to the touch, often with encrusted junk.  Like spilled
   coffee smeared with peanut butter and catsup.  3. Generally
   unpleasant.  4. (sometimes spelled `cruftie') n. A small crufty
   object (see <a href="f.htm#frob">frob</a>); often one that doesn't fit well into the
   scheme of things.  "A LISP property list is a good place to store
   crufties (or, collectively, <a href="r.htm#random">random</a> cruft)."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="crumb">crumb</a></h1><pre> n.  Two binary digits; a <a href="q.htm#quad">quad</a>.  Larger than a
   <a href="b.htm#bit">bit</a>, smaller than a <a href="n.htm#nybble">nybble</a>.  Considered silly.
   Syn. <a href="t.htm#tayste">tayste</a>.  General discussion of such terms is under
   <a href="n.htm#nybble">nybble</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="crunch">crunch</a></h1><pre> 1. vi.  To process, usually in a time-consuming or
   complicated way.  Connotes an essentially trivial operation that is
   nonetheless painful to perform.  The pain may be due to the
   triviality's being embedded in a loop from 1 to 1,000,000,000.
   "FORTRAN programs do mostly <a href="n.htm#number-crunching">number-crunching</a>."  2. vt. To
   reduce the size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces bit
   configurations completely unrelated to the original data, such as
   by a Huffman code.  (The file ends up looking something like a
   paper document would if somebody crunched the paper into a wad.)
   Since such compression usually takes more computations than simpler
   methods such as run-length encoding, the term is doubly
   appropriate.  (This meaning is usually used in the construction
   `file crunch(ing)' to distinguish it from <a href="n.htm#number-crunching">number-crunching</a>.)
   See <a href="c.htm#compress">compress</a>.  3. n. The character `#'.  Used at XEROX
   and CMU, among other places.  See <a href="a.htm#ascii">ASCII</a>.  4. vt. To squeeze
   program source into a minimum-size representation that will still
   compile or execute.  The term came into being specifically for a
   famous program on the BBC micro that crunched BASIC source in order
   to make it run more quickly (it was a wholly interpretive BASIC, so
   the number of characters mattered).  <a href="o.htm#obfuscated_c_contest">Obfuscated_C_Contest</a>
   entries are often crunched; see the first example under that entry.

   bogged down in a serious <a href="g.htm#grovel">grovel</a>.  Also describes a notional
   sound made by groveling hardware.  See <a href="w.htm#wugga_wugga">wugga_wugga</a>, <a href="g.htm#grind">grind</a>

<h1><a name="cryppie">cryppie</a></h1><pre> /krip'ee/ n.  A cryptographer.  One who hacks or
   implements cryptographic software or hardware.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ctss">CTSS</a></h1><pre> /C-T-S-S/ n.  Compatible Time-Sharing System.  An
   early (1963) experiment in the design of interactive time-sharing
   operating systems, ancestral to <a href="m.htm#multics">Multics</a>, <a href="u.htm#unix">UNIX</a>, and
   <a href="i.htm#its">ITS</a>.  The name <a href="i.htm#its">ITS</a> (Incompatible Time-sharing System)
   was a hack on CTSS, meant both as a joke and to express some basic
   differences in philosophy about the way I/O services should be
   presented to user programs.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cty">CTY</a></h1><pre> /sit'ee/ or /C-T-Y/ n.  [MIT] The terminal
   physically associated with a computer's system <a href="c.htm#console">console</a>.  The
   term is a contraction of `Console <a href="t.htm#tty">tty</a>', that is, `Console
   TeleTYpe'.  This <a href="i.htm#its">ITS</a>- and <a href="t.htm#tops-10">TOPS-10</a>-associated term has
   become less common, as most UNIX hackers simply refer to the CTY as
   `the console'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cube">cube</a></h1><pre> n.  1. [short for `cubicle'] A module in the
   open-plan offices used at many programming shops.  "I've got the
   manuals in my cube."  2. A NeXT machine (which resembles a
   matte-black cube).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cubing">cubing</a></h1><pre> vi.  [parallel with `tubing'] 1. Hacking on an IPSC
   (Intel Personal SuperComputer) hypercube.  "Louella's gone cubing
   *again*!!"  2. Hacking Rubik's Cube or related puzzles,
   either physically or mathematically.  3. An indescribable form of
   self-torture (see sense 1 or 2).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cursor_dipped_in_x">cursor dipped in X</a></h1><pre> n.  There are a couple of metaphors in
   English of the form `pen dipped in X' (perhaps the most common
   values of X are `acid', `bile', and `vitriol').  These map
   over neatly to this hackish usage (the cursor being what moves,
   leaving letters behind, when one is composing on-line).  "Talk
   about a <a href="n.htm#nastygram">nastygram</a>!  He must've had his cursor dipped in acid
   when he wrote that one!"

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cuspy">cuspy</a></h1><pre> /kuhs'pee/ adj.  [WPI: from the <a href="d.htm#dec">DEC</a>
   abbreviation CUSP, for `Commonly Used System Program', i.e., a
   utility program used by many people] 1. (of a program)
   Well-written.  2. Functionally excellent.  A program that performs
   well and interfaces well to users is cuspy.  See <a href="r.htm#rude">rude</a>.
   3. [NYU] Said of an attractive woman, especially one regarded as
   available.  Implies a certain curvaceousness.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cut_a_tape">cut a tape</a></h1><pre> vi.  To write a software or document distribution
   on magnetic tape for shipment.  Has nothing to do with physically
   cutting the medium!  Early versions of this lexicon claimed that
   one never analogously speaks of `cutting a disk', but this has
   since been reported as live usage.  Related slang usages are
   mainstream business's `cut a check', the recording industry's
   `cut a record', and the military's `cut an order'.

   All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete
   recording and duplication technologies.  The first stage in
   manufacturing an old-style vinyl record involved cutting grooves in
   a stamping die with a precision lathe.  More mundanely, the
   dominant technology for mass duplication of paper documents in
   pre-photocopying days involved "cutting a stencil", punching away
   portions of the wax overlay on a silk screen.  More directly,
   paper tape with holes punched in it was an important early storage
   medium.

<h1><a name="cybercrud">cybercrud</a></h1><pre> /si:'ber-kruhd/ n.  1. [coined by Ted Nelson]
   Obfuscatory tech-talk.  Verbiage with a high <a href="m.htm#mego">MEGO</a> factor.  The
   computer equivalent of bureaucratese.  2. Incomprehensible stuff
   embedded in email.  First there were the "Received" headers that
   show how mail flows through systems, then MIME (Multi-purpose
   Internet Mail Extensions) headers and part boundaries, and now huge
   blocks of hex for PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) or PGP (Pretty Good
   Privacy) digital signatures and certificates of authenticity.  This
   stuff all services a purpose and good user interfaces should hide
   it, but all too often users are forced to wade through it.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a></h1><pre> /si:'ber-puhnk/ n.,adj.  [orig. by SF writer
   Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A subgenre of SF
   launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel
   "Neuromancer" (though its roots go back through Vernor Vinge's
   "True Names" (see the <a href="appb.htm#bibliography">Bibliography</a> in Appendix C) to
   John Brunner's 1975 novel "The Shockwave Rider").  Gibson's
   near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker
   culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and
   hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both
   irritatingly na"ive and tremendously stimulating.  Gibson's work
   was widely imitated, in particular by the short-lived but
   innovative "Max Headroom" TV series.  See <a href="c.htm#cyberspace">cyberspace</a>,
   <a href="i.htm#ice">ice</a>, <a href="j.htm#jack_in">jack_in</a>, <a href="g.htm#go_flatline">go_flatline</a>.

   Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or
   fashion trend that calls itself `cyberpunk', associated especially
   with the rave/techno subculture.  Hackers have mixed feelings about
   this.  On the one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to
   be shallow trendoids in black leather who have substituted
   enthusiastic blathering about technology for actually learning and
   *doing* it.  Attitude is no substitute for competence.  On the
   other hand, at least cyberpunks are excited about the right things
   and properly respectful of hacking talent in those who have it.
   The general consensus is to tolerate them politely in hopes that
   they'll attract people who grow into being true hackers.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cyberspace">cyberspace</a></h1><pre> /si:'ber-spays/ n.  1. Notional
   `information-space' loaded with visual cues and navigable with
   brain-computer interfaces called `cyberspace decks'; a
   characteristic prop of <a href="appc.htm#cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> SF.  At the time of this
   writing (mid-1991), serious efforts to construct <a href="v.htm#virtual_reality">virtual_reality</a>
    interfaces modeled explicitly on Gibsonian cyberspace are
   already under way, using more conventional devices such as glove
   sensors and binocular TV headsets.  Few hackers are prepared to
   deny outright the possibility of a cyberspace someday evolving out
   of the network (see <a href="n.htm#network,_the">network,_the</a>).  2. Occasionally, the
   metaphoric location of the mind of a person in <a href="h.htm#hack_mode">hack_mode</a>.
   Some hackers report experiencing strong eidetic imagery when in
   hack mode; interestingly, independent reports from multiple sources
   suggest that there are common features to the experience.  In
   particular, the dominant colors of this subjective `cyberspace'
   are often gray and silver, and the imagery often involves
   constellations of marching dots, elaborate shifting patterns of
   lines and angles, or moire patterns.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cycle">cycle</a></h1><pre>  1. n. The basic unit of computation.  What every
   hacker wants more of (noted hacker Bill Gosper describes himself as
   a "cycle junkie"). One can describe an instruction as taking so
   many `clock cycles'.  Often the computer can access its memory
   once on every clock cycle, and so one speaks also of `memory
   cycles'.  These are technical meanings of <a href="c.htm#cycle">cycle</a>.  The jargon
   meaning comes from the observation that there are only so many
   cycles per second, and when you are sharing a computer the cycles
   get divided up among the users.  The more cycles the computer
   spends working on your program rather than someone else's, the
   faster your program will run.  That's why every hacker wants more
   cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to
   respond.  2. By extension, a notional unit of *human* thought
   power, emphasizing that lots of things compete for the typical
   hacker's think time.  "I refused to get involved with the Rubik's
   Cube back when it was big.  Knew I'd burn too many cycles on it if
   I let myself."  3. vt. Syn. <a href="b.htm#bounce">bounce</a> (sense 4), <a href="notaz.htm#120_reset">120_reset</a>;
   from the phrase `cycle power'. "Cycle the machine again, that
   serial port's still hung."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cycle_crunch">cycle crunch</a></h1><pre> n.  A situation wherein the number of people
   trying to use a computer simultaneously has reached the point where
   no one can get enough cycles because they are spread too thin and
   the system has probably begun to <a href="t.htm#thrash">thrash</a>.  This scenario is an
   inevitable result of Parkinson's Law applied to timesharing.
   Usually the only solution is to buy more computer.  Happily, this
   has rapidly become easier since the mid-1980s, so much so that the
   very term `cycle crunch' now has a faintly archaic flavor; most
   hackers now use workstations or personal computers as opposed to
   traditional timesharing systems.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cycle_drought">cycle drought</a></h1><pre> n.  A scarcity of cycles.  It may be due to a
   <a href="c.htm#cycle_crunch">cycle_crunch</a>, but it could also occur because part of the
   computer is temporarily not working, leaving fewer cycles to go
   around.  "The <a href="h.htm#high_moby">high_moby</a> is <a href="d.htm#down">down</a>, so we're running with
   only half the usual amount of memory.  There will be a cycle
   drought until it's fixed."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cycle_of_reincarnation">cycle of reincarnation</a></h1><pre> n.  [coined in a paper by T. H. Myer
   and I.E. Sutherland "On the Design of Display Processors", Comm.
   ACM, Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used to refer to a well-known
   effect whereby function in a computing system family is migrated
   out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed, then the
   peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its job,
   then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two
   asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function
   back into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again.

   Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in
   graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in
   communications and floating-point processors.  Also known as `the
   Wheel of Life', `the Wheel of Samsara', and other variations of
   the basic Hindu/Buddhist theological idea.  See also <a href="b.htm#blitter">blitter</a>,

   such as editing are done on other machines on the network, such as
   workstations.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="cypherpunk">cypherpunk</a></h1><pre> n.  [from <a href="appc.htm#cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a>] One interested in the
   uses of encryption using electronic cyphers for enhancing personal
   privacy and guarding against tyranny by centralized, authoritarian
   power structures, especially government.  There is an active
   cypherpunks mailing list at cypherpunks-request@toad.com
   coordinating work on public-key encryption freeware, privacy, and
   digital cash.  See also <a href="t.htm#tentacle">tentacle</a>.
