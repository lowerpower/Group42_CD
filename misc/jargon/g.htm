<h1><a name="g-file">g-file</a></h1><pre> n.  [Commodore BBS culture] Any file that is written with the
   intention of being read by a human rather than a machine, such as
the Jargon
   File, documentation, humor files, hacker lore and technical files.

   This term survives from the nearly-forgotten Commodore 64
underground
   and BBS community. In the early 80s, C-Net had emerged as the most
popular
   C64 BBS software for systems which encouraged messaging (as opposed
to file
   transfer).  There were three main options for files: Program files
   (p-files), which served the same function as `doors' in today's
systems,
   UD files (the user upload/download section), and G-files.  Anything
that
   was meant to be read was included in G-files.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gabriel">gabriel</a></h1><pre> /gay'bree-*l/ n.  [for Dick Gabriel, SAIL LISP
   hacker and volleyball fanatic] An unnecessary (in the opinion of
   the opponent) stalling tactic, e.g., tying one's shoelaces or
   combing one's hair repeatedly, asking the time, etc.  Also used to
   refer to the perpetrator of such tactics.  Also, `pulling a
   Gabriel', `Gabriel mode'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gag">gag</a></h1><pre> vi.  Equivalent to <a href="c.htm#choke">choke</a>, but connotes more
   disgust. "Hey, this is FORTRAN code.  No wonder the C compiler
   gagged."  See also <a href="b.htm#barf">barf</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gang_bang">gang bang</a></h1><pre> n.  The use of large numbers of loosely coupled
   programmers in an attempt to wedge a great many features into a
   product in a short time.  Though there have been memorable gang
   bangs (e.g., that over-the-weekend assembler port mentioned in
   Steven Levy's "Hackers"), most are perpetrated by large
   companies trying to meet deadlines; the inevitable result is
   enormous buggy masses of code entirely lacking in
   <a href="o.htm#orthogonal">orthogonal</a>ity.  When market-driven managers make a list of all
   the features the competition has and assign one programmer to
   implement each, the probability of maintaining a coherent (or even
   functional) design goes infinitesimal.  See also <a href="f.htm#firefighting">firefighting</a>,

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="garbage_collect">garbage collect</a></h1><pre> vi.  (also `garbage collection', n.) See
   <a href="g.htm#gc">GC</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="garply">garply</a></h1><pre> /gar'plee/ n.  [Stanford] Another metasyntactic
   variable (see <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a>); once popular among SAIL hackers.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gas">gas</a></h1><pre>  [as in `gas chamber'] 1. interj. A term of disgust
   and hatred, implying that gas should be dispensed in generous
   quantities, thereby exterminating the source of irritation.  "Some
   loser just reloaded the system for no reason!  Gas!"  2. interj. A
   suggestion that someone or something ought to be flushed out of
   mercy.  "The system's getting <a href="w.htm#wedged">wedged</a> every few minutes.
   Gas!"  3. vt.  To <a href="f.htm#flush">flush</a> (sense 1).  "You should gas that old
   crufty software."  4. [IBM] n. Dead space in nonsequentially
   organized files that was occupied by data that has since been
   deleted; the compression operation that removes it is called
   `degassing' (by analogy, perhaps, with the use of the same term
   in vacuum technology).  5. [IBM] n. Empty space on a disk that has
   been clandestinely allocated against future need.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gaseous">gaseous</a></h1><pre> adj.  Deserving of being <a href="g.htm#gas">gas</a>sed.  Disseminated
   by Geoff Goodfellow while at SRI; became particularly popular after
   the Moscone-Milk killings in San Francisco, when it was learned
   that the defendant Dan White (a politician who had supported
   Proposition 7) would get the gas chamber under Proposition 7 if
   convicted of first-degree murder (he was eventually convicted of
   manslaughter).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gawble">gawble</a></h1><pre> n.  See <a href="c.htm#chawmp">chawmp</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gc">GC</a></h1><pre> /G-C/  [from LISP terminology; `Garbage Collect']
   1. vt. To clean up and throw away useless things.  "I think I'll
   GC the top of my desk today."  When said of files, this is
   equivalent to <a href="g.htm#gfr">GFR</a>.  2. vt. To recycle, reclaim, or put to
   another use.  3. n. An instantiation of the garbage collector
   process.

   `Garbage collection' is computer-science techspeak for a
   particular class of strategies for dynamically but transparently
   reallocating computer memory (i.e., without requiring explicit
   allocation and deallocation by higher-level software).  One such
   strategy involves periodically scanning all the data in memory and
   determining what is no longer accessible; useless data items are
   then discarded so that the memory they occupy can be recycled and
   used for another purpose.  Implementations of the LISP language
   usually use garbage collection.

   In jargon, the full phrase is sometimes heard but the <a href="a.htm#abbrev">abbrev</a> is
   more frequently used because it is shorter.  Note that there is an
   ambiguity in usage that has to be resolved by context: "I'm going
   to garbage-collect my desk" usually means to clean out the
   drawers, but it could also mean to throw away or recycle the desk
   itself.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gcos">GCOS</a></h1><pre>: /jee'kohs/ n.  A <a href="q.htm#quick-and-dirty">quick-and-dirty</a> <a href="c.htm#clone">clone</a> of
   System/360 DOS that emerged from GE around 1970; originally called
   GECOS (the General Electric Comprehensive Operating System).  Later
   kluged to support primitive timesharing and transaction processing.
   After the buyout of GE's computer division by Honeywell, the name
   was changed to General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS).
   Other OS groups at Honeywell began referring to it as `God's Chosen
   Operating System', allegedly in reaction to the GCOS crowd's
   uninformed and snotty attitude about the superiority of their
   product.  All this might be of zero interest, except for two facts:
   (1) The GCOS people won the political war, and this led in the
   orphaning and eventual death of Honeywell <a href="m.htm#multics">Multics</a>, and (2)
   GECOS/GCOS left one permanent mark on UNIX.  Some early UNIX
   systems at Bell Labs used GCOS machines for print spooling and
   various other services; the field added to `/etc/passwd' to
   carry GCOS ID information was called the `GECOS field' and
   survives today as the `pw_gecos' member used for the user's
   full name and other human-ID information.  GCOS later played a
   major role in keeping Honeywell a dismal also-ran in the mainframe
   market, and was itself ditched for UNIX in the late 1980s when
   Honeywell retired its aging <a href="b.htm#big_iron">big_iron</a> designs.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gecos">GECOS</a></h1><pre>: /jee'kohs/ n.  See <a href="g.htm#gcos">GCOS</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gedanken">gedanken</a></h1><pre> /g*-dahn'kn/ adj.  Ungrounded; impractical; not
   well-thought-out; untried; untested.

   `Gedanken' is a German word for `thought'.  A thought
   experiment is one you carry out in your head.  In physics, the term
   `gedanken experiment' is used to refer to an experiment that is
   impractical to carry out, but useful to consider because it can
   be reasoned about theoretically.  (A classic gedanken experiment of
   relativity theory involves thinking about a man in an elevator
   accelerating through space.)  Gedanken experiments are very useful
   in physics, but must be used with care.  It's too easy to idealize
   away some important aspect of the real world in constructing the
   `apparatus'.

   Among hackers, accordingly, the word has a pejorative connotation.
   It is typically used of a project, especially one in artificial
   intelligence research, that is written up in grand detail
   (typically as a Ph.D.  thesis) without ever being implemented to
   any great extent.  Such a project is usually perpetrated by people
   who aren't very good hackers or find programming distasteful or are
   just in a hurry.  A `gedanken thesis' is usually marked by an
   obvious lack of intuition about what is programmable and what is
   not, and about what does and does not constitute a clear
   specification of an algorithm.  See also <a href="a.htm#ai-complete">AI-complete</a>,
   <a href="d.htm#dwim">DWIM</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="geef">geef</a></h1><pre> v.  [ostensibly from `gefingerpoken']
   vt. Syn. <a href="m.htm#mung">mung</a>.  See also <a href="b.htm#blinkenlights">blinkenlights</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="geek_code">geek code</a></h1><pre> n.  A set of codes commonly used in <a href="s.htm#sig_block">sig_block</a>s to
   broadcast the interests, skills, and aspirations of the poster.
   Features a G at the left margin followed by numerous letter codes,
   often suffixed with plusses or minuses.  Because many net users are
   involved in computer science, the most common prefix is `GCS'.  To
   see a copy of the current Code of the Geeks, finger
   hayden@vax1.mankato.msus.edu. See also <a href="c.htm#computer_geek">computer_geek</a>
   . .

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="geek_out">geek out</a></h1><pre> vi.  To temporarily enter techno-nerd mode while in
   a non-hackish context, for example at parties held near computer
   equipment.  Especially used when you need to do or say something
   highly technical and don't have time to explain: "Pardon me while
   I geek out for a moment."  See <a href="c.htm#computer_geek">computer_geek</a>; see also
   <a href="p.htm#propeller_head">propeller_head</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gen">gen</a></h1><pre> /jen/ n.,v.  Short for <a href="g.htm#generate">generate</a>, used frequently
   in both spoken and written contexts.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gender_mender">gender mender</a></h1><pre> n.  A cable connector shell with either two
   male or two female connectors on it, used to correct the mismatches
   that result when some <a href="l.htm#loser">loser</a> didn't understand the RS232C
   specification and the distinction between DTE and DCE.  Used
   esp. for RS-232C parts in either the original D-25 or the IBM
   PC's bogus D-9 format.  Also called `gender bender', `gender
   blender', `sex changer', and even `homosexual adapter';
   however, there appears to be some confusion as to whether a `male
   homosexual adapter' has pins on both sides (is doubly male) or
   sockets on both sides (connects two males).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="general_public_virus">General Public Virus</a></h1><pre> n.  Pejorative name for some versions
   of the <a href="g.htm#gnu">GNU</a> project <a href="c.htm#copyleft">copyleft</a> or General Public License
   (GPL), which requires that any tools or <a href="a.htm#app">app</a>s incorporating
   copylefted code must be source-distributed on the same
   counter-commercial terms as GNU stuff.  Thus it is alleged that the
   copyleft `infects' software generated with GNU tools, which may
   in turn infect other software that reuses any of its code.  The
   Free Software Foundation's official position as of January 1991 is
   that copyright law limits the scope of the GPL to "programs
   textually incorporating significant amounts of GNU code", and that
   the `infection' is not passed on to third parties unless actual
   GNU source is transmitted (as in, for example, use of the Bison
   parser skeleton).  Nevertheless, widespread suspicion that the
   <a href="c.htm#copyleft">copyleft</a> language is `boobytrapped' has caused many
   developers to avoid using GNU tools and the GPL.  Recent (July
   1991) changes in the language of the version 2.00 license may
   eliminate this problem.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="generate">generate</a></h1><pre> vt.  To produce something according to an algorithm
   or program or set of rules, or as a (possibly unintended) side
   effect of the execution of an algorithm or program.  The opposite
   of <a href="p.htm#parse">parse</a>.  This term retains its mechanistic connotations
   (though often humorously) when used of human behavior.  "The guy
   is rational most of the time, but mention nuclear energy around him
   and he'll generate <a href="i.htm#infinite">infinite</a> flamage."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="genius_from_mars_technique">Genius From Mars Technique</a></h1><pre> n.  [TMRC] A visionary quality
   which enables one to ignore the standard approach and come up with
   a totally unexpected new algorithm.  To approach a problem from an
   offbeat angle that no one has ever thought of before, but that in
   retrospect makes total sense.  Compare <a href="g.htm#grok">grok</a>, <a href="z.htm#zen">zen</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gensym">gensym</a></h1><pre> /jen'sim/  [from MacLISP for `generated symbol']
   1. v.  To invent a new name for something temporary, in such a way
   that the name is almost certainly not in conflict with one already
   in use.  2. n.  The resulting name.  The canonical form of a gensym
   is `Gnnnn' where nnnn represents a number; any LISP hacker would
   recognize G0093 (for example) as a gensym.  3. A freshly generated
   data structure with a gensymmed name.  Gensymmed names are useful
   for storing or uniquely identifying crufties (see <a href="c.htm#cruft">cruft</a>).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="get_a_life!">Get a life!</a></h1><pre> imp.  Hacker-standard way of suggesting that the
   person to whom it is directed has succumbed to terminal geekdom
   (see <a href="c.htm#computer_geek">computer_geek</a>).  Often heard on <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a>, esp. as a
   way of suggesting that the target is taking some obscure issue of
   <a href="t.htm#theology">theology</a> too seriously.  This exhortation was popularized by
   William Shatner on a "Saturday Night Live" episode in a
   speech that ended "Get a *life*!", but some respondents
   believe it to have been in use before then.  It was certainly in
   wide use among hackers for at least five years before achieving
   mainstream currency in early 1992.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="get_a_real_computer!">Get a real computer!</a></h1><pre> imp.  Typical hacker response to news
   that somebody is having trouble getting work done on a system that
   (a) is single-tasking, (b) has no hard disk, or (c) has an address
   space smaller than 16 megabytes.  This is as of mid-1993; note that
   the threshold for `real computer' rises with time, and it may
   well be (for example) that machines with character-only displays
   will be generally considered `unreal' in a few years (GLS points
   out that they already are in some circles).  See <a href="b.htm#bitty_box">bitty_box</a> and
   <a href="t.htm#toy">toy</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gfr">GFR</a></h1><pre> /G-F-R/ vt.  [ITS: from `Grim File Reaper', an ITS and
   LISP Machine utility] To remove a file or files according to some
   program-automated or semi-automatic manual procedure, especially
   one designed to reclaim mass storage space or reduce name-space
   clutter (the original GFR actually moved files to tape).  Often
   generalized to pieces of data below file level.  "I used to have
   his phone number, but I guess I <a href="g.htm#gfr">GFR</a>ed it."  See also
   <a href="p.htm#prowler">prowler</a>, <a href="r.htm#reaper">reaper</a>.  Compare <a href="g.htm#gc">GC</a>, which discards only
   provably worthless stuff.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gig">gig</a></h1><pre> /jig/ or /gig/ n.  [SI] See <a href="q.htm#quantifiers">quantifiers</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="giga-">giga-</a></h1><pre> /ji'ga/ or /gi'ga/ pref.  [SI] See
   <a href="q.htm#quantifiers">quantifiers</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gigo">GIGO</a></h1><pre> /gi:'goh/ [acronym]  1. `Garbage In, Garbage Out' ---
   usually said in response to <a href="l.htm#luser">luser</a>s who complain that a program
   didn't "do the right thing" when given imperfect input or
   otherwise mistreated in some way.  Also commonly used to describe
   failures in human decision making due to faulty, incomplete, or
   imprecise data.  2. `Garbage In, Gospel Out': this more recent
   expansion is a sardonic comment on the tendency human beings have
   to put excessive trust in `computerized' data.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gilley">gilley</a></h1><pre> n.  [Usenet] The unit of analogical bogosity.
   According to its originator, the standard for one gilley was "the
   act of bogotoficiously comparing the shutting down of 1000 machines
   for a day with the killing of one person".  The milligilley has
   been found to suffice for most normal conversational exchanges.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gillion">gillion</a></h1><pre> /gil'y*n/ or /jil'y*n/ n.  [formed from
   <a href="g.htm#giga-">giga-</a> by analogy with mega/million and tera/trillion]
   10^9. Same as an American billion or a British `milliard'.
   How one pronounces this depends on whether one speaks <a href="g.htm#giga-">giga-</a>
   with a hard or soft `g'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="gips">GIPS</a></h1><pre> /gips/ or /jips/ n.  [analogy with <a href="m.htm#mips">MIPS</a>]
   Giga-Instructions per Second (also possibly `Gillions of
   Instructions per Second'; see <a href="g.htm#gillion">gillion</a>).  In 1991, this is used
   of only a handful of highly parallel machines, but this is expected
   to change.  Compare <a href="k.htm#kips">KIPS</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="glark">glark</a></h1><pre> /glark/ vt.  To figure something out from context.
   "The System III manuals are pretty poor, but you can generally
   glark the meaning from context."  Interestingly, the word was
   originally `glork'; the context was "This gubblick contains many
   nonsklarkish English flutzpahs, but the overall pluggandisp can be
   glorked [sic] from context" (David Moser, quoted by Douglas
   Hofstadter in his "Metamagical Themas" column in the January
   1981 "Scientific American").  It is conjectured that hackish
   usage mutated the verb to `glark' because <a href="g.htm#glork">glork</a> was already
   an established jargon term.  Compare <a href="g.htm#grok">grok</a>, <a href="z.htm#zen">zen</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="glass">glass</a></h1><pre> n.  [IBM] Synonym for <a href="s.htm#silicon">silicon</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="glass_tty">glass tty</a></h1><pre> /glas T-T-Y/ or /glas ti'tee/ n.  A terminal
   that has a display screen but which, because of hardware or
   software limitations, behaves like a teletype or some other
   printing terminal, thereby combining the disadvantages of both:
   like a printing terminal, it can't do fancy display hacks, and like
   a display terminal, it doesn't produce hard copy.  An example is
   the early `dumb' version of Lear-Siegler ADM 3 (without cursor
   control).  See <a href="t.htm#tube">tube</a>, <a href="t.htm#tty">tty</a>; compare <a href="d.htm#dumb_terminal">dumb_terminal</a>,
   <a href="s.htm#smart_terminal">smart_terminal</a>.  See "<a href="appa.htm#tv_typewriters">TV_Typewriters</a>" (Appendix
   A) for an interesting true story about a glass tty.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="glassfet">glassfet</a></h1><pre> /glas'fet/ n.  [by analogy with MOSFET, the
   acronym for `Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor']
   Syn.  <a href="f.htm#firebottle">firebottle</a>, a humorous way to refer to a vacuum tube.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="glitch">glitch</a></h1><pre> /glich/  [from German `glitzschig' to slip, via
   Yiddish `glitshen', to slide or skid] 1. n. A sudden interruption
   in electric service, sanity, continuity, or program function.
   Sometimes recoverable.  An interruption in electric service is
   specifically called a `power glitch' (also <a href="p.htm#power_hit">power_hit</a>), of
   grave concern because it usually crashes all the computers.  In
   jargon, though, a hacker who got to the middle of a sentence and
   then forgot how he or she intended to complete it might say,
   "Sorry, I just glitched".  2. vi. To commit a glitch.  See
   <a href="g.htm#gritch">gritch</a>.  3. vt.  [Stanford] To scroll a display screen, esp.
   several lines at a time.  <a href="w.htm#waits">WAITS</a> terminals used to do this in
   order to avoid continuous scrolling, which is distracting to the
   eye.  4. obs.  Same as <a href="m.htm#magic_cookie">magic_cookie</a>, sense 2.

   All these uses of `glitch' derive from the specific technical
   meaning the term has in the electronic hardware world, where it is
   now techspeak.  A glitch can occur when the inputs of a circuit
   change, and the outputs change to some <a href="r.htm#random">random</a> value for some
   very brief time before they settle down to the correct value.  If
   another circuit inspects the output at just the wrong time, reading
   the random value, the results can be very wrong and very hard to
   debug (a glitch is one of many causes of electronic <a href="h.htm#heisenbug">heisenbug</a>s).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="glob">glob</a></h1><pre> /glob/, *not* /glohb/ vt.,n.  [UNIX] To expand
   special characters in a wildcarded name, or the act of so doing
   (the action is also called `globbing').  The UNIX conventions for
   filename wildcarding have become sufficiently pervasive that many
   hackers use some of them in written English, especially in email or
   news on technical topics.  Those commonly encountered include the
   following:

     *
          wildcard for any string (see also <a href="u.htm#un*x">UN*X</a>)
  
     ?
          wildcard for any single character (generally read this way
          only at the beginning or in the middle of a word)

     []
          delimits a wildcard matching any of the enclosed characters

     {}
          alternation of comma-separated alternatives; thus,
          `foo{baz,qux}' would be read as `foobaz' or `fooqux'

   Some examples: "He said his name was [KC]arl" (expresses
   ambiguity).  "I don't read talk.politics.*" (any of the
   talk.politics subgroups on <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a>).  Other examples are given
   under the entry for <a href="x.htm#x">X</a>.  Note that glob patterns are similar,
   but not identical, to those used in <a href="r.htm#regexp">regexp</a>s.

   Historical note: The jargon usage derives from `glob', the
   name of a subprogram that expanded wildcards in archaic pre-Bourne
   versions of the UNIX shell.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="glork">glork</a></h1><pre> /glork/  1. interj. Term of mild surprise, usually
   tinged with outrage, as when one attempts to save the results of
   two hours of editing and finds that the system has just crashed.
   2. Used as a name for just about anything.  See <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a>.
   3. vt. Similar to <a href="g.htm#glitch">glitch</a>, but usually used reflexively.  "My
   program just glorked itself."  See also <a href="g.htm#glark">glark</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="glue">glue</a></h1><pre> n.  Generic term for any interface logic or protocol
   that connects two component blocks.  For example, <a href="b.htm#blue_glue">Blue_Glue</a> is
   IBM's SNA protocol, and hardware designers call anything used to

   UNIX!', see <a href="r.htm#recursive_acronym">recursive_acronym</a>] A UNIX-workalike development
   effort of the Free Software Foundation headed by Richard Stallman
   &ltrms@gnu.ai.mit.edu&gt.  GNU EMACS and the GNU C compiler, two
   tools designed for this project, have become very popular in
   hackerdom and elsewhere.  The GNU project was designed partly to
   proselytize for RMS's position that information is community
   property and all software source should be shared.  One of its
   slogans is "Help stamp out software hoarding!"  Though this
   remains controversial (because it implicitly denies any right of
   designers to own, assign, and sell the results of their labors),
   many hackers who disagree with RMS have nevertheless cooperated to
   produce large amounts of high-quality software for free
   redistribution under the Free Software Foundation's imprimatur.

   frob bearing reversed embossed images of 88 different characters
   arranged on four parallels of latitude; one could change the font
   by swapping in a different golf ball.  This was the technology that
   enabled APL to use a non-EBCDIC, non-ASCII, and in fact completely
   non-standard character set.  This put it 10 years ahead of its time
   -- where it stayed, firmly rooted, for the next 20, until
   character displays gave way to programmable bit-mapped devices with
   the flexibility to support other character sets.

<h1><a name="gopher">gopher</a></h1><pre> n.  A type of Internet service first floated around
   1991 and now (1994) being obsolesced by the World-Wide Web. Gopher
   presents a menuing interface to a tree or graph of links;
   the links can be to documents, runnable programs, or other gopher
   menus arbitrarily far across the net.

   Some claim that the gopher software, which was originally developed
   at the University of Minnesota, was named after the Minnesota
   Gophers (a sports team).  Others claim the word derives from
   American slang `gofer' (from "go for", dialectical "go fer"),
   one whose job is to run and fetch things.  Finally, observe that
   gophers (aka woodchucks) dig long tunnels, and the idea of
   tunneling through the net to find information was a defining
   metaphor for the developers.  Probably all three things were true,
   but with the first two coming first and the gopher-tunnel metaphor
   serendipitously adding flavor and impetus to the project as it
   developed out of its concept stage.

<h1><a name="gorilla_arm">gorilla arm</a></h1><pre> n.  The side-effect that destroyed touch-screens
   as a mainstream input technology despite a promising start in the
   early 1980s.  It seems the designers of all those <a href="s.htm#spiffy">spiffy</a>
   touch-menu systems failed to notice that humans aren't designed to
   hold their arms in front of their faces making small motions.
   After more than a very few selections, the arm begins to feel sore,
   cramped, and oversized -- the operator looks like a gorilla while
   using the touch screen and feels like one afterwards.  This is now
   considered a classic cautionary tale to human-factors designers;
   "Remember the gorilla arm!" is shorthand for "How is this going
   to fly in *real* use?".

<h1><a name="gotcha">gotcha</a></h1><pre> n.  A <a href="m.htm#misfeature">misfeature</a> of a system, especially a

   mistakes because it both enticingly easy to invoke and completely
   unexpected and/or unreasonable in its outcome.  For example, a
   classic gotcha in <a href="c.htm#c">C</a> is the fact that `if (a=b) {code;}'
   is syntactically valid and sometimes even correct.  It puts the
   value of `b' into `a' and then executes `code' if
   `a' is non-zero.  What the programmer probably meant was
   `if (a==b) {code;}', which executes `code' if `a'

   Decades ago, back in the days when it was the sole supplier of
   long-distance hardcopy transmittal devices, the Teletype
   Corporation was faced with a major design choice.  To shorten code
   lengths and cut complexity in the printing mechanism, it had been
   decided that teletypes would use a monocase font, either ALL UPPER
   or all lower.  The Question Of The Day was therefore, which one to
   choose.  A study was conducted on readability under various
   conditions of bad ribbon, worn print hammers, etc.  Lowercase won;
   it is less dense and has more distinctive letterforms, and is thus
   much easier to read both under ideal conditions and when the
   letters are mangled or partly obscured.  The results were filtered
   up through <a href="m.htm#management">management</a>.  The chairman of Teletype killed the
   proposal because it failed one incredibly important criterion:

        "It would be impossible to spell the name of the Deity
        correctly."

   In this way (or so, at least, hacker folklore has it) superstition
   triumphed over utility.  Teletypes were the major input devices on
   most early computers, and terminal manufacturers looking for
   corners to cut naturally followed suit until well into the 1970s.
   Thus, that one bad call stuck us with Great Runes for thirty years.

<h1><a name="green_bytes">green bytes</a></h1><pre> n.  (also `green words') 1. Meta-information
   embedded in a file, such as the length of the file or its name; as
   opposed to keeping such information in a separate description file

<h1><a name="grind_crank">grind crank</a></h1><pre> n.   A mythical accessory to a terminal.  A
   crank on the side of a monitor, which when operated makes a zizzing
   noise and causes the computer to run faster.  Usually one does not
   refer to a grind crank out loud, but merely makes the appropriate
   gesture and noise.  See <a href="g.htm#grind">grind</a> and <a href="w.htm#wugga_wugga">wugga_wugga</a>.

   Historical note: At least one real machine actually had a grind
   crank -- the R1, a research machine built toward the end of the
   days of the great vacuum tube computers, in 1959.  R1 (also known
   as `The Rice Institute Computer' (TRIC) and later as `The Rice
   University Computer' (TRUC)) had a single-step/free-run switch for
   use when debugging programs.  Since single-stepping through a large
   program was rather tedious, there was also a crank with a cam and
   gear arrangement that repeatedly pushed the single-step button.
   This allowed one to `crank' through a lot of code, then slow
   down to single-step for a bit when you got near the code of
   interest, poke at some registers using the console typewriter, and
   then keep on cranking.

   <a href="g.htm#glitch">glitch</a>).  2. vi. To complain.  Often verb-doubled: "Gritch
   gritch".  3. A synonym for <a href="g.htm#glitch">glitch</a> (as verb or noun).

   Interestingly, this word seems to have a separate history from
   <a href="g.htm#glitch">glitch</a>, with which it is often confused.  Back in the early
   1960s, when `glitch' was strictly a hardware-tech's term of art,
   the Burton House dorm at M.I.T. maintained a "Gritch Book", a
   blank volume, into which the residents hand-wrote complaints,
   suggestions, and witticisms.  Previous years' volumes of this
   tradition were maintained, dating back to antiquity.  The word
   "gritch" was described as a portmanteau of "gripe" and
   "bitch".  Thus, sense 3 above is at least historically incorrect.

<h1><a name="grok">grok</a></h1><pre> /grok/, var. /grohk/ vt.  [from the novel
   "Stranger in a Strange Land", by Robert A. Heinlein, where it
   is a Martian word meaning literally `to drink' and metaphorically
   `to be one with'] The emphatic form is `grok in
   fullness'. 1. To understand, usually in a global sense.  Connotes
   intimate and exhaustive knowledge.  Contrast <a href="z.htm#zen">zen</a>, which is
   similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief flash.
   See also <a href="g.htm#glark">glark</a>.  2. Used of programs, may connote merely
   sufficient understanding.  "Almost all C compilers grok the
   `void' type these days."

<h1><a name="gronk">gronk</a></h1><pre> /gronk/ vt.  [popularized by Johnny Hart's comic

   <a href="c.htm#crunch">crunch</a>.  Emphatic form: `grovel obscenely'.  2. To examine
   minutely or in complete detail.  "The compiler grovels over the

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="guru_meditation">guru meditation</a></h1><pre> n.  Amiga equivalent of `panic' in UNIX
   (sometimes just called a `guru' or `guru event').  When the
   system crashes, a cryptic message of the form "GURU MEDITATION
   #XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY" may appear, indicating what the problem was.
   An Amiga guru can figure things out from the numbers.  Generally a
   <a href="g.htm#guru">guru</a> event must be followed by a <a href="v.htm#vulcan_nerve_pinch">Vulcan_nerve_pinch</a>.

   This term is (no surprise) an in-joke from the earliest days of the
   Amiga.  There used to be a device called a `Joyboard' which was
   basically a plastic board built onto a joystick-like device; it was
   sold with a skiing game cartridge for the Atari game machine.  It
   is said that whenever the prototype OS crashed, the system
   programmer responsible would calm down by concentrating on a
   solution while sitting cross-legged on a Joyboard trying to keep
   the board in balance.  This position resembled that of a meditating
   guru.  Sadly, the joke was removed in AmigaOS 2.04 (actually in
   2.00, a buggy post-2.0 release on the A3000 only).

   the College Computing Center punching cards or crashing the

   of those technologies, however, and is still alive in late 1991.
   "I'm going to go gweep for a while.  See you in the morning." "I
   gweep from 8 PM till 3 AM during the week."  2. n. One who
   habitually gweeps in sense 1; a <a href="h.htm#hacker">hacker</a>.  "He's a hard-core
