<h1><a name="i_didn't_change_anything!">I didn't change anything!</a></h1><pre> interj.  An aggrieved cry often
   heard as bugs manifest during a regression test.  The
   <a href="c.htm#canonical">canonical</a> reply to this assertion is "Then it works just the
   same as it did before, doesn't it?"  See also <a href="o.htm#one-line_fix">one-line_fix</a>.
   This is also heard from applications programmers trying to blame an
   obvious applications problem on an unrelated systems software
   change, for example a divide-by-0 fault after terminals were added
   to a network.  Usually, their statement is found to be false.  Upon
   close questioning, they will admit some major restructuring of the
   program that shouldn't have broken anything, in their opinion, but
   which actually <a href="h.htm#hosed">hosed</a> the code completely.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="i_see_no_x_here.">I see no X here.</a></h1><pre>  Hackers (and the interactive computer
   games they write) traditionally favor this slightly marked usage
   over other possible equivalents such as "There's no X here!" or
   "X is missing."  or "Where's the X?".  This goes back to the
   original PDP-10 <a href="a.htm#advent">ADVENT</a>, which would respond in this wise if
   you asked it to do something involving an object not present at
   your location in the game.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ibm">IBM</a></h1><pre> /I-B-M/  Inferior But Marketable; It's Better
   Manually; Insidious Black Magic; It's Been Malfunctioning;
   Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a near-<a href="i.htm#infinite">infinite</a> number of even
   less complimentary expansions, including `International Business
   Machines'.  See <a href="t.htm#tla">TLA</a>.  These abbreviations illustrate the
   considerable antipathy most hackers have long felt toward the
   `industry leader' (see <a href="f.htm#fear_and_loathing">fear_and_loathing</a>).

   What galls hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level isn't
   so much that they are underpowered and overpriced (though that does
   count against them), but that the designs are incredibly archaic,
   <a href="c.htm#crufty">crufty</a>, and <a href="e.htm#elephantine">elephantine</a> ... and you can't *fix* them
   -- source code is locked up tight, and programming tools are
   expensive, hard to find, and bletcherous to use once you've found
   them.  With the release of the UNIX-based RIOS family this may have
   begun to change -- but then, we thought that when the PC-RT came
   out, too.

   In the spirit of universal peace and brotherhood, this lexicon now
   includes a number of entries attributed to `IBM'; these derive from
   some rampantly unofficial jargon lists circulated within IBM's own
   beleaguered hacker underground.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ibm_discount">IBM discount</a></h1><pre> n.  A price increase.  Outside IBM, this
   derives from the common perception that IBM products are generally
   overpriced (see <a href="c.htm#clone">clone</a>); inside, it is said to spring from a
   belief that large numbers of IBM employees living in an area cause
   prices to rise.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="icbm_address">ICBM address</a></h1><pre> n.  (Also `missile address') The form used to
   register a site with the Usenet mapping project includes a blank
   for longitude and latitude, preferably to seconds-of-arc accuracy.
   This is actually used for generating geographically-correct maps of
   Usenet links on a plotter; however, it has become traditional to
   refer to this as one's `ICBM address' or `missile address', and
   many people include it in their <a href="s.htm#sig_block">sig_block</a> with that name.  (A
   real missile address would include target altitude.)

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ice">ice</a></h1><pre> n.  [coined by Usenetter Tom Maddox, popularized by
   William Gibson's cyberpunk SF novels: a contrived acronym for
   `Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics'] Security software (in
   Gibson's novels, software that responds to intrusion by attempting
   to literally kill the intruder).  Also, `icebreaker': a program
   designed for cracking security on a system.

   Neither term is in serious use yet as of mid-1993, but many hackers
   find the metaphor attractive, and each may develop a denotation in
   the future. In the meantime, the speculative usage could be
   confused with `ICE', an acronym for "in-circuit emulator".

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="idempotent">idempotent</a></h1><pre> adj.  [from mathematical techspeak] Acting as if
   used only once, even if used multiple times.  This term is often
   used with respect to <a href="c.htm#c">C</a> header files, which contain common
   definitions and declarations to be included by several source
   files.  If a header file is ever included twice during the same
   compilation (perhaps due to nested #include files), compilation
   errors can result unless the header file has protected itself
   against multiple inclusion; a header file so protected is said to
   be idempotent.  The term can also be used to describe an
   initialization subroutine that is arranged to perform some critical
   action exactly once, even if the routine is called several times.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="if_you_want_x,_you_know_where_to_find_it.">If you want X, you know where to find it.</a></h1><pre>  There is a legend
   that Dennis Ritchie, inventor of <a href="c.htm#c">C</a>, once responded to demands
   for features resembling those of what at the time was a much more
   popular language by observing "If you want PL/I, you know where to
   find it."  Ever since, this has been hackish standard form for
   fending off requests to alter a new design to mimic some older
   (and, by implication, inferior and <a href="b.htm#baroque">baroque</a>) one.  The case X =
   <a href="p.htm#pascal">Pascal</a> manifests semi-regularly on Usenet's comp.lang.c
   newsgroup.  Indeed, the case X = X has been reported in discussions
   of graphics software (see <a href="x.htm#x">X</a>).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ifdef_out">ifdef out</a></h1><pre> /if'def owt/ v.  Syn. for <a href="c.htm#condition_out">condition_out</a>,
   specific to <a href="c.htm#c">C</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ill-behaved">ill-behaved</a></h1><pre> adj.  1. [numerical analysis] Said of an
   algorithm or computational method that tends to blow up because of
   accumulated roundoff error or poor convergence properties.
   2. Software that bypasses the defined <a href="o.htm#os">OS</a> interfaces to do
   things (like screen, keyboard, and disk I/O) itself, often in a way
   that depends on the hardware of the machine it is running on or
   which is nonportable or incompatible with other pieces of software.
   In the IBM PC/MS-DOS world, there is a folk theorem (nearly true)
   to the effect that (owing to gross inadequacies and performance
   penalties in the OS interface) all interesting applications are
   ill-behaved.  See also <a href="b.htm#bare_metal">bare_metal</a>. Oppose <a href="w.htm#well-behaved">well-behaved</a>,
   compare <a href="p.htm#pc-ism">PC-ism</a>.  See <a href="m.htm#mess-dos">mess-dos</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="imho">IMHO</a></h1><pre> // abbrev.  [from SF fandom via Usenet; abbreviation for
   `In My Humble Opinion'] "IMHO, mixed-case C names should be
   avoided, as mistyping something in the wrong case can cause
   hard-to-detect errors -- and they look too Pascalish anyhow."
   Also seen in variant forms such as IMNSHO (In My Not-So-Humble
   Opinion) and IMAO (In My Arrogant Opinion).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="imminent_death_of_the_net_predicted!">Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!</a></h1><pre> prov.  [Usenet] Since
   <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> first got off the ground in 1980--81, it has grown
   exponentially, approximately doubling in size every year.  On the
   other hand, most people feel the <a href="s.htm#signal-to-noise_ratio">signal-to-noise_ratio</a> of
   Usenet has dropped steadily.  These trends led, as far back as
   mid-1983, to predictions of the imminent collapse (or death) of the
   net.  Ten years and numerous doublings later, enough of these
   gloomy prognostications have been confounded that the phrase
   "Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!" has become a running joke,
   hauled out any time someone grumbles about the <a href="s.htm#s/n_ratio">S/N_ratio</a> or
   the huge and steadily increasing volume, or the possible loss of a
   key node or link, or the potential for lawsuits when ignoramuses
   post copyrighted material, etc., etc., etc.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="in_the_extreme">in the extreme</a></h1><pre> adj.  A preferred superlative suffix for many
   hackish terms.  See, for example, `obscure in the extreme' under
   <a href="o.htm#obscure">obscure</a>, and compare <a href="h.htm#highly">highly</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="inc">inc</a></h1><pre> /ink/ v.  Verbal (and only rarely written) shorthand
   for increment, i.e. `increase by one'.  Especially used by
   assembly programmers, as many assembly languages have an `inc'
   mnemonic.  Antonym: <a href="d.htm#dec">dec</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="incantation">incantation</a></h1><pre> n.  Any particularly arbitrary or obscure
   command that one must mutter at a system to attain a desired
   result.  Not used of passwords or other explicit security features.
   Especially used of tricks that are so poorly documented that they
   must be learned from a <a href="w.htm#wizard">wizard</a>.  "This compiler normally
   locates initialized data in the data segment, but if you
   <a href="m.htm#mutter">mutter</a> the right incantation they will be forced into text
   space."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="include">include</a></h1><pre> vt.  [Usenet] 1. To duplicate a portion (or whole)
   of another's message (typically with attribution to the source) in
   a reply or followup, for clarifying the context of one's response.
   See the discussion of inclusion styles under "Hacker Writing
   Style".  2. [from <a href="c.htm#c">C</a>] `#include &ltdisclaimer.h&gt' has
   appeared in <a href="s.htm#sig_block">sig_block</a>s to refer to a notional `standard
   <a href="d.htm#disclaimer">disclaimer</a> file'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="include_war">include war</a></h1><pre> n.  Excessive multi-leveled including within a
   discussion <a href="t.htm#thread">thread</a>, a practice that tends to annoy readers.  In
   a forum with high-traffic newsgroups, such as Usenet, this can lead
   to <a href="f.htm#flame">flame</a>s and the urge to start a <a href="k.htm#kill_file">kill_file</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="indent_style">indent style</a></h1><pre> n.  [C programmers] The rules one uses to
   indent code in a readable fashion.  There are four major C indent
   styles, described below; all have the aim of making it easier for
   the reader to visually track the scope of control constructs.  The
   significant variable is the placement of `{'_and_`}'
   with respect to the statement(s) they enclose and to the guard or
   controlling statement (`if', `else', `for',
   `while', or `do') on the block, if any.

   `K&R style' -- Named after Kernighan & Ritchie, because the
   examples in <a href="k.htm#k&r">K&R</a> are formatted this way.  Also called `kernel
   style' because the UNIX kernel is written in it, and the `One True
   Brace Style' (abbrev. 1TBS) by its partisans.  The basic indent
   shown here is eight spaces (or one tab) per level; four spaces are
   occasionally seen, but are much less common.

     if (cond) {
             &ltbody&gt
     }

   `Allman style' -- Named for Eric Allman, a Berkeley hacker who
   wrote a lot of the BSD utilities in it (it is sometimes called
   `BSD style').  Resembles normal indent style in Pascal and
   Algol.  Basic indent per level shown here is eight spaces, but four
   spaces are just as common (esp. in C++ code).

     if (cond)
     {
             &ltbody&gt
     }

   `Whitesmiths style' -- popularized by the examples that came
   with Whitesmiths C, an early commercial C compiler.  Basic indent
   per level shown here is eight spaces, but four spaces are
   occasionally seen.

     if (cond)
             {
             &ltbody&gt
             }

   `GNU style' -- Used throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software
   Foundation code, and just about nowhere else.  Indents are always
   four spaces per level, with `{'_and_`}' halfway between the
   outer and inner indent levels.

     if (cond)
       {
         &ltbody&gt
       }

   Surveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most
   common, with about equal mind shares.  K&R/1TBS used to be nearly
   universal, but is now much less common (the opening brace tends to
   get lost against the right paren of the guard part in an `if'
   or `while', which is a <a href="b.htm#bad_thing">Bad_Thing</a>).  Defenders of 1TBS
   argue that any putative gain in readability is less important than
   their style's relative economy with vertical space, which enables
   one to see more code on one's screen at once.  Doubtless these
   issues will continue to be the subject of <a href="h.htm#holy_wars">holy_wars</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="index">index</a></h1><pre> n.  See <a href="c.htm#coefficient_of_x">coefficient_of_X</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="infant_mortality">infant mortality</a></h1><pre> n.  It is common lore among hackers (and in
   the electronics industry at large; this term is possibly techspeak
   by now) that the chances of sudden hardware failure drop off
   exponentially with a machine's time since first use (that is, until
   the relatively distant time at which enough mechanical wear in I/O
   devices and thermal-cycling stress in components has accumulated
   for the machine to start going senile).  Up to half of all chip and
   wire failures happen within a new system's first few weeks; such
   failures are often referred to as `infant mortality' problems
   (or, occasionally, as `sudden infant death syndrome').  See
   <a href="b.htm#bathtub_curve">bathtub_curve</a>, <a href="b.htm#burn-in_period">burn-in_period</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="infinite">infinite</a></h1><pre> adj.  Consisting of a large number of objects;
   extreme.  Used very loosely as in: "This program produces infinite
   garbage."  "He is an infinite loser."  The word most likely to
   follow `infinite', though, is <a href="h.htm#hair">hair</a>.  (It has been pointed
   out that fractals are an excellent example of infinite hair.)
   These uses are abuses of the word's mathematical meaning.  The term
   `semi-infinite', denoting an immoderately large amount of some
   resource, is also heard.  "This compiler is taking a semi-infinite
   amount of time to optimize my program."  See also <a href="s.htm#semi">semi</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="infinite_loop">infinite loop</a></h1><pre> n.  One that never terminates (that is, the
   machine <a href="s.htm#spin">spin</a>s or <a href="b.htm#buzz">buzz</a>es forever and goes <a href="c.htm#catatonic">catatonic</a>).
   There is a standard joke that has been made about each generation's
   exemplar of the ultra-fast machine: "The Cray-3 is so fast it can
   execute an infinite loop in under 2 seconds!"

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="infinite-monkey_theorem">Infinite-Monkey Theorem</a></h1><pre> n.  "If you put an <a href="i.htm#infinite">infinite</a>
   number of monkeys at typewriters, eventually one will bash out the
   script for Hamlet."  (One may also hypothesize a small number of
   monkeys and a very long period of time.)  This theorem asserts
   nothing about the intelligence of the one <a href="r.htm#random">random</a> monkey that
   eventually comes up with the script (and note that the mob will
   also type out all the possible *incorrect* versions of
   Hamlet).  It may be referred to semi-seriously when justifying a
   <a href="b.htm#brute_force">brute_force</a> method; the implication is that, with enough
   resources thrown at it, any technical challenge becomes a
   <a href="o.htm#one-banana_problem">one-banana_problem</a>.

   This theorem was first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur
   Eddington.  It became part of the idiom of through the classic
   short story "Inflexible Logic" by Russell Maloney, and many
   younger hackers know it through a reference in Douglas Adams's
   "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="infinity">infinity</a></h1><pre> n.  1. The largest value that can be represented in
   a particular type of variable (register, memory location, data
   type, whatever).  2. `minus infinity': The smallest such value,
   not necessarily or even usually the simple negation of plus
   infinity.  In N-bit twos-complement arithmetic, infinity is
   2^(N-1) - 1 but minus infinity is -
   (2^(N-1)), not -(2^(N-1) - 1).  Note also that this
   is different from "time T equals minus infinity", which is
   closer to a mathematician's usage of infinity.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="infocom">Infocom</a></h1><pre> n.  A now-legendary games company, active from 1979 to
   1989, that commercialized the MDL parser technology used for
   <a href="z.htm#zork">Zork</a> to produce a line of text adventure games that remain
   favorites among hackers.  Infocom's games were intelligent, funny,
   witty, erudite, irreverent, challenging, satirical, and most
   thoroughly hackish in spirit.  The physical game packages from
   Infocom are now prized collector's items.  The software,
   thankfully, is still extant; Infocom games were written in a kind
   of P-code and distributed with a P-code interpreter core, and
   freeware emulators for that interpreter have been written to permit
   the P-code to be run on platforms the games never originally
   graced.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="initgame">initgame</a></h1><pre> /in-it'gaym/ n.  [IRC] An <a href="i.htm#irc">IRC</a> version of the
   venerable trivia game "20 questions", in which one user changes
   his <a href="n.htm#nick">nick</a> to the initials of a famous person or other named
   entity, and the others on the channel ask yes or no questions, with
   the one to guess the person getting to be "it" next.  As a
   courtesy, the one picking the initials starts by providing a
   4-letter hint of the form sex, nationality, life-status,
   reality-status.  For example, MAAR means "Male, American, Alive,
   Real" (as opposed to "fictional").  Initgame can be surprisingly
   addictive.  See also <a href="h.htm#hing">hing</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="insanely_great">insanely great</a></h1><pre> adj.  [Mac community, from Steve Jobs; also
   BSD UNIX people via Bill Joy] Something so incredibly <a href="e.htm#elegant">elegant</a>
   that it is imaginable only to someone possessing the most puissant
   of <a href="h.htm#hacker">hacker</a>-natures.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="intercal">INTERCAL</a></h1><pre> /in't*r-kal/ n.  [said by the authors to stand
   for `Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym'] A computer
   language designed by Don Woods and James Lyons in 1972.  INTERCAL
   is purposely different from all other computer languages in all
   ways but one; it is purely a written language, being totally
   unspeakable.  An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference Manual will
   make the style of the language clear:

     It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose
     work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem.  For example, if
     one were to state that the simplest way to store a value of 65536
     in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is:

          DO :1 &lt- #0$#256

     any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd.  Since
     this is indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made
     to look foolish in front of his boss, who would of course have
     happened to turn up, as bosses are wont to do.  The effect would
     be no less devastating for the programmer having been correct.

   INTERCAL has many other peculiar features designed to make it even
   more unspeakable.  The Woods-Lyons implementation was actually used
   by many (well, at least several) people at Princeton.  The language
   has been recently reimplemented as C-INTERCAL and is consequently
   enjoying an unprecedented level of unpopularity; there is even an
   alt.lang.intercal newsgroup devoted to the study and ...
   appreciation of the language on Usenet.


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="interesting">interesting</a></h1><pre> adj.  In hacker parlance, this word has strong
   connotations of `annoying', or `difficult', or both.  Hackers
   relish a challenge, and enjoy wringing all the irony possible out
   of the ancient Chinese curse "May you live in interesting times".
   Oppose <a href="t.htm#trivial">trivial</a>, <a href="u.htm#uninteresting">uninteresting</a>.

<h1><a name="internet_address">Internet address</a></h1><pre>: n.  1. [techspeak] An absolute network
   address of the form foo@bar.baz, where foo is a user name, bar
   is a <a href="s.htm#sitename">sitename</a>, and baz is a `domain' name, possibly
   including periods itself.  Contrast with <a href="b.htm#bang_path">bang_path</a>; see also
   <a href="n.htm#network,_the">network,_the</a> and <a href="n.htm#network_address">network_address</a>.  All Internet machines
   and most UUCP sites can now resolve these addresses, thanks to a
   large amount of behind-the-scenes magic and PD software written
   since 1980 or so.  See also <a href="b.htm#bang_path">bang_path</a>, <a href="d.htm#domainist">domainist</a>.
   2. More loosely, any network address reachable through Internet;
   this includes <a href="b.htm#bang_path">bang_path</a> addresses and some internal corporate
   and government networks.

   Reading Internet addresses is something of an art.  Here are the
   four most important top-level functional Internet domains followed
   by a selection of geographical domains:

     com
          commercial organizations
     edu
          educational institutions
     gov
          U.S. government civilian sites
     mil
          U.S. military sites

   Note that most of the sites in the com and edu domains are in
   the U.S. or Canada.

     us
          sites in the U.S. outside the functional domains
     su
          sites in the ex-Soviet Union (see <a href="k.htm#kremvax">kremvax</a>).
     uk
          sites in the United Kingdom

   Within the us domain, there are subdomains for the fifty
   states, each generally with a name identical to the state's postal
   abbreviation.  Within the uk domain, there is an ac subdomain for
   academic sites and a co domain for commercial ones.  Other
   top-level domains may be divided up in similar ways.

<h1><a name="interrupt">interrupt</a></h1><pre>  1. [techspeak] n. On a computer, an event that
   interrupts normal processing and temporarily diverts
   flow-of-control through an "interrupt handler" routine.  See also
   <a href="t.htm#trap">trap</a>.  2. interj. A request for attention from a hacker.
   Often explicitly spoken.  "Interrupt -- have you seen Joe
   recently?"  See <a href="p.htm#priority_interrupt">priority_interrupt</a>.  3. Under MS-DOS, nearly
   synonymous with `system call', because the OS and BIOS routines
   are both called using the INT instruction (see <a href="i.htm#interrupt_list,_the">interrupt_list,_the</a>
   ) and because programmers so often have to bypass the OS
(going
   directly to a BIOS interrupt) to get reasonable
   performance.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="interrupt_list,_the">interrupt list, the</a></h1><pre>: n.  [MS-DOS] The list of all known
   software interrupt calls (both documented and undocumented) for IBM
   PCs and compatibles, maintained and made available for free
   redistribution by Ralf Brown &ltralf@cs.cmu.edu&gt.  As of late
   1992, it had grown to approximately two megabytes in length.

<h1><a name="interrupts_locked_out">interrupts locked out</a></h1><pre> adj.  When someone is ignoring you.
   In a restaurant, after several fruitless attempts to get the
   waitress's attention, a hacker might well observe "She must have
   interrupts locked out".  The synonym `interrupts disabled' is
   also common.  Variations abound; "to have one's interrupt mask bit
   set" and "interrupts masked out" are also heard.  See also

<h1><a name="irc">IRC</a></h1><pre> /I-R-C/ n.  [Internet Relay Chat] A worldwide "party
   line" network that allows one to converse with others in real
   time.  IRC is structured as a network of Internet servers, each of
   which accepts connections from client programs, one per user.  The
   IRC community and the <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> and <a href="m.htm#mud">MUD</a> communities overlap
   to some extent, including both hackers and regular folks who have
   discovered the wonders of computer networks.  Some Usenet jargon
   has been adopted on IRC, as have some conventions such as
   <a href="e.htm#emoticon">emoticon</a>s.  There is also a vigorous native jargon,
   represented in this lexicon by entries marked `[IRC]'.  See also

<h1><a name="iron_age">Iron Age</a></h1><pre> n.  In the history of computing, 1961--1971 -- the
   formative era of commercial <a href="m.htm#mainframe">mainframe</a> technology, when
   ferrite-core <a href="d.htm#dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s ruled the earth.  The Iron Age began,
   ironically enough, with the delivery of the first minicomputer (the
   PDP-1) and ended with the introduction of the first commercial
   microprocessor (the Intel 4004) in 1971.  See also <a href="s.htm#stone_age">Stone_Age</a>;

<h1><a name="its">ITS</a></h1><pre>: /I-T-S/ n.  1. Incompatible Time-sharing System, an
   influential but highly idiosyncratic operating system written for
   PDP-6s and PDP-10s at MIT and long used at the MIT AI Lab.  Much
   AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS folklore, and to have been `an
   ITS hacker' qualifies one instantly as an old-timer of the most
   venerable sort.  ITS pioneered many important innovations,
   including transparent file sharing between machines and
   terminal-independent I/O.  After about 1982, most actual work was
   shifted to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run
   essentially as a hobby and service to the hacker community.  The
   shutdown of the lab's last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end
   of an era and sent old-time hackers into mourning nationwide (see
   <a href="h.htm#high_moby">high_moby</a>).  The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden is
   maintaining one `live' ITS site at its computer museum (right
   next to the only TOPS-10 system still on the Internet), so ITS is
   still alleged to hold the record for OS in longest continuous use
   (however, <a href="w.htm#waits">WAITS</a> is a credible rival for this palm).  2. A
   mythical image of operating-system perfection worshiped by a
   bizarre, fervent retro-cult of old-time hackers and ex-users (see
   <a href="t.htm#troglodyte">troglodyte</a>, sense 2).  ITS worshipers manage somehow to
   continue believing that an OS maintained by assembly-language
   hand-hacking that supported only monocase 6-character filenames in
   one directory per account remains superior to today's state of
   commercial art (their venom against UNIX is particularly intense).
