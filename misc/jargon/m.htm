<h1><a name="macro">macro</a></h1><pre> /mak'roh/ [techspeak] n.  A name (possibly followed
   by a formal <a href="a.htm#arg">arg</a> list) that is equated to a text or symbolic
   expression to which it is to be expanded (possibly with the
   substitution of actual arguments) by a macro expander.  This
   definition can be found in any technical dictionary; what those
   won't tell you is how the hackish connotations of the term have
   changed over time.

   The term `macro' originated in early assemblers, which encouraged
   the use of macros as a structuring and information-hiding device.
   During the early 1970s, macro assemblers became ubiquitous, and
   sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as <a href="h.htm#hll">HLL</a>s, only to fall
   from favor as improving compiler technology marginalized assembler
   programming (see <a href="l.htm#languages_of_choice">languages_of_choice</a>).  Nowadays the term is
   most often used in connection with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one
   of several special-purpose languages built around a macro-expansion
   facility (such as TeX or UNIX's [nt]roff suite).

   Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective
   `macros' is now sometimes used for code in any special-purpose
   application control language (whether or not the language is
   actually translated by text expansion), and for macro-like entities
   such as the `keyboard macros' supported in some text editors
   (and PC TSR or Macintosh INIT/CDEV keyboard enhancers).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="macro-">macro-</a></h1><pre> pref.  Large.  Opposite of <a href="m.htm#micro-">micro-</a>.  In the
   mainstream and among other technical cultures (for example, medical
   people) this competes with the prefix <a href="m.htm#mega-">mega-</a>, but hackers tend
   to restrict the latter to quantification.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="macrology">macrology</a></h1><pre> /mak-rol'*-jee/ n.  1. Set of usually complex or
   crufty macros, e.g., as part of a large system written in
   <a href="l.htm#lisp">LISP</a>, <a href="t.htm#teco">TECO</a>, or (less commonly) assembler.  2. The art and
   science involved in comprehending a macrology in sense 1.
   Sometimes studying the macrology of a system is not unlike
   archeology, ecology, or <a href="t.htm#theology">theology</a>, hence the sound-alike
   construction.  See also <a href="b.htm#boxology">boxology</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="macrotape">macrotape</a></h1><pre> /mak'roh-tayp/ n.  An industry-standard reel of
   tape, as opposed to a <a href="m.htm#microtape">microtape</a>. See also <a href="r.htm#round_tape">round_tape</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="maggotbox">maggotbox</a></h1><pre> /mag'*t-boks/ n.  See <a href="m.htm#macintrash">Macintrash</a>.  This is
   even more derogatory.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="magic">magic</a></h1><pre> adj.  1. As yet unexplained, or too complicated to
   explain; compare <a href="a.htm#automagically">automagically</a> and (Arthur C.) Clarke's Third
   Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
   from magic."  "TTY echoing is controlled by a large number of
   magic bits."  "This routine magically computes the parity of an
   8-bit byte in three instructions."  2. Characteristic of something
   that works although no one really understands why (this is
   especially called <a href="b.htm#black_magic">black_magic</a>).  3. [Stanford] A feature not
   generally publicized that allows something otherwise impossible, or
   a feature formerly in that category but now unveiled.  Compare
   <a href="b.htm#black_magic">black_magic</a>, <a href="w.htm#wizardly">wizardly</a>, <a href="d.htm#deep_magic">deep_magic</a>, <a href="h.htm#heavy_wizardry">heavy_wizardry</a>

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="magic_cookie">magic cookie</a></h1><pre> n.  [UNIX] 1. Something passed between routines
   or programs that enables the receiver to perform some operation; a
   capability ticket or opaque identifier.  Especially used of small
   data objects that contain data encoded in a strange or
   intrinsically machine-dependent way.  E.g., on non-UNIX OSes with a
   non-byte-stream model of files, the result of `ftell(3)' may
   be a magic cookie rather than a byte offset; it can be passed to
   `fseek(3)', but not operated on in any meaningful way.  The
   phrase `it hands you a magic cookie' means it returns a result
   whose contents are not defined but which can be passed back to the
   same or some other program later.  2. An in-band code for changing
   graphic rendition (e.g., inverse video or underlining) or
   performing other control functions (see also <a href="c.htm#cookie">cookie</a>).  Some
   older terminals would leave a blank on the screen corresponding to
   mode-change magic cookies; this was also called a <a href="g.htm#glitch">glitch</a> (or
   occasionally a `turd'; compare <a href="m.htm#mouse_droppings">mouse_droppings</a>).  See also
   <a href="c.htm#cookie">cookie</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="magic_number">magic number</a></h1><pre> n.  [UNIX/C] 1. In source code, some
   non-obvious constant whose value is significant to the operation of
   a program and that is inserted inconspicuously in-line
   (<a href="h.htm#hardcoded">hardcoded</a>), rather than expanded in by a symbol set by a
   commented `#define'.  Magic numbers in this sense are bad
   style.  2. A number that encodes critical information used in an
   algorithm in some opaque way.  The classic examples of these are
   the numbers used in hash or CRC functions, or the coefficients in a
   linear congruential generator for pseudo-random numbers.  This
   sense actually predates and was ancestral to the more common sense
   1.  3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file
   to indicate its type to a utility.  Under UNIX, the system and
   various applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish
   between types of executable file by looking for a magic number.
   Once upon a time, these magic numbers were PDP-11 branch
   instructions that skipped over header data to the start of
   executable code; 0407, for example, was octal for `branch 16 bytes
   relative'.  Nowadays only a <a href="w.htm#wizard">wizard</a> knows the spells to create
   magic numbers.  How do you choose a fresh magic number of your own?
   Simple -- you pick one at random.  See?  It's magic!

   *The* magic number, on the other hand, is 7+/-2.  See
   "The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on
   our capacity for processing information" by George Miller, in the
   "Psychological Review" 63:81-97 (1956).  This classic paper
   established the number of distinct items (such as numeric digits)
   that humans can hold in short-term memory.  Among other things,
   this strongly influenced the interface design of the phone system.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="magic_smoke">magic smoke</a></h1><pre> n.  A substance trapped inside IC packages that
   enables them to function (also called `blue smoke'; this is
   similar to the archaic `phlogiston' hypothesis about
   combustion).  Its existence is demonstrated by what happens when a
   chip burns up -- the magic smoke gets let out, so it doesn't work
   any more.  See <a href="s.htm#smoke_test">smoke_test</a>, <a href="l.htm#let_the_smoke_out">let_the_smoke_out</a>.

   Usenetter Jay Maynard tells the following story: "Once, while
   hacking on a dedicated Z80 system, I was testing code by blowing
   EPROMs and plugging them in the system, then seeing what happened.
   One time, I plugged one in backwards.  I only discovered that
   *after* I realized that Intel didn't put power-on lights under
   the quartz windows on the tops of their EPROMs -- the die was
   glowing white-hot.  Amazingly, the EPROM worked fine after I erased
   it, filled it full of zeros, then erased it again.  For all I know,
   it's still in service.  Of course, this is because the magic smoke
   didn't get let out."  Compare the original phrasing of <a href="m.htm#murphy's_law">Murphy's_Law</a>
   .

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mail_storm">mail storm</a></h1><pre> n.  [from <a href="b.htm#broadcast_storm">broadcast_storm</a>, influenced by
   `maelstrom'] What often happens when a machine with an Internet
   connection and active users re-connects after extended downtime ---
   a flood of incoming mail that brings the machine to its knees.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mailbomb">mailbomb</a></h1><pre>  (also mail bomb) [Usenet] 1. v. To send, or
   urge others to send, massive amounts of <a href="e.htm#email">email</a> to a single
   system or person, esp. with intent to crash or <a href="s.htm#spam">spam</a> the
   recipient's system.  Sometimes done in retaliation for a perceived
   serious offense.  Mailbombing is itself widely regarded as a
   serious offense -- it can disrupt email traffic or other
   facilities for innocent users on the victim's system, and in
   extreme cases, even at upstream sites.  2. n. An automatic
   procedure with a similar effect.  3. n. The mail sent.  Compare
   <a href="l.htm#letterbomb">letterbomb</a>, <a href="n.htm#nastygram">nastygram</a>, <a href="b.htm#blob">BLOB</a> (sense 2).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mailing_list">mailing list</a></h1><pre> n.  (often shortened in context to `list')
   1. An <a href="e.htm#email">email</a> address that is an alias (or <a href="m.htm#macro">macro</a>, though
   that word is never used in this connection) for many other email
   addresses.  Some mailing lists are simple `reflectors',
   redirecting mail sent to them to the list of recipients.  Others
   are filtered by humans or programs of varying degrees of
   sophistication; lists filtered by humans are said to be
   `moderated'.  2. The people who receive your email when you send
   it to such an address.

   Mailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker interaction,
   along with <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a>.  They predate Usenet, having originated
   with the first UUCP and ARPANET connections.  They are often used
   for private information-sharing on topics that would be too
   specialized for or inappropriate to public Usenet groups.  Though
   some of these maintain almost purely technical content (such as the
   Internet Engineering Task Force mailing list), others (like the
   `sf-lovers' list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe) are
   recreational, and many are purely social.  Perhaps the most
   infamous of the social lists was the eccentric bandykin
   distribution; its latter-day progeny, lectroids and
   tanstaafl, still include a number of the oddest and most
   interesting people in hackerdom.

   Mailing lists are easy to create and (unlike Usenet) don't tie up a
   significant amount of machine resources (until they get very large,
   at which point they can become interesting torture tests for mail
   software).  Thus, they are often created temporarily by working
   groups, the members of which can then collaborate on a project
   without ever needing to meet face-to-face.  Much of the material in
   this lexicon was criticized and polished on just such a mailing
   list (called `jargon-friends'), which included all the co-authors
   of Steele-1983.

<h1><a name="main_loop">main loop</a></h1><pre> n.  The top-level control flow construct in an
   input- or event-driven program, the one which receives and acts or
   dispatches on the program's input.  See also <a href="d.htm#driver">driver</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mainframe">mainframe</a></h1><pre> n.  Term originally referring to the cabinet
   containing the central processor unit or `main frame' of a
   room-filling <a href="s.htm#stone_age">Stone_Age</a> batch machine.  After the emergence of
   smaller `minicomputer' designs in the early 1970s, the
   traditional <a href="b.htm#big_iron">big_iron</a> machines were described as `mainframe
   computers' and eventually just as mainframes.  The term carries the
   connotation of a machine designed for batch rather than interactive
   use, though possibly with an interactive timesharing operating
   system retrofitted onto it; it is especially used of machines built
   by IBM, Unisys, and the other great <a href="d.htm#dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s surviving from
   computing's <a href="s.htm#stone_age">Stone_Age</a>.

   It has been common wisdom among hackers since the late 1980s that
   the mainframe architectural tradition is essentially dead (outside
   of the tiny market for <a href="n.htm#number-crunching">number-crunching</a> supercomputers (see
   <a href="c.htm#cray">cray</a>)), having been swamped by the recent huge advances in IC
   technology and low-cost personal computing.  As of 1993, corporate
   America is just beginning to figure this out -- the wave of
   failures, takeovers, and mergers among traditional mainframe makers
   have certainly provided sufficient omens (see <a href="d.htm#dinosaurs_mating">dinosaurs_mating</a>
   ).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="management">management</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Corporate power elites distinguished
   primarily by their distance from actual productive work and their
   chronic failure to manage (see also <a href="s.htm#suit">suit</a>).  Spoken derisively,
   as in "*Management* decided that ...".  2. Mythically, a
   vast bureaucracy responsible for all the world's minor irritations.
   Hackers' satirical public notices are often signed `The Mgt'; this
   derives from the "Illuminatus" novels (see the
   <a href="appb.htm#bibliography">Bibliography</a> in Appendix C).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mandelbug">mandelbug</a></h1><pre> /man'del-buhg/ n.  [from the Mandelbrot set] A
   bug whose underlying causes are so complex and obscure as to make
   its behavior appear chaotic or even non-deterministic.  This term
   implies that the speaker thinks it is a <a href="b.htm#bohr_bug">Bohr_bug</a>, rather than
   a <a href="h.htm#heisenbug">heisenbug</a>.  See also <a href="s.htm#schroedinbug">schroedinbug</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="manged">manged</a></h1><pre> /mahnjd/ n.  [probably from the French `manger'
   or Italian `mangiare', to eat; perhaps influenced by English
   `mange', `mangy'] adj. Refers to anything that is mangled or
   damaged, usually beyond repair.  "The disk was manged after the
   electrical storm."  Compare <a href="m.htm#mung">mung</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mangle">mangle</a></h1><pre> vt.  Used similarly to <a href="m.htm#mung">mung</a> or <a href="s.htm#scribble">scribble</a>,
   but more violent in its connotations; something that is mangled has
   been irreversibly and totally trashed.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mangler">mangler</a></h1><pre> n.  [DEC] A manager.  Compare <a href="m.htm#mango">mango</a>; see also
   <a href="m.htm#management">management</a>.  Note that <a href="s.htm#system_mangler">system_mangler</a> is somewhat
   different in connotation.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mango">mango</a></h1><pre> /mang'go/ n.  [orig. in-house jargon at Symbolics] A
   manager.  Compare <a href="m.htm#mangler">mangler</a>.  See also <a href="d.htm#devo">devo</a> and <a href="d.htm#doco">doco</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="manularity">manularity</a></h1><pre> /man`yoo-la'ri-tee/ n.  [prob. fr. techspeak
   `manual' + `granularity'] A notional measure of the manual
   labor required for some task, particularly one of the sort that
   automation is supposed to eliminate.  "Composing English on paper
   has much higher manularity than using a text editor, especially in
   the revising stage."  Hackers tend to consider manularity a
   symptom of primitive methods; in fact, a true hacker confronted
   with an apparent requirement to do a computing task <a href="b.htm#by_hand">by_hand</a>
   will inevitably seize the opportunity to build another tool (see
   <a href="t.htm#toolsmith">toolsmith</a>).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="marbles">marbles</a></h1><pre> pl.n.  [from mainstream "lost all his/her
   marbles"] The minimum needed to build your way further up some
   hierarchy of tools or abstractions.  After a bad system crash, you
   need to determine if the machine has enough marbles to come up on
   its own, or enough marbles to allow a rebuild from backups, or if
   you need to rebuild from scratch.  "This compiler doesn't even
   have enough marbles to compile <a href="h.htm#hello,_world">hello,_world</a>."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="marginal">marginal</a></h1><pre> adj.  1. Extremely small.  "A marginal increase in
   <a href="c.htm#core">core</a> can decrease <a href="g.htm#gc">GC</a> time drastically."  In everyday
   terms, this means that it is a lot easier to clean off your desk if
   you have a spare place to put some of the junk while you sort
   through it.  2. Of extremely small merit.  "This proposed new
   feature seems rather marginal to me."  3. Of extremely small
   probability of <a href="w.htm#win">win</a>ning.  "The power supply was rather
   marginal anyway; no wonder it fried."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="marginal_hacks">Marginal Hacks</a></h1><pre> n.  Margaret Jacks Hall, a building into
   which the Stanford AI Lab was moved near the beginning of the 1980s
   (from the <a href="d.htm#d._c._power_lab">D._C._Power_Lab</a>).

<h1><a name="marketroid">marketroid</a></h1><pre> /mar'k*-troyd/ n.  alt. `marketing slime',
   `marketeer', `marketing droid', `marketdroid'. A member
   of a company's marketing department, esp. one who promises users
   that the next version of a product will have features that are not
   actually scheduled for inclusion, are extremely difficult to
   implement, and/or are in violation of the laws of physics; and/or
   one who describes existing features (and misfeatures) in ebullient,
   buzzword-laden adspeak.  Derogatory.  Compare <a href="d.htm#droid">droid</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mars">Mars</a></h1><pre> n.  A legendary tragic failure, the archetypal Hacker
   Dream Gone Wrong.  Mars was the code name for a family of PDP-10
   compatible computers built by Systems Concepts (now, The SC Group):
   the multi-processor SC-30M, the small uniprocessor SC-25M, and the
   never-built superprocessor SC-40M.  These machines were marvels of
   engineering design; although not much slower than the unique
   <a href="f.htm#foonly">Foonly</a> F-1, they were physically smaller and consumed less
   power than the much slower DEC KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4
   machines.  They were also completely compatible with the DEC KL10,
   and ran all KL10 binaries (including the operating system) with no
   modifications at about 2--3 times faster than a KL10.

   When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983, Systems Concepts
   should have made a bundle selling their machine into shops with a
   lot of software investment in PDP-10s, and in fact their spring
   1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the
   PDP-10 world.  TOPS-10 was running on the Mars by the summer of
   1984, and TOPS-20 by early fall.  Unfortunately, the hackers
   running Systems Concepts were much better at designing machines
   than at mass producing or selling them; the company allowed itself
   to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism into continually
   improving the design, and lost credibility as delivery dates
   continued to slip.  They also overpriced the product ridiculously;
   they believed they were competing with the KL10 and VAX 8600 and
   failed to reckon with the likes of Sun Microsystems and other
   hungry startups building workstations with power comparable to the
   KL10 at a fraction of the price.  By the time SC shipped the first
   SC-30M to Stanford in late 1985, most customers had already made
   the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP-10, usually for VMS or
   UNIX boxes.  Most of the Mars computers built ended up being
   purchased by CompuServe.

   This tale and the related saga of <a href="f.htm#foonly">Foonly</a> hold a lesson for
   hackers: if you want to play in the <a href="r.htm#real_world">Real_World</a>, you need to
   learn Real World moves.

<h1><a name="martian">martian</a></h1><pre> n.  A packet sent on a TCP/IP network with a source
   address of the test loopback interface [127.0.0.1].  This means

   Richard Dawkins] An idea considered as a <a href="r.htm#replicator">replicator</a>, esp.
   with the connotation that memes parasitize people into propagating
   them much as viruses do.  Used esp. in the phrase `meme
   complex' denoting a group of mutually supporting memes that form an
   organized belief system, such as a religion.  This lexicon is an
   (epidemiological) vector of the `hacker subculture' meme complex;
   each entry might be considered a meme.  However, `meme' is often
   misused to mean `meme complex'.  Use of the term connotes
   acceptance of the idea that in humans (and presumably other tool-
   and language-using sophonts) cultural evolution by selection of
   adaptive ideas has superseded biological evolution by selection of
   hereditary traits.  Hackers find this idea congenial for tolerably
   obvious reasons.

   religion are often considered to be examples.  This usage is given

<h1><a name="memory_leak">memory leak</a></h1><pre> n.  An error in a program's dynamic-store

   Also (esp. at CMU) called <a href="c.htm#core_leak">core_leak</a>.  These problems were
   severe on older machines with small, fixed-size address spaces, and
   special "leak detection" tools were commonly written to root them
   out.  With the advent of virtual memory, it is unfortunately easier
   to be sloppy about wasting a bit of memory (although when you run
   out of memory on a VM machine, it means you've got a *real*

<h1><a name="meta">meta</a></h1><pre> /me't*/ or /may't*/ or (Commonwealth) /mee't*/
   adj.,pref.  [from analytic philosophy] One level of

   used to describe syntax, and meta-language is language used to
   describe language.  This is difficult to explain briefly, but much

<h1><a name="meta_bit">meta bit</a></h1><pre> n.  The top bit of an 8-bit character, which is on

   , or <a href="h.htm#hobbit">hobbit</a>.  Some terminals and consoles (see

   (including, *mirabile dictu*, keyboards on IBM PC-class
   machines) have an ALT key.  See also <a href="b.htm#bucky_bits">bucky_bits</a>.

   Historical note: although in modern usage shaped by a universe of
   8-bit bytes the meta bit is invariably hex 80 (octal 0200), things
   were different on earlier machines with 36-bit words and 9-bit
   bytes.  The MIT and Stanford keyboards (see <a href="s.htm#space-cadet_keyboard">space-cadet_keyboard</a>
   ) generated hex 100 (octal 400) from their meta keys.

<h1><a name="metasyntactic_variable">metasyntactic variable</a></h1><pre> n.  A name used in examples and
   understood to stand for whatever thing is under discussion, or any
   random member of a class of things under discussion.  The word
   <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a> is the <a href="c.htm#canonical">canonical</a> example.  To avoid confusion,
   hackers never (well, hardly ever) use `foo' or other words like
   it as permanent names for anything.  In filenames, a common
   convention is that any filename beginning with a
   metasyntactic-variable name is a <a href="s.htm#scratch">scratch</a> file that may be
   deleted at any time.

   To some extent, the list of one's preferred metasyntactic variables
   is a cultural signature.  They occur both in series (used for
   related groups of variables or objects) and as singletons.  Here
   are a few common signatures:

     <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a>, <a href="b.htm#bar">bar</a>, <a href="b.htm#baz">baz</a>, <a href="q.htm#quux">quux</a>, quuux, quuuux...:
          MIT/Stanford usage, now found everywhere (thanks largely to
          early versions of this lexicon!).  At MIT (but not at
          Stanford), <a href="b.htm#baz">baz</a> dropped out of use for a while in the 1970s
          and '80s. A common recent mutation of this sequence inserts
          <a href="q.htm#qux">qux</a> before <a href="q.htm#quux">quux</a>.
     bazola, ztesch:

          Italy.  Pippo /pee'po/ and Paperino /pa-per-ee'-no/ are the
          Italian names for Goofy and Donald Duck.
     aap, noot, mies
          The Netherlands.  These are the first words a child used to
          learn to spell on a Dutch spelling board.

   Of all these, only `foo' and `bar' are universal (and <a href="b.htm#baz">baz</a>
   nearly so).  The compounds <a href="f.htm#foobar">foobar</a> and `foobaz' also enjoy
   very wide currency.

   Some jargon terms are also used as metasyntactic names; <a href="b.htm#barf">barf</a>
   and <a href="m.htm#mumble">mumble</a>, for example.  See also <a href="c.htm#commonwealth_hackish">Commonwealth_Hackish</a>

<h1><a name="mftl">MFTL</a></h1><pre> /M-F-T-L/  [abbreviation: `My Favorite Toy Language']
   1. adj.  Describes a talk on a programming language design that is
   heavy on the syntax (with lots of BNF), sometimes even talks about
   semantics (e.g., type systems), but rarely, if ever, has any
   content (see <a href="c.htm#content-free">content-free</a>).  More broadly applied to talks ---
   even when the topic is not a programming language -- in which the
   subject matter is gone into in unnecessary and meticulous detail at
   the sacrifice of any conceptual content.  "Well, it was a typical
   MFTL talk".  2. n. Describes a language about which the developers
   are passionate (often to the point of prosyletic zeal) but no one
   else cares about.  Applied to the language by those outside the
   originating group.  "He cornered me about type resolution in his
   MFTL."

   The first great goal in the mind of the designer of an MFTL is
   usually to write a compiler for it, then bootstrap the design away
   from contamination by lesser languages by writing a compiler for it
   in itself.  Thus, the standard put-down question at an MFTL talk is
   "Has it been used for anything besides its own compiler?".  On
   the other hand, a language that *cannot* be used to write
   its own compiler is beneath contempt.  See <a href="b.htm#break-even_point">break-even_point</a>.

   (On a related note, Doug McIlroy once proposed a test of the
   generality and utility of a language and the operating system under
   which it is compiled: "Is the output of a FORTRAN program
   acceptable as input to the FORTRAN compiler?"  In other words, can
   you write programs that write programs? (See <a href="t.htm#toolsmith">toolsmith</a>.)
   Alarming numbers of (language, OS) pairs fail this test,
   particularly when the language is FORTRAN; aficionados are quick to
   point out that <a href="u.htm#unix">UNIX</a> (even using FORTRAN) passes it handily.
   That the test could ever be failed is only surprising to those who
   have had the good fortune to have worked only under modern systems
   which lack OS-supported and -imposed "file types".)

<h1><a name="micro-">micro-</a></h1><pre> pref.  1. Very small; this is the root of its use as
   a quantifier prefix.  2. A quantifier prefix, calling for
   multiplication by 10^(-6) (see <a href="q.htm#quantifiers">quantifiers</a>).
   Neither of these uses is peculiar to hackers, but hackers tend to
   fling them both around rather more freely than is countenanced in
   standard English.  It is recorded, for example, that one CS
   professor used to characterize the standard length of his lectures
   as a microcentury -- that is, about 52.6 minutes (see also
   <a href="a.htm#attoparsec">attoparsec</a>, <a href="n.htm#nanoacre">nanoacre</a>, and especially
   <a href="m.htm#microfortnight">microfortnight</a>).  3. Personal or human-scale -- that is,
   capable of being maintained or comprehended or manipulated by one
   human being.  This sense is generalized from `microcomputer',
   and is esp. used in contrast with `macro-' (the corresponding
   Greek prefix meaning `large').  4. Local as opposed to global (or
   <a href="m.htm#macro-">macro-</a>).  Thus a hacker might say that buying a smaller car to
   reduce pollution only solves a microproblem; the macroproblem of
   getting to work might be better solved by using mass transit,
   moving to within walking distance, or (best of all) telecommuting.

   This term may be headed for obsolescence as 5.25-inchers pass out

<h1><a name="microfortnight">microfortnight</a></h1><pre> n.  1/1000000 of the fundamental unit of time
   in the Furlong/Firkin/Fortnight system of measurement; 1.2096 sec.
   (A furlong is 1/8th of a mile; a firkin is 1/4th of a barrel; the
   mass unit of the system is taken to be a firkin of water).  The VMS
   operating system has a lot of tuning parameters that you can set
   with the SYSGEN utility, and one of these is TIMEPROMPTWAIT, the
   time the system will wait for an operator to set the correct date
   and time at boot if it realizes that the current value is bogus.
   This time is specified in microfortnights!

   the largest unit practical for everyday use.  The microLenat,
   originally invented by David Jefferson, was promulgated as an
   attack against noted computer scientist Doug Lenat by a <a href="t.htm#tenured_graduate_student">tenured_graduate_student</a>
    at CMU.  Doug had failed the student on an
   important exam for giving only "AI is bogus" as his answer to the
   questions.  The slur is generally considered unmerited, but it has
   become a running gag nevertheless.  Some of Doug's friends argue
   that *of course* a microLenat is bogus, since it is only one
   millionth of a Lenat.  Others have suggested that the unit should
   be redesignated after the grad student, as the microReid.

<h1><a name="microtape">microtape</a></h1><pre> /mi:'kroh-tayp/ n.  Occasionally used to mean a
   DECtape, as opposed to a <a href="m.htm#macrotape">macrotape</a>.  A DECtape is a small
   reel, about 4 inches in diameter, of magnetic tape about an inch
   wide.  Unlike those for today's <a href="m.htm#macrotape">macrotape</a>s, microtape drivers
   allowed random access to the data, and therefore could be used to
   support file systems and even for swapping (this was generally done
   purely for <a href="h.htm#hack_value">hack_value</a>, as they were far too slow for practical
   use).  In their heyday they were used in pretty much the same ways
   one would now use a floppy disk: as a small, portable way to save
   and transport files and programs.  Apparently the term
   `microtape' was actually the official term used within DEC for
   these tapes until someone coined the word `DECtape', which, of
   course, sounded sexier to the <a href="m.htm#marketroid">marketroid</a>s; another version of
   the story holds that someone discovered a conflict with another
   company's `microtape' trademark.

<h1><a name="millilampson">milliLampson</a></h1><pre> /mil'*-lamp`sn/ n.  A unit of talking speed,
   abbreviated mL.  Most people run about 200 milliLampsons.  The
   eponymous Butler Lampson (a CS theorist and systems implementor
   highly regarded among hackers) goes at 1000.  A few people speak
   faster.  This unit is sometimes used to compare the (sometimes
   widely disparate) rates at which people can generate ideas and
   actually emit them in speech.  For example, noted computer
   architect C. Gordon Bell (designer of the PDP-11) is said, with
   some awe, to think at about 1200 mL but only talk at about 300; he
   is frequently reduced to fragments of sentences as his mouth tries

   10^6 per second, not 2^(20)!); often rendered by
   hackers as `Meaningless Indication of Processor Speed' or in
   other unflattering ways.  This joke expresses a nearly universal
   attitude about the value of most <a href="b.htm#benchmark">benchmark</a> claims, said
   attitude being one of the great cultural divides between hackers
   and <a href="m.htm#marketroid">marketroid</a>s.  The singular is sometimes `1 MIP' even
   though this is clearly etymologically wrong.  See also <a href="k.htm#kips">KIPS</a>

<h1><a name="misfeature">misfeature</a></h1><pre> /mis-fee'chr/ or /mis'fee`chr/ n.  A feature
   that eventually causes lossage, possibly because it is not adequate
   for a new situation that has evolved.  Since it results from a
   deliberate and properly implemented feature, a misfeature is not a
   bug.  Nor is it a simple unforeseen side effect; the term implies
   that the feature in question was carefully planned, but its
   long-term consequences were not accurately or adequately predicted
   (which is quite different from not having thought ahead at all).  A
   misfeature can be a particularly stubborn problem to resolve,
   because fixing it usually involves a substantial philosophical
   change to the structure of the system involved.

   Many misfeatures (especially in user-interface design) arise
   because the designers/implementors mistake their personal tastes
   for laws of nature.  Often a former feature becomes a misfeature
   because trade-offs were made whose parameters subsequently change
   (possibly only in the judgment of the implementors).  "Well, yeah,
   it is kind of a misfeature that file names are limited to six
   characters, but the original implementors wanted to save directory
   space and we're stuck with it for now."

   cursor is at the end of a line, in which case the two characters
   before the cursor are exchanged.  While this behavior is perhaps
   surprising, and certainly inconsistent, it has been found through
   extensive experimentation to be what most users want.  This feature
   is a miswart.

<h1><a name="moby">moby</a></h1><pre> /moh'bee/  [MIT: seems to have been in use among
   model railroad fans years ago.  Derived from Melville's "Moby
   Dick" (some say from `Moby Pickle').] 1. adj. Large, immense,
   complex, impressive.  "A Saturn V rocket is a truly moby frob."
   "Some MIT undergrads pulled off a moby hack at the Harvard-Yale
   game."  (See "<a href="appa.htm#the_meaning_of_`hack'">The_Meaning_of_`Hack'</a>").
   2. n. obs. The maximum address space of a machine (see below).  For
   a 680[234]0 or VAX or most modern 32-bit architectures, it is
   4,294,967,296 8-bit bytes (4 gigabytes).  3. A title of address
   (never of third-person reference), usually used to show admiration,
   respect, and/or friendliness to a competent hacker.  "Greetings,
   moby Dave.  How's that address-book thing for the Mac going?"
   4. adj. In backgammon, doubles on the dice, as in `moby sixes',
   `moby ones', etc.  Compare this with <a href="b.htm#bignum">bignum</a> (sense 3):
   double sixes are both bignums and moby sixes, but moby ones are not
   bignums (the use of `moby' to describe double ones is sarcastic).
   Standard emphatic forms: `Moby foo', `moby win', `moby loss'.
   `Foby moo': a spoonerism due to Richard Greenblatt.  5. The
   largest available unit of something which is available in discrete
   increments.  Thus, ordering a "moby Coke" at the local fast-food
   joint is not just a request for a large Coke, it's an explicit
   request for the largest size they sell.

   This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to
   the MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge
   when it was installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical
   memory size for a timesharing system was 72 kilobytes).  Thus, a
   moby is classically 256K 36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or
   PDP-10 moby.  Back when address registers were narrow the term was
   more generally useful, because when a computer had virtual memory
   mapping, it might actually have more physical memory attached to it
   than any one program could access directly.  One could then say
   "This computer has 6 mobies" meaning that the ratio of physical
   memory to address space is 6, without having to say specifically
   how much memory there actually is.  That in turn implied that the
   computer could timeshare six `full-sized' programs without having
   to swap programs between memory and disk.

   Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces
   are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto
   a machine, so most systems have much *less* than one
   theoretical `native' moby of <a href="c.htm#core">core</a>.  Also, more modern
   memory-management techniques (esp. paging) make the `moby
   count' less significant.  However, there is one series of
   widely-used chips for which the term could stand to be revived ---
   the Intel 8088 and 80286 with their incredibly <a href="b.htm#brain-damaged">brain-damaged</a>
   segmented-memory designs.  On these, a `moby' would be the
   1-megabyte address span of a segment/offset pair (by coincidence, a
   PDP-10 moby was exactly 1 megabyte of 9-bit bytes).

<h1><a name="mod">mod</a></h1><pre> vt.,n.  1. Short for `modify' or `modification'.
   Very commonly used -- in fact the full terms are considered

   esp. with reference to bug fixes or minor design changes in
   hardware or software, most esp. with respect to <a href="p.htm#patch">patch</a> sets
   or a <a href="d.htm#diff">diff</a>.  2. Short for <a href="m.htm#modulo">modulo</a> but used *only* for
   its techspeak sense.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mode">mode</a></h1><pre> n.  A general state, usually used with an adjective
   describing the state.  Use of the word `mode' rather than
   `state' implies that the state is extended over time, and
   probably also that some activity characteristic of that state is
   being carried out. "No time to hack; I'm in thesis mode."  In its
   jargon sense, `mode' is most often attributed to people, though
   it is sometimes applied to programs and inanimate objects. In
   particular, see <a href="h.htm#hack_mode">hack_mode</a>, <a href="d.htm#day_mode">day_mode</a>, <a href="n.htm#night_mode">night_mode</a>,
   <a href="d.htm#demo_mode">demo_mode</a>, <a href="f.htm#fireworks_mode">fireworks_mode</a>, and <a href="y.htm#yoyo_mode">yoyo_mode</a>; also
   <a href="t.htm#talk_mode">talk_mode</a>.

   One also often hears the verbs `enable' and `disable' used in
   connection with jargon modes.  Thus, for example, a sillier way of
   saying "I'm going to crash" is "I'm going to enable crash mode
   now".  One might also hear a request to "disable flame mode,
   please".

   In a usage much closer to techspeak, a mode is a special state that
   certain user interfaces must pass into in order to perform certain
   functions.  For example, in order to insert characters into a
   document in the UNIX editor `vi', one must type the "i" key,
   which invokes the "Insert" command.  The effect of this command
   is to put vi into "insert mode", in which typing the "i" key
   has a quite different effect (to wit, it inserts an "i" into the
   document).  One must then hit another special key, "ESC", in
   order to leave "insert mode".  Nowadays, modeful interfaces are
   generally considered <a href="l.htm#losing">losing</a> but survive in quite a few widely
   used tools built in less enlightened times.

<h1><a name="mode_bit">mode bit</a></h1><pre> n.  A <a href="f.htm#flag">flag</a>, usually in hardware, that selects
   between two (usually quite different) modes of operation.  The
   connotations are different from <a href="f.htm#flag">flag</a> bit in that mode bits are
   mainly written during a boot or set-up phase, are seldom explicitly
   read, and seldom change over the lifetime of an ordinary program.
   The classic example was the EBCDIC-vs.-ASCII bit (#12) of the
   Program Status Word of the IBM 360.  Another was the bit on a
   PDP-12 that controlled whether it ran the PDP-8 or the LINC

   clicking, pulldown, pop-up windows program for listing directories.
   The original monty was an infamous weather-reporting program, Monty
   the Amazing Weather Man, written at the USGS.  Monty had a
   widget-packed X-window interface with over 200 buttons; and all
   monty actually *did* was <a href="f.htm#ftp">FTP</a> files off the network.
   2. [Great Britain; commonly capitalized as `Monty' or as `the
   Full Monty'] 16 megabytes of memory, when fitted to an IBM-PC or

   a normal BIOS cannot access more than 16 megabytes of RAM.
   Generally used of a PC, UNIX workstation etc. to mean `fully
   populated with' memory, disk-space or some other desirable
   resource.  This usage is possibly derived from a TV commercial for
   Del Monte fruit juice, in which one of the characters insisted on

   Numerous features, including vaguely UNIX-like but rather broken

   programmers can never agree on basic things like what character to
   use as an option switch or whether to be case-sensitive.  The
   resulting mess is now the highest-unit-volume OS in history.  Often
   known simply as DOS, which annoys people familiar with other
   similarly abbreviated operating systems (the name goes back to the

<h1><a name="mu">mu</a></h1><pre> /moo/  The correct answer to the classic trick question
   "Have you stopped beating your wife yet?".  Assuming that you
   have no wife or you have never beaten your wife, the answer "yes"
   is wrong because it implies that you used to beat your wife and
   then stopped, but "no" is worse because it suggests that you have
   one and are still beating her.  According to various Discordians
   and Douglas Hofstadter the correct answer is usually "mu", a
   Japanese word alleged to mean "Your question cannot be answered
   because it depends on incorrect assumptions".  Hackers tend to be
   sensitive to logical inadequacies in language, and many have
   adopted this suggestion with enthusiasm.  The word `mu' is
   actually from Chinese, meaning `nothing'; it is used in
   mainstream Japanese in that sense, but native speakers do not
   recognize the Discordian question-denying use.  It almost certainly
   derives from overgeneralization of the answer in the following
   well-known Rinzei Zen teaching riddle:

<h1><a name="mud">MUD</a></h1><pre> /muhd/ n.  [acronym, Multi-User Dungeon; alt.
   Multi-User Dimension] 1.  A class of <a href="v.htm#virtual_reality">virtual_reality</a>
   experiments accessible via the Internet.  These are real-time chat
   forums with structure; they have multiple `locations' like an
   adventure game, and may include combat, traps, puzzles, magic, a
   simple economic system, and the capability for characters to build
   more structure onto the database that represents the existing
   world.  2. vi. To play a MUD.  The acronym MUD is often lowercased
   and/or verbed; thus, one may speak of `going mudding', etc.

   Historically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with names of MU-
   form) derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the
   University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants of
   that game still exist today and are sometimes generically called
   BartleMUDs.  There is a widespread myth (repeated,
   unfortunately, by earlier versions of this lexicon) that the name
   MUD was trademarked to the commercial MUD run by Bartle on British
   Telecom (the motto: "You haven't *lived* 'til you've
   *died* on MUD!"); however, this is false -- Richard Bartle
   explicitly placed `MUD' in PD in 1985.  BT was upset at this, as
   they had already printed trademark claims on some maps and posters,
   which were released and created the myth.

   Students on the European academic networks quickly improved on the
   MUD concept, spawning several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD).
   Many of these had associated bulletin-board systems for social
   interaction.  Because these had an image as `research' they
   often survived administrative hostility to BBSs in general.  This,
   together with the fact that Usenet feeds have been spotty and
   difficult to get in the U.K., made the MUDs major foci of hackish
   social interaction there.

   AberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and
   quickly gained popularity in the U.S.; they became nuclei for large
   hacker communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom
   (some observers see parallels with the growth of Usenet in the
   early 1980s).  The second wave of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants)
   tended to emphasize social interaction, puzzles, and cooperative
   world-building as opposed to combat and competition.  In 1991, over
   50% of MUD sites are of a third major variety, LPMUD, which
   synthesizes the combat/puzzle aspects of AberMUD and older systems
   with the extensibility of TinyMud. The trend toward greater
   programmability and flexibility will doubtless continue.

   The state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly,
   with new simulation designs appearing (seemingly) every month.
   There is now (early 1991) a move afoot to deprecate the term
   <a href="m.htm#mud">MUD</a> itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding variety of
   names corresponding to the different simulation styles being
   explored.  See also <a href="b.htm#bonk/oif">bonk/oif</a>, <a href="f.htm#fod">FOD</a>, <a href="l.htm#link-dead">link-dead</a>,

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mudhead">mudhead</a></h1><pre> n.  Commonly used to refer to a <a href="m.htm#mud">MUD</a> player who
   eats, sleeps, and breathes MUD.  Mudheads have been known to fail
   their degrees, drop out, etc., with the consolation, however, that
   they made wizard level.  When encountered in person, on a MUD, or
   in a chat system, all a mudhead will talk about is three topics:
   the tactic, character, or wizard that is supposedly always unfairly
   stopping him/her from becoming a wizard or beating a favorite MUD;
   why the specific game he/she has experience with is so much better
   than any other; and the MUD he or she is writing or going to write
   because his/her design ideas are so much better than in any
   existing MUD.  See also <a href="w.htm#wannabee">wannabee</a>.

   To the anthropologically literate, this term may recall the
   Zuni/Hopi legend of the mudheads or `koyemshi', mythical
   half-formed children of an unnatural union.  Figures representing
   them act as clowns in Zuni sacred ceremonies.  Others may recall
   the `High School Madness' sequence from the Firesign Theater album
   "Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers", in which there
   is a character named "Mudhead".

<h1><a name="multician">multician</a></h1><pre> /muhl-ti'shn/ n.  [coined at Honeywell,
   ca. 1970] Competent user of <a href="m.htm#multics">Multics</a>.  Perhaps oddly, no one
   has ever promoted the analogous `Unician'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="multics">Multics</a></h1><pre>: /muhl'tiks/ n.  [from "MULTiplexed Information
   and Computing Service"] An early (late 1960s) timesharing
   operating system co-designed by a consortium including MIT, GE, and
   Bell Laboratories.  Multics was very innovative for its time ---
   among other things, it introduced the idea of treating all devices
   uniformly as special files.  All the members but GE eventually
   pulled out after determining that <a href="s.htm#second-system_effect">second-system_effect</a> had
   bloated Multics to the point of practical unusability (the
   `lean' predecessor in question was <a href="c.htm#ctss">CTSS</a>).  Honeywell
   commercialized Multics after buying out GE's computer group, but it
   was never very successful (among other things, on some versions one
   was commonly required to enter a password to log out).  One of the
   developers left in the lurch by the project's breakup was Ken
   Thompson, a circumstance which led directly to the birth of
   <a href="u.htm#unix">UNIX</a>.  For this and other reasons, aspects of the Multics
   design remain a topic of occasional debate among hackers.  See also
   <a href="b.htm#brain-damaged">brain-damaged</a> and <a href="g.htm#gcos">GCOS</a>.

<h1><a name="multitask">multitask</a></h1><pre> n.  Often used of humans in the same meaning it
   has for computers, to describe a person doing several things at
   once (but see <a href="t.htm#thrash">thrash</a>).  The term `multiplex', from
   communications technology (meaning to handle more than one channel
   at the same time), is used similarly.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mumblage">mumblage</a></h1><pre> /muhm'bl*j/ n.  The topic of one's mumbling (see
   <a href="m.htm#mumble">mumble</a>).  "All that mumblage" is used like "all that
   stuff" when it is not quite clear how the subject of discussion
   works, or like "all that crap" when `mumble' is being used as
   an implicit replacement for pejoratives.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="mumble">mumble</a></h1><pre> interj.  1. Said when the correct response is too
   complicated to enunciate, or the speaker has not thought it out.
   Often prefaces a longer answer, or indicates a general reluctance
   to get into a long discussion.  "Don't you think that we could
   improve LISP performance by using a hybrid reference-count
   transaction garbage collector, if the cache is big enough and there
   are some extra cache bits for the microcode to use?"  "Well,
   mumble ... I'll have to think about it."  2. [MIT] Expression
   of not-quite-articulated agreement, often used as an informal vote
   of consensus in a meeting: "So, shall we dike out the COBOL
   emulation?"  "Mumble!"  3. Sometimes used as an expression of
   disagreement (distinguished from sense 2 by tone of voice and other
   cues).  "I think we should buy a <a href="v.htm#vax">VAX</a>."  "Mumble!"  Common
   variant: `mumble frotz' (see <a href="f.htm#frotz">frotz</a>; interestingly, one does
   not say `mumble frobnitz' even though `frotz' is short for
   `frobnitz').  4. Yet another <a href="m.htm#metasyntactic_variable">metasyntactic_variable</a>, like
   <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a>.  5. When used as a question ("Mumble?") means "I
   didn't understand you".  6. Sometimes used in `public' contexts
   on-line as a placefiller for things one is barred from giving
   details about.  For example, a poster with pre-released hardware in
   his machine might say "Yup, my machine now has an extra 16M of
   memory, thanks to the card I'm testing for Mumbleco." 7. A
   conversational wild card used to designate something one doesn't
   want to bother spelling out, but which can be <a href="g.htm#glark">glark</a>ed from
   context.  Compare <a href="b.htm#blurgle">blurgle</a>.  8. [XEROX PARC] A colloquialism
   used to suggest that further discussion would be fruitless.

<h1><a name="munch">munch</a></h1><pre> vt.  [often confused with <a href="m.htm#mung">mung</a>, q.v.] To
   transform information in a serial fashion, often requiring large
   amounts of computation.  To trace down a data structure.  Related
   to <a href="c.htm#crunch">crunch</a> and nearly synonymous with <a href="g.htm#grovel">grovel</a>, but connotes

<h1><a name="munching_squares">munching squares</a></h1><pre> n.  A <a href="d.htm#display_hack">display_hack</a> dating back to the
   PDP-1 (ca. 1962, reportedly discovered by Jackson Wright), which
   employs a trivial computation (repeatedly plotting the graph Y = X
   XOR T for successive values of T -- see <a href="h.htm#hakmem">HAKMEM</a> items
   146--148) to produce an impressive display of moving and growing
   squares that devour the screen.  The initial value of T is treated
   as a parameter, which, when well-chosen, can produce amazing
   effects.  Some of these, later (re)discovered on the LISP machine,
   have been christened `munching triangles' (try AND for XOR and
   toggling points instead of plotting them), `munching w's', and
   `munching mazes'.  More generally, suppose a graphics program
   produces an impressive and ever-changing display of some basic
   form, foo, on a display terminal, and does it using a relatively
   simple program; then the program (or the resulting display) is
   likely to be referred to as `munching foos'.  [This is a good
   example of the use of the word <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a> as a <a href="m.htm#metasyntactic_variable">metasyntactic_variable</a>

<h1><a name="munchkin">munchkin</a></h1><pre> /muhnch'kin/ n.  [from the squeaky-voiced little
   people in L. Frank Baum's "The Wizard of Oz"] A
   teenage-or-younger micro enthusiast hacking BASIC or something else
   equally constricted.  A term of mild derision -- munchkins are
   annoying but some grow up to be hackers after passing through a
   <a href="l.htm#larval_stage">larval_stage</a>.  The term <a href="u.htm#urchin">urchin</a> is also used.  See also

<h1><a name="mundane">mundane</a></h1><pre> n.  [from SF fandom] 1. A person who is not in
   science fiction fandom.  2. A person who is not in the computer
   industry.  In this sense, most often an adjectival modifier as in
   "in my mundane life...." See also <a href="r.htm#real_world">Real_World</a>.

<h1><a name="mung">mung</a></h1><pre> /muhng/ vt.  [in 1960 at MIT, `Mash Until No Good';
   sometime after that the derivation from the <a href="r.htm#recursive_acronym">recursive_acronym</a>
   `Mung Until No Good' became standard; but see <a href="m.htm#munge">munge</a>] 1. To
   make changes to a file, esp. large-scale and irrevocable changes.
   See <a href="b.htm#blt">BLT</a>.  2. To destroy, usually accidentally, occasionally
   maliciously.  The system only mungs things maliciously; this is a
   consequence of <a href="f.htm#finagle's_law">Finagle's_Law</a>.  See <a href="s.htm#scribble">scribble</a>, <a href="m.htm#mangle">mangle</a>,
   <a href="t.htm#trash">trash</a>, <a href="n.htm#nuke">nuke</a>.  Reports from <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> suggest that the
   pronunciation /muhnj/ is now usual in speech, but the spelling
   `mung' is still common in program comments (compare the
   widespread confusion over the proper spelling of <a href="k.htm#kluge">kluge</a>).
   3. The kind of beans of which the sprouts are used in Chinese food.
   (That's their real name!  Mung beans!  Really!)

   Like many early hacker terms, this one seems to have originated at
   <a href="t.htm#tmrc">TMRC</a>; it was already in use there in 1958.  Peter Samson
   (compiler of the original TMRC lexicon) thinks it may originally
   have been onomatopoeic for the sound of a relay spring (contact)
   being twanged.  However, it is known that during the World Wars,
   `mung' was army slang for the ersatz creamed chipped beef better
   known as `SOS', and it seems quite likely that the word in fact
   goes back to Scots-dialect <a href="m.htm#munge">munge</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="munge">munge</a></h1><pre> /muhnj/ vt.  1. [derogatory] To imperfectly
   transform information.  2. A comprehensive rewrite of a routine,
   data structure or the whole program.  3. To modify data in some way
   the speaker doesn't need to go into right now or cannot describe
   succinctly (compare <a href="m.htm#mumble">mumble</a>).

   This term is often confused with <a href="m.htm#mung">mung</a>, which probably was
   derived from it.  However, it also appears the word `munge' was in
   common use in Scotland in the 1940s, and in Yorkshire in the 1950s,
   as a verb, meaning to munch up into a masticated mess, and
   as a noun, meaning the result of munging something up (the
   parallel with the <a href="k.htm#kluge">kluge</a>/<a href="k.htm#kludge">kludge</a> pair is amusing).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="murphy's_law">Murphy's Law</a></h1><pre> prov.  The correct, *original* Murphy's
   Law reads: "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one
   of those ways can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do
   it."  This is a principle of defensive design, cited here because
   it is usually given in mutant forms less descriptive of the
   challenges of design for <a href="l.htm#luser">luser</a>s.  For example, you don't make a
   two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it `THIS WAY UP'; if it
   matters which way it is plugged in, then you make the design
   asymmetrical (see also the anecdote under <a href="m.htm#magic_smoke">magic_smoke</a>).

   Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of the engineers on the rocket-sled
   experiments that were done by the U.S. Air Force in 1949 to test
   human acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981).  One experiment
   involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of
   the subject's body.  There were two ways each sensor could be glued
   to its mount, and somebody methodically installed all 16 the wrong
   way around.  Murphy then made the original form of his
   pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John Paul Stapp)
   quoted at a news conference a few days later.

   Within months `Murphy's Law' had spread to various technical
   cultures connected to aerospace engineering.  Before too many years
   had gone by variants had passed into the popular imagination,
   changing as they went.  Most of these are variants on "Anything
   that can go wrong, will"; this is sometimes referred to as
   <a href="f.htm#finagle's_law">Finagle's_Law</a>.  The memetic drift apparent in these mutants
   clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!

<h1><a name="music">music</a></h1><pre>: n.  A common extracurricular interest of hackers
   (compare <a href="s.htm#science-fiction_fandom">science-fiction_fandom</a>, <a href="o.htm#oriental_food">oriental_food</a>; see also
   <a href="f.htm#filk">filk</a>).  Hackish folklore has long claimed that musical and
   programming abilities are closely related, and there has been at
   least one large-scale statistical study that supports this.
   Hackers, as a rule, like music and often develop musical
   appreciation in unusual and interesting directions.  Folk music is
   very big in hacker circles; so is electronic music, and the sort of
   elaborate instrumental jazz/rock that used to be called
   `progressive' and isn't recorded much any more.  The hacker's
   musical range tends to be wide; many can listen with equal
   appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes, Gentle Giant, Pat
   Metheny, Scott Joplin, Tangerine Dream, Dream Theater, King Sunny
   Ade, The Pretenders, Screaming Trees, or the Brandenburg Concerti.
   It is also apparently true that hackerdom includes a much higher
   concentration of talented amateur musicians than one would expect
   from a similar-sized control group of <a href="m.htm#mundane">mundane</a> types.
