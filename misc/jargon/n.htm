<h1><a name="n">N</a></h1><pre> /N/ quant.  1. A large and indeterminate number of
   objects: "There were N bugs in that crock!"  Also used in
   its original sense of a variable name: "This crock has N
   bugs, as N goes to infinity."  (The true number of bugs is
   always at least N + 1; see <a href="l.htm#lubarsky's_law_of_cybernetic_entomology">Lubarsky's_Law_of_Cybernetic_Entomology</a>
   .)  2. A variable whose value is inherited from the
   current context.  For example, when a meal is being ordered at a
   restaurant, N may be understood to mean however many people
   there are at the table.  From the remark "We'd like to order
   N wonton soups and a family dinner for N - 1" you
   can deduce that one person at the table wants to eat only soup,
   even though you don't know how many people there are (see
   <a href="g.htm#great-wall">great-wall</a>).  3. `Nth': adj. The ordinal counterpart
   of N, senses 1 and 2.  "Now for the Nth and last
   time..." In the specific context "Nth-year grad
   student", N is generally assumed to be at least 4, and is
   usually 5 or more (see <a href="t.htm#tenured_graduate_student">tenured_graduate_student</a>).  See also
   <a href="r.htm#random_numbers">random_numbers</a>, <a href="t.htm#two-to-the-n">two-to-the-N</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nadger">nadger</a></h1><pre> /nad'jr/ v.  [UK] Of software or hardware (not
   people), to twiddle some object in a hidden manner, generally so
   that it conforms better to some format.  For instance, string
   printing routines on 8-bit processors often take the string text
   from the instruction stream, thus a print call looks like `jsr
   print:"Hello world"'.  The print routine has to `nadger' the
   saved instruction pointer so that the processor doesn't try to
   execute the text as instructions when the subroutine returns.

   Apparently this word originated on a now-legendary 1950s radio
   comedy program called "The Goon Show".  The Goon Show usage
   of "nadger" was definitely in the sense of "jinxed"
   "clobbered" "fouled up".  The American mutation <a href="a.htm#adger">adger</a>
   seems to have preserved more of the original flavor.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nagware">nagware</a></h1><pre> /nag'weir/ n.  [Usenet] The variety of <a href="s.htm#shareware">shareware</a>
   that displays a large screen at the beginning or end reminding you
   to register, typically requiring some sort of keystroke to continue
   so that you can't use the software in batch mode.  Compare
   <a href="c.htm#crippleware">crippleware</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nailed_to_the_wall">nailed to the wall</a></h1><pre> adj.  [like a trophy] Said of a bug
   finally eliminated after protracted, and even heroic, effort.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nailing_jelly">nailing jelly</a></h1><pre> vi.  See <a href="l.htm#like_nailing_jelly_to_a_tree">like_nailing_jelly_to_a_tree</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="naive">naive</a></h1><pre> adj.  Untutored in the perversities of some particular
   program or system; one who still tries to do things in an intuitive
   way, rather than the right way (in really good designs these
   coincide, but most designs aren't `really good' in the
   appropriate sense).  This trait is completely unrelated to general
   maturity or competence, or even competence at any other specific
   program.  It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of
   computing that the natural opposite of this term is often claimed
   to be `experienced user' but is really more like `cynical
   user'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="naive_user">naive user</a></h1><pre> n.  A <a href="l.htm#luser">luser</a>.  Tends to imply someone who is
   ignorant mainly owing to inexperience.  When this is applied to
   someone who *has* experience, there is a definite implication
   of stupidity.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nak">NAK</a></h1><pre> /nak/ interj.  [from the ASCII mnemonic for 0010101]
   1. On-line joke answer to <a href="a.htm#ack">ACK</a>?: "I'm not here."  2. On-line
   answer to a request for chat: "I'm not available."  3. Used to
   politely interrupt someone to tell them you don't understand their
   point or that they have suddenly stopped making sense.  See
   <a href="a.htm#ack">ACK</a>, sense 3.  "And then, after we recode the project in
   COBOL...." "Nak, Nak, Nak!  I thought I heard you say
   COBOL!"

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nano">nano</a></h1><pre> /nan'oh/ n.  [CMU: from `nanosecond'] A brief
   period of time.  "Be with you in a nano" means you really will be
   free shortly, i.e., implies what mainstream people mean by "in a
   jiffy" (whereas the hackish use of `jiffy' is quite different
   -- see <a href="j.htm#jiffy">jiffy</a>).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nano-">nano-</a></h1><pre> pref.  [SI: the next quantifier below <a href="m.htm#micro-">micro-</a>;
   meaning * 10^(-9)] Smaller than <a href="m.htm#micro-">micro-</a>, and used in
   the same rather loose and connotative way.  Thus, one has
   <a href="n.htm#nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a> (coined by hacker K. Eric Drexler) by analogy
   with `microtechnology'; and a few machine architectures have a
   `nanocode' level below `microcode'.  Tom Duff at Bell Labs has
   also pointed out that "Pi seconds is a nanocentury".
   See also <a href="q.htm#quantifiers">quantifiers</a>, <a href="p.htm#pico-">pico-</a>, <a href="n.htm#nanoacre">nanoacre</a>, <a href="n.htm#nanobot">nanobot</a>,

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nanoacre">nanoacre</a></h1><pre> /nan'oh-ay`kr/ n.  A unit (about 2 mm square) of
   real estate on a VLSI chip.  The term gets its giggle value from
   the fact that VLSI nanoacres have costs in the same range as real
   acres once one figures in design and fabrication-setup costs.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nanobot">nanobot</a></h1><pre> /nan'oh-bot/ n.  A robot of microscopic
   proportions, presumably built by means of <a href="n.htm#nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>.  As
   yet, only used informally (and speculatively!).  Also called a
   `nanoagent'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nanocomputer">nanocomputer</a></h1><pre> /nan'oh-k*m-pyoo'tr/ n.  A computer with
   molecular-sized switching elements.  Designs for mechanical
   nanocomputers which use single-molecule sliding rods for their
   logic have been proposed.  The controller for a <a href="n.htm#nanobot">nanobot</a> would
   be a nanocomputer.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nanofortnight">nanofortnight</a></h1><pre> n.  [Adelaide University] 1 fortnight *
   10^-9, or about 1.2 msec.  This unit was used largely by students
   doing undergraduate practicals.  See <a href="m.htm#microfortnight">microfortnight</a>,
   <a href="a.htm#attoparsec">attoparsec</a>, and <a href="m.htm#micro-">micro-</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a></h1><pre>: /nan'-oh-tek-no`l*-jee/ n.  A hypothetical
   fabrication technology in which objects are designed and built with
   the individual specification and placement of each separate atom.
   The first unequivocal nanofabrication experiments took place in
   1990, for example with the deposition of individual xenon atoms on
   a nickel substrate to spell the logo of a certain very large
   computer company.  Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the
   hacker subculture ever since the term was coined by K. Eric Drexler
   in his book "Engines of Creation", where he predicted that
   nanotechnology could give rise to replicating assemblers,
   permitting an exponential growth of productivity and personal
   wealth.  See also <a href="b.htm#blue_goo">blue_goo</a>, <a href="g.htm#gray_goo">gray_goo</a>, <a href="n.htm#nanobot">nanobot</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nasal_demons">nasal demons</a></h1><pre> n.  Recognized shorthand on the Usenet group
   comp.std.c for any unexpected behavior of a C compiler on
   encountering an undefined construct.  During a discussion on that
   group in early 1992, a regular remarked "When the compiler
   encounters [a given undefined construct] it is legal for it to make
   demons fly out of your nose" (the implication is that the compiler
   may choose any arbitrarily bizarre way to interpret the code
   without violating the ANSI C standard).  Someone else followed up
   with a reference to "nasal demons", which quickly became
   established.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nastygram">nastygram</a></h1><pre> /nas'tee-gram/ n.  1. A protocol packet or item
   of email (the latter is also called a <a href="l.htm#letterbomb">letterbomb</a>) that takes
   advantage of misfeatures or security holes on the target system to
   do untoward things.  2. Disapproving mail, esp. from a
   <a href="n.htm#net.god">net.god</a>, pursuant to a violation of <a href="n.htm#netiquette">netiquette</a> or a
   complaint about failure to correct some mail- or news-transmission
   problem.  Compare <a href="s.htm#shitogram">shitogram</a>, <a href="m.htm#mailbomb">mailbomb</a>.  3. A status
   report from an unhappy, and probably picky, customer.  "What'd
   Corporate say in today's nastygram?"  4. [deprecated] An error
   reply by mail from a <a href="d.htm#daemon">daemon</a>; in particular, a <a href="b.htm#bounce_message">bounce_message</a>
   .

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nathan_hale">Nathan Hale</a></h1><pre> n.  An asterisk (see also <a href="s.htm#splat">splat</a>,
   <a href="a.htm#ascii">ASCII</a>).  Oh, you want an etymology?  Notionally, from "I
   regret that I have only one asterisk for my country!", a misquote
   of the famous remark uttered by Nathan Hale just before he was
   hanged.  Hale was a (failed) spy for the rebels in the American War
   of Independence.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nature">nature</a></h1><pre> n.  See <a href="h.htm#has_the_x_nature">has_the_X_nature</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="neat_hack">neat hack</a></h1><pre> n.  1. A clever technique.  2. A brilliant
   practical joke, where neatness is correlated with cleverness,
   harmlessness, and surprise value.  Example: the Caltech Rose Bowl
   card display switch (see "<a href="appa.htm#the_meaning_of_`hack'">The_Meaning_of_`Hack'</a>",
   Appendix A).  See also <a href="h.htm#hack">hack</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="neats_vs._scruffies">neats vs. scruffies</a></h1><pre> n.  The label used to refer to one of
   the continuing <a href="h.htm#holy_wars">holy_wars</a> in AI research.  This conflict
   tangles together two separate issues.  One is the relationship
   between human reasoning and AI; `neats' tend to try to build
   systems that `reason' in some way identifiably similar to the
   way humans report themselves as doing, while `scruffies' profess
   not to care whether an algorithm resembles human reasoning in the
   least as long as it works.  More importantly, neats tend to believe
   that logic is king, while scruffies favor looser, more ad-hoc
   methods driven by empirical knowledge.  To a neat, scruffy methods
   appear promiscuous, successful only by accident, and not productive
   of insights about how intelligence actually works; to a scruffy,
   neat methods appear to be hung up on formalism and irrelevant to
   the hard-to-capture `common sense' of living intelligences.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="neep-neep">neep-neep</a></h1><pre> /neep neep/ n.  [onomatopoeic, from New York SF
   fandom] One who is fascinated by computers.  Less specific than
   <a href="h.htm#hacker">hacker</a>, as it need not imply more skill than is required to
   boot games on a PC.  The derived noun `neeping' applies
   specifically to the long conversations about computers that tend to
   develop in the corners at most SF-convention parties (the term
   `neepery' is also in wide use).  Fandom has a related proverb to
   the effect that "Hacking is a conversational black hole!".

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="neophilia">neophilia</a></h1><pre> /nee`oh-fil'-ee-*/ n.  The trait of being
   excited and pleased by novelty.  Common among most hackers, SF
   fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge
   subcultures, including the pro-technology `Whole Earth' wing of
   the ecology movement, space activists, many members of Mensa, and
   the Discordian/neo-pagan underground.  All these groups overlap
   heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share
   characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction, <a href="m.htm#music">music</a>, and
   <a href="o.htm#oriental_food">oriental_food</a>.  The opposite tendency is `neophobia'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="net.-">net.-</a></h1><pre> /net dot/ pref.  [Usenet] Prefix used to describe
   people and events related to Usenet.  From the time before the
   <a href="g.htm#great_renaming">Great_Renaming</a>, when most non-local newsgroups had names
   beginning `net.'.  Includes <a href="n.htm#net.god">net.god</a>s, `net.goddesses'
   (various charismatic net.women with circles of on-line admirers),
   `net.lurkers' (see <a href="l.htm#lurker">lurker</a>), `net.person', `net.parties'
   (a synonym for <a href="b.htm#boink">boink</a>, sense 2), and many similar constructs.
   See also <a href="n.htm#net.police">net.police</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="net.god">net.god</a></h1><pre> /net god/ n.  Accolade referring to anyone who
   satisfies some combination of the following conditions: has been
   visible on Usenet for more than 5 years, ran one of the original
   backbone sites, moderated an important newsgroup, wrote news
   software, or knows Gene, Mark, Rick, Mel, Henry, Chuq, and Greg
   personally.  See <a href="d.htm#demigod">demigod</a>.  Net.goddesses such as Rissa or the
   Slime Sisters have (so far) been distinguished more by personality
   than by authority.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="net.personality">net.personality</a></h1><pre> /net per`sn-al'-*-tee/ n.  Someone who has
   made a name for him or herself on <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a>, through either
   longevity or attention-getting posts, but doesn't meet the other
   requirements of <a href="n.htm#net.god">net.god</a>hood.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="net.police">net.police</a></h1><pre> /net-p*-lees'/ n.  (var. `net.cops') Those
   Usenet readers who feel it is their responsibility to pounce on and
   <a href="f.htm#flame">flame</a> any posting which they regard as offensive or in
   violation of their understanding of <a href="n.htm#netiquette">netiquette</a>.  Generally
   used sarcastically or pejoratively.  Also spelled `net police'.
   See also <a href="n.htm#net.-">net.-</a>, <a href="c.htm#code_police">code_police</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="netbollix">NetBOLLIX</a></h1><pre> n.  [from bollix: to bungle] <a href="i.htm#ibm">IBM</a>'s NetBIOS, an
   extremely <a href="b.htm#brain-damaged">brain-damaged</a> network protocol that, like <a href="b.htm#blue_glue">Blue_Glue</a>
   , is used at commercial shops that don't know any better.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="netburp">netburp</a></h1><pre> n.  [IRC] When <a href="n.htm#netlag">netlag</a> gets really bad, and
   delays between servers exceed a certain threshhold, the <a href="i.htm#irc">IRC</a>
   network effectively becomes partitioned for a period of time, and
   large numbers of people seem to be signing off at the same time and
   then signing back on again when things get better.  An instance of
   this is called a `netburp' (or, sometimes, <a href="n.htm#netsplit">netsplit</a>).
   
</pre><p>
<h1><a name="netdead">netdead</a></h1><pre> n.  [IRC] The state of someone who signs off
   <a href="i.htm#irc">IRC</a>, perhaps during a <a href="n.htm#netburp">netburp</a>, and doesn't sign back on
   until later.  In the interim, he is "dead to the net".

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nethack">nethack</a></h1><pre> /net'hak/ n.  [UNIX] A dungeon game similar to
   <a href="r.htm#rogue">rogue</a> but more elaborate, distributed in C source over
   <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> and very popular at UNIX sites and on PC-class machines
   (nethack is probably the most widely distributed of the freeware
   dungeon games).  The earliest versions, written by Jay Fenlason and
   later considerably enhanced by Andries Brouwer, were simply called
   `hack'.  The name changed when maintenance was taken over by a
   group of hackers originally organized by Mike Stephenson; the
   current contact address (as of mid-1993) is
   nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="netiquette">netiquette</a></h1><pre> /net'ee-ket/ or /net'i-ket/ n.  [portmanteau
   from "network etiquette"] The conventions of politeness
   recognized on <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a>, such as avoidance of cross-posting to
   inappropriate groups and refraining from commercial pluggery
   outside the biz groups.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="netlag">netlag</a></h1><pre> n.  [IRC, MUD] A condition that occurs when the
   delays in the <a href="i.htm#irc">IRC</a> network or on a <a href="m.htm#mud">MUD</a> become severe
   enough that servers briefly lose and then reestablish contact,
   causing messages to be delivered in bursts, often with delays of up
   to a minute.  (Note that this term has nothing to do with
   mainstream "jet lag", a condition which hackers tend not to be
   much bothered by.)
   
</pre><p>
<h1><a name="netnews">netnews</a></h1><pre> /net'n[y]ooz/ n.  1. The software that makes
   <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> run.  2. The content of Usenet.  "I read netnews
   right after my mail most mornings."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="netrock">netrock</a></h1><pre> /net'rok/ n.  [IBM] A <a href="f.htm#flame">flame</a>; used esp. on
   VNET, IBM's internal corporate network.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="netsplit">netsplit</a></h1><pre> n.  Syn. <a href="n.htm#netburp">netburp</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="netter">netter</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Loosely, anyone with a <a href="n.htm#network_address">network_address</a>.
   2. More specifically, a <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> regular.  Most often found in
   the plural.  "If you post *that* in a technical group, you're
   going to be flamed by angry netters for the rest of time!"

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="network_address">network address</a></h1><pre> n.  (also `net address') As used by
   hackers, means an address on `the' network (see <a href="n.htm#network,_the">network,_the</a>
   ; this is almost always a <a href="b.htm#bang_path">bang_path</a> or <a href="i.htm#internet_address">Internet_address</a>
   ).  Such an address is essential if one wants to be to be
   taken seriously by hackers; in particular, persons or organizations
   that claim to understand, work with, sell to, or recruit from among
   hackers but *don't* display net addresses are quietly presumed
   to be clueless poseurs and mentally flushed (see <a href="f.htm#flush">flush</a>, sense
   4).  Hackers often put their net addresses on their business cards
   and wear them prominently in contexts where they expect to meet
   other hackers face-to-face (see also <a href="s.htm#science-fiction_fandom">science-fiction_fandom</a>).
   This is mostly functional, but is also a signal that one identifies
   with hackerdom (like lodge pins among Masons or tie-dyed T-shirts
   among Grateful Dead fans).  Net addresses are often used in email
   text as a more concise substitute for personal names; indeed,
   hackers may come to know each other quite well by network names
   without ever learning each others' `legal' monikers.  See also
   <a href="s.htm#sitename">sitename</a>, <a href="d.htm#domainist">domainist</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="network_meltdown">network meltdown</a></h1><pre> n.  A state of complete network overload;
   the network equivalent of <a href="t.htm#thrash">thrash</a>ing.  This may be induced by a
   <a href="c.htm#chernobyl_packet">Chernobyl_packet</a>.  See also <a href="b.htm#broadcast_storm">broadcast_storm</a>, <a href="k.htm#kamikaze_packet">kamikaze_packet</a>
   .

   Network meltdown is often a result of network designs that are
   optimized for a steady state of moderate load and don't cope well
   with the very jagged, bursty usage patterns of the real world.  One
   amusing instance of this is triggered by the the popular and very
   bloody shoot-'em-up game Doom on the PC.  When used in
   multiplayer mode over a network, the game uses broadcast packets to
   inform other machines when bullets are fired.  This causes problems
   with weapons like the chain gun which fire rapidly -- it can blast
   the network into a meltdown state just as easily as it shreds
   opposing monsters.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="network,_the">network, the</a></h1><pre> n.  1. The union of all the major
   noncommercial, academic, and hacker-oriented networks, such as
   Internet, the old ARPANET, NSFnet, <a href="b.htm#bitnet">BITNET</a>, and the virtual
   UUCP and <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> `networks', plus the corporate in-house
   networks and commercial time-sharing services (such as CompuServe)
   that gateway to them.  A site is generally considered `on the
   network' if it can be reached through some combination of
   Internet-style (@-sign) and UUCP (bang-path) addresses.  See
   <a href="b.htm#bang_path">bang_path</a>, <a href="i.htm#internet_address">Internet_address</a>, <a href="n.htm#network_address">network_address</a>.  2. A
   fictional conspiracy of libertarian hacker-subversives and
   anti-authoritarian monkeywrenchers described in Robert Anton
   Wilson's novel "Schr"odinger's Cat", to which many hackers
   have subsequently decided they belong (this is an example of <a href="h.htm#ha_ha_only_serious">ha_ha_only_serious</a>
   ).

   In sense 1, `network' is often abbreviated to `net'.  "Are
   you on the net?" is a frequent question when hackers first meet
   face to face, and "See you on the net!" is a frequent goodbye.

<h1><a name="new_jersey">New Jersey</a></h1><pre> adj.  [primarily Stanford/Silicon Valley]
   Brain-damaged or of poor design.  This refers to the allegedly
   wretched quality of such software as C, C++, and UNIX (which
   originated at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey).  "This
   compiler bites the bag, but what can you expect from a compiler
   designed in New Jersey?"  Compare <a href="b.htm#berkeley_quality_software">Berkeley_Quality_Software</a>.

<h1><a name="new_testament">New Testament</a></h1><pre> n.  [C programmers] The second edition of
   K&R's "The C Programming Language" (Prentice-Hall, 1988; ISBN
   0-13-110362-8), describing ANSI Standard C.  See <a href="k.htm#k&r">K&R</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="newbie">newbie</a></h1><pre> /n[y]oo'bee/ n.  [orig. from British public-school
   and military slang variant of `new boy'] A Usenet neophyte.  This
   term surfaced in the <a href="n.htm#newsgroup">newsgroup</a> talk.bizarre but is now in
   wide use.  Criteria for being considered a newbie vary wildly; a
   person can be called a newbie in one newsgroup while remaining a
   respected regular in another.  The label `newbie' is sometimes
   applied as a serious insult to a person who has been around Usenet
   for a long time but who carefully hides all evidence of having a
   clue.  See <a href="b.htm#b1ff">B1FF</a>.

<h1><a name="newgroup_wars">newgroup wars</a></h1><pre> /n[y]oo'groop worz/ n.  [Usenet] The salvos of
   dueling `newgroup' and `rmgroup' messages sometimes
   exchanged by persons on opposite sides of a dispute over whether a
   <a href="n.htm#newsgroup">newsgroup</a> should be created net-wide, or (even more
   frequently) whether an obsolete one should be removed.  These
   usually settle out within a week or two as it becomes clear whether
   the group has a natural constituency (usually, it doesn't).  At
   times, especially in the completely anarchic alt hierarchy, the
   names of newsgroups themselves become a form of comment or humor;
   e.g., the spinoff of alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork from
   alt.tv.muppets in early 1990, or any number of specialized
   abuse groups named after particularly notorious <a href="f.htm#flamer">flamer</a>s, e.g.,
   alt.weemba.

<h1><a name="newline">newline</a></h1><pre> /n[y]oo'li:n/ n.  1. [techspeak, primarily UNIX]
   The ASCII LF character (0001010), used under <a href="u.htm#unix">UNIX</a> as a text
   line terminator.  A Bell-Labs-ism rather than a Berkeleyism;
   interestingly (and unusually for UNIX jargon), it is said to have
   originally been an IBM usage.  (Though the term `newline'
   appears in ASCII standards, it never caught on in the general
   computing world before UNIX).  2. More generally, any magic
   character, character sequence, or operation (like Pascal's writeln
   procedure) required to terminate a text record or separate lines.

<h1><a name="news">NeWS</a></h1><pre> /nee'wis/, /n[y]oo'is/ or /n[y]ooz/ n.  [acronym;
   the `Network Window System'] The road not taken in window systems,
   an elegant <a href="p.htm#postscript">PostScript</a>-based environment that would almost
   certainly have won the standards war with <a href="x.htm#x">X</a> if it hadn't been

   too many software vendors haven't yet heeded.  Many hackers insist

<h1><a name="newsgroup">newsgroup</a></h1><pre> n.  [Usenet] One of <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a>'s huge collection of
   topic groups or <a href="f.htm#fora">fora</a>.  Usenet groups can be `unmoderated'
   (anyone can post) or `moderated' (submissions are automatically
   directed to a moderator, who edits or filters and then posts the
   results).  Some newsgroups have parallel <a href="m.htm#mailing_list">mailing_list</a>s for
   Internet people with no netnews access, with postings to the group
   automatically propagated to the list and vice versa.  Some
   moderated groups (especially those which are actually gatewayed
   Internet mailing lists) are distributed as `digests', with groups
   of postings periodically collected into a single large posting with
   an index.

   Among the best-known are comp.lang.c (the C-language forum),
   comp.arch (on computer architectures), comp.unix.wizards
   (for UNIX wizards), rec.arts.sf.written and siblings (for
   science-fiction fans), and talk.politics.misc (miscellaneous
   political discussions and <a href="f.htm#flamage">flamage</a>).

<h1><a name="nightmare_file_system">Nightmare File System</a></h1><pre> n.  Pejorative hackerism for Sun's
   Network File System (NFS).  In any nontrivial network of Suns
   where there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting, when one Sun goes down,
   the others often freeze up.  Some machine tries to access the down
   one, and (getting no response) repeats indefinitely.  This causes
   it to appear dead to some messages (what is actually happening is
   that it is locked up in what should have been a brief excursion to
   a higher <a href="s.htm#spl">spl</a> level).  Then another machine tries to reach
   either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself
   becomes pseudo-down.  The first machine to discover the down one is
   now trying both to access the down one and to respond to the
   pseudo-down one, so it is even harder to reach.  This situation
   snowballs very quickly, and soon the entire network of machines is
   frozen -- worst of all, the user can't even abort the file access
   that started the problem!  Many of NFS's problems are excused by
   partisans as being an inevitable result of its statelessness, which
   is held to be a great feature (critics, of course, call it a great
   <a href="m.htm#misfeature">misfeature</a>).  (ITS partisans are apt to cite this as proof of
   UNIX's alleged bogosity; ITS had a working NFS-like shared file
   system with none of these problems in the early 1970s.)  See also

<h1><a name="nil">NIL</a></h1><pre> /nil/  No.  Used in reply to a question, particularly
   one asked using the `-P' convention.  Most hackers assume this
   derives simply from LISP terminology for `false' (see also
   <a href="t.htm#t">T</a>), but NIL as a negative reply was well-established among
   radio hams decades before the advent of LISP.  The historical
   connection between early hackerdom and the ham radio world was
   strong enough that this may have been an influence.

<h1><a name="ninety-ninety_rule">Ninety-Ninety Rule</a></h1><pre> n.  "The first 90% of the code accounts
   for the first 90% of the development time.  The remaining 10% of
   the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time."
   Attributed to Tom Cargill of Bell Labs, and popularized by Jon
   Bentley's September 1985 "Bumper-Sticker Computer Science"
   column in "Communications of the ACM".  It was there called
   the "Rule of Credibility", a name which seems not to have stuck.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nmi">NMI</a></h1><pre> /N-M-I/ n.  Non-Maskable Interrupt.  An IRQ 7 on the
   PDP-11 or 680[01234]0; the NMI line on an 80[1234]86.  In contrast
   with a <a href="p.htm#priority_interrupt">priority_interrupt</a> (which might be ignored, although
   that is unlikely), an NMI is *never* ignored.  Except, that
   is, on <a href="c.htm#clone">clone</a> boxes, where NMI is often ignored on the
   motherboard because flaky hardware can generate many spurious
   ones.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="no-op">no-op</a></h1><pre> /noh'op/ n,v.  alt. NOP /nop/ [no operation] 1.
   A machine instruction that does nothing (sometimes used in
   assembler-level programming as filler for data or patch areas, or
   to overwrite code to be removed in binaries).  See also <a href="j.htm#jfcl">JFCL</a>.
   2. A person who contributes nothing to a project, or has nothing
   going on upstairs, or both.  As in "He's a no-op."  3. Any
   operation or sequence of operations with no effect, such as
   circling the block without finding a parking space, or putting
   money into a vending machine and having it fall immediately into
   the coin-return box, or asking someone for help and being told to
   go away.  "Oh, well, that was a no-op."  Hot-and-sour soup (see
   <a href="g.htm#great-wall">great-wall</a>) that is insufficiently either is `no-op soup';
   so is wonton soup if everybody else is having hot-and-sour.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="noddy">noddy</a></h1><pre> /nod'ee/ adj.  [UK: from the children's books]
   1. Small and un-useful, but demonstrating a point.  Noddy programs
   are often written by people learning a new language or system.  The
   archetypal noddy program is <a href="h.htm#hello,_world">hello,_world</a>.  Noddy code may be
   used to demonstrate a feature or bug of a compiler.  May be used of
   real hardware or software to imply that it isn't worth using.
   "This editor's a bit noddy."  2. A program that is more or less
   instant to produce.  In this use, the term does not necessarily
   connote uselessness, but describes a <a href="h.htm#hack">hack</a> sufficiently trivial
   that it can be written and debugged while carrying on (and during
   the space of) a normal conversation.  "I'll just throw together a
   noddy <a href="a.htm#awk">awk</a> script to dump all the first fields."  In North
   America this might be called a <a href="m.htm#mickey_mouse_program">mickey_mouse_program</a>.  See

<h1><a name="nominal_semidestructor">Nominal Semidestructor</a></h1><pre> n.  Soundalike slang for `National
   Semiconductor', found among other places in the Networking/2
   networking sources.  During the late 1970s to mid-1980s this
   company marketed a series of microprocessors including the NS16000
   and NS32000 and several variants.  At one point early in the great
   microprocessor race, the specs on these chips made them look like
   serious competition for the rising Intel 80x86 and Motorola 680x0
   series.  Unfortunately, the actual parts were notoriously flaky and
   never implemented the full instruction set promised in their
   literature, apparently because the company couldn't get any of the
   mask steppings to work as designed.  They eventually sank without
   trace, joining the Zilog Z8000 and a few even more obscure
   also-rans in the graveyard of forgotten microprocessors.  Compare

<h1><a name="non-optimal_solution">non-optimal solution</a></h1><pre> n.  (also `sub-optimal solution') An
   astoundingly stupid way to do something.  This term is generally
   used in deadpan sarcasm, as its impact is greatest when the person
   speaking looks completely serious.  Compare <a href="s.htm#stunning">stunning</a>.  See
   also <a href="b.htm#bad_thing">Bad_Thing</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nonlinear">nonlinear</a></h1><pre> adj.  [scientific computation] 1. Behaving in an
   erratic and unpredictable fashion; unstable.  When used to describe
   the behavior of a machine or program, it suggests that said machine
   or program is being forced to run far outside of design
   specifications.  This behavior may be induced by unreasonable
   inputs, or may be triggered when a more mundane bug sends the
   computation far off from its expected course.  2. When describing
   the behavior of a person, suggests a tantrum or a <a href="f.htm#flame">flame</a>.
   "When you talk to Bob, don't mention the drug problem or he'll go
   nonlinear for hours."  In this context, `go nonlinear' connotes
   `blow up out of proportion' (proportion connotes linearity).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nontrivial">nontrivial</a></h1><pre> adj.  Requiring real thought or significant
   computing power.  Often used as an understated way of saying that a
   problem is quite difficult or impractical, or even entirely
   unsolvable ("Proving P=NP is nontrivial").  The preferred
   emphatic form is `decidedly nontrivial'.  See <a href="t.htm#trivial">trivial</a>,

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="not_ready_for_prime_time">not ready for prime time</a></h1><pre> adj.  Usable, but only just so; not
   very robust; for internal use only.  Said of a program or device.
   Often connotes that the thing will be made more solid <a href="r.htm#real_soon_now">Real_Soon_Now</a>
   .  This term comes from the ensemble name of the original cast
   of "Saturday Night Live", the "Not Ready for Prime Time
   Players".  It has extra flavor for hackers because of the special
   (though now semi-obsolescent) meaning of <a href="p.htm#prime_time">prime_time</a>.  Compare
   <a href="b.htm#beta">beta</a>.

</pre><p>

   have originally referred to a particular period of flakiness on
   IBM's VNET corporate network ca. 1988; but there are independent
   reports of the term from elsewhere.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="np-">NP-</a></h1><pre> /N-P/ pref.  Extremely.  Used to modify adjectives
   describing a level or quality of difficulty; the connotation is
   often `more so than it should be' (NP-complete problems all seem
   to be very hard, but so far no one has found a good a priori
   reason that they should be.)  "Coding a BitBlt implementation to
   perform correctly in every case is NP-annoying."  This is
   generalized from the computer-science terms `NP-hard' and
   `NP-complete'.  NP is the set of Nondeterministic-Polynomial
   algorithms, those that can be completed by a nondeterministic
   Turing machine in an amount of time that is a polynomial function
   of the size of the input; a solution for one NP-complete problem
   would solve all the others.  Note, however, that the NP- prefix is,
   from a complexity theorist's point of view, the wrong part of
   `NP-complete' to connote extreme difficulty; it is the
   completeness, not the NP-ness, that puts any problem it describes
   in the `hard' category.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nroff">nroff</a></h1><pre>: /N'rof/  n. [UNIX, from "new roff" (see
   <a href="t.htm#troff">troff</a>)] A companion program to the UNIX typesetter <a href="t.htm#troff">troff</a>,
   accepting identical input but preparing output for terminals and
   line printers.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nsa_line_eater">NSA line eater</a></h1><pre> n.  The National Security Agency trawling
   program sometimes assumed to be reading the net for the
   U.S. Government's spooks.  Most hackers describe it as a mythical
   beast, but some believe it actually exists, more aren't sure, and
   many believe in acting as though it exists just in case.  Some
   netters put loaded phrases like `KGB', `Uzi', `nuclear
   materials', `Palestine', `cocaine', and `assassination' in
   their <a href="s.htm#sig_block">sig_block</a>s in a (probably futile) attempt to confuse and
   overload the creature.  The <a href="g.htm#gnu">GNU</a> version of <a href="e.htm#emacs">EMACS</a> actually
   has a command that randomly inserts a bunch of insidious
   anarcho-verbiage into your edited text.

   There is a mainstream variant of this myth involving a `Trunk Line
   Monitor', which supposedly used speech recognition to extract words
   from telephone trunks.  This one was making the rounds in the
   late 1970s, spread by people who had no idea of then-current
   technology or the storage, signal-processing, or speech recognition
   needs of such a project.  On the basis of mass-storage costs alone
   it would have been cheaper to hire 50 high-school students and just
   let them listen in.  Speech-recognition technology can't do this
   job even now (1993), and almost certainly won't in this millennium,
   either.  The peak of silliness came with a letter to an alternative
   paper in New Haven, Connecticut, laying out the factoids of this
   Big Brotherly affair.  The letter writer then revealed his actual
   agenda by offering -- at an amazing low price, just this once, we
   take VISA and MasterCard -- a scrambler guaranteed to daunt the
   Trunk Trawler and presumably allowing the would-be Baader-Meinhof
   gangs of the world to get on with their business.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nude">nude</a></h1><pre> adj.  Said of machines delivered without an operating
   system (compare <a href="b.htm#bare_metal">bare_metal</a>).  "We ordered 50 systems, but
   they all arrived nude, so we had to spend a an extra weekend with
   the installation tapes."  This usage is a recent innovation
   reflecting the fact that most PC clones are now delivered with DOS
   or Microsoft Windows pre-installed at the factory.  Other kinds of
   hardware are still normally delivered without OS, so this term is
   particular to PC support groups.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="nuke">nuke</a></h1><pre> /n[y]ook/ vt.  1. To intentionally delete the entire
   contents of a given directory or storage volume.  "On UNIX,
   `rm -r /usr' will nuke everything in the usr filesystem."
   Never used for accidental deletion.  Oppose <a href="b.htm#blow_away">blow_away</a>.
   2. Syn. for <a href="d.htm#dike">dike</a>, applied to smaller things such as files,
   features, or code sections.  Often used to express a final verdict.
   "What do you want me to do with that 80-meg <a href="w.htm#wallpaper">wallpaper</a> file?"
   "Nuke it."  3. Used of processes as well as files; nuke is a
   frequent verbal alias for `kill -9' on UNIX.  4. On IBM PCs,
   a bug that results in <a href="f.htm#fandango_on_core">fandango_on_core</a> can trash the operating
   system, including the FAT (the in-core copy of the disk block
   chaining information).  This can utterly scramble attached disks,
   which are then said to have been `nuked'.  This term is also used
   of analogous lossages on Macintoshes and other micros without
   memory protection.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="number-crunching">number-crunching</a></h1><pre> n.  Computations of a numerical nature,
   esp. those that make extensive use of floating-point numbers.
   The only thing <a href="f.htm#fortrash">Fortrash</a> is good for.  This term is in
   widespread informal use outside hackerdom and even in mainstream
   slang, but has additional hackish connotations: namely, that the
   computations are mindless and involve massive use of <a href="b.htm#brute_force">brute_force</a>

   that may not be significant results but at least indicate that the
   program is running.  May be used to placate management, grant
   sponsors, etc.  `Making numbers' means running a program because
   output -- any output, not necessarily meaningful output -- is
   needed as a demonstration of progress.  See <a href="p.htm#pretty_pictures">pretty_pictures</a>,

<h1><a name="nuxi_problem">NUXI problem</a></h1><pre> /nuk'see pro'bl*m/ n.  Refers to the problem
   of transferring data between machines with differing byte-order.
   The string `UNIX' might look like `NUXI' on a machine with a
   different `byte sex' (e.g., when transferring data from a
   <a href="l.htm#little-endian">little-endian</a> to a <a href="b.htm#big-endian">big-endian</a>, or vice-versa).  See also

<h1><a name="nybble">nybble</a></h1><pre> /nib'l/ (alt. `nibble') n.  [from
   v. `nibble' by analogy with `bite' =&gt `byte'] Four
   bits; one <a href="h.htm#hex">hex</a> digit; a half-byte.  Though `byte' is now
   techspeak, this useful relative is still jargon.  Compare
   <a href="b.htm#byte">byte</a>; see also <a href="b.htm#bit">bit</a>, Apparently this spelling is uncommon
   in Commonwealth Hackish, as British orthography suggests the
   pronunciation /ni:'bl/.

   Following `bit', `byte' and `nybble' there have been quite a few
   analogical attempts to construct unambiguous terms for bit blocks
   of other sizes.  All of these are strictly jargon, not techspeak,
   and not very common jargon at that (most hackers would recognize
   them in context but not use them spontaneously).  We collect them
   here for reference together with the ambiguous techspeak terms
   `word', `half-word' and `quadwords'; some (indicated) have
   substantial information separate entries.

   The fundamental motivation for most of these jargon terms (aside
   from the normal hackerly enjoyment of punning wordplay) is the
   extreme ambiguity of the term `word' and its derivatives.
