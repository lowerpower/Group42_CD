<h1><a name="<bobbit>"><bobbit></a></h1><pre> n.  [Usenet: alt.folklore.urban and
   elsewhere] Commonly used as a placeholder for omitted text in a
   followup message. Refers, of course, to the celebrated mutilation
   of John Bobbit.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="4.2">4.2</a></h1><pre> n.  Without a prefix, this almost invariably refers to
   <a href="b.htm#bsd">BSD</a> UNIX release 4.2.  Note that it is an indication of
   cluelessness to say "version 4.2", and "release 4.2" is rare;
   the number stands on its own, or is used in the more explicit forms
   4.2BSD or (less commonly) BSD 4.2.  Similar remarks apply to
   "4.3" and to earlier, less-widespread releases 4.1 and 2.9.,
   and will doubtless apply to 4.4 in the near future.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="'snooze">'Snooze</a></h1><pre> /snooz/ [FidoNet] n.  Fidonews, the weekly
   official on-line newsletter of FidoNet.  As the editorial policy of
   Fidonews is "anything that arrives, we print", there are often
   large articles completely unrelated to FidoNet, which in turn tend
   to elicit <a href="f.htm#flamage">flamage</a> in subsequent issues.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="(tm)">(TM)</a></h1><pre> //  [Usenet] ASCII rendition of the
   trademark-superscript symbol
   appended to phrases that the author feels should be recorded for
   posterity, perhaps in future editions of this lexicon.  Sometimes
   used ironically as a form of protest against the recent spate of
   software and algorithm patents and `look and feel' lawsuits.  See
   also <a href="u.htm#un*x">UN*X</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="-oid">-oid</a></h1><pre> suff.  [from `android'] 1. Used as in mainstream
   English to indicate a poor imitation, a counterfeit, or some
   otherwise slightly bogus resemblance.  Hackers will happily use it
   with all sorts of non-Greco/Latin stem words that wouldn't keep
   company with it in mainstream English.  For example, "He's a
   nerdoid" means that he superficially resembles a nerd but can't
   make the grade; a `modemoid' might be a 300-baud box (Real Modems
   run at 9600 or up); a `computeroid' might be any <a href="b.htm#bitty_box">bitty_box</a>.
   The word `keyboid' could be used to describe a <a href="c.htm#chiclet_keyboard">chiclet_keyboard</a>
   , but would have to be written; spoken, it would confuse
   the listener as to the speaker's city of origin.  2. More
   specifically, an indicator for `resembling an android' which in
   the past has been confined to science-fiction fans and hackers.  It
   too has recently (in 1991) started to go mainstream (most notably
   in the term `trendoid' for victims of terminal hipness).  This is
   probably traceable to the popularization of the term <a href="d.htm#droid">droid</a> in
   "Star Wars" and its sequels.

   Coinages in both forms have been common in science fiction for at
   least fifty years, and hackers (who are often SF fans) have
   probably been making `-oid' jargon for almost that long
   [though GLS and I can personally confirm only that they were
   already common in the mid-1970s -- ESR].

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="-ware">-ware</a></h1><pre> suff.  [from `software'] Commonly used to form
   jargon terms for classes of software.  For examples, see
   <a href="c.htm#careware">careware</a>, <a href="c.htm#crippleware">crippleware</a>, <a href="c.htm#crudware">crudware</a>, <a href="f.htm#freeware">freeware</a>,
   <a href="f.htm#fritterware">fritterware</a>, <a href="g.htm#guiltware">guiltware</a>, <a href="l.htm#liveware">liveware</a>, <a href="m.htm#meatware">meatware</a>,
   <a href="p.htm#payware">payware</a>, <a href="p.htm#psychedelicware">psychedelicware</a>, <a href="s.htm#shareware">shareware</a>, <a href="s.htm#shelfware">shelfware</a>,
   <a href="v.htm#vaporware">vaporware</a>, <a href="w.htm#wetware">wetware</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="/dev/null">/dev/null</a></h1><pre> /dev-nuhl/ n.  [from the UNIX null device, used
   as a data sink] A notional `black hole' in any information space
   being discussed, used, or referred to.  A controversial posting,
   for example, might end "Kudos to rasputin@kremlin.org, flames to
   /dev/null".  See <a href="b.htm#bit_bucket">bit_bucket</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="0">0</a></h1><pre>  Numeric zero, as opposed to the letter `O' (the 15th
   letter of the English alphabet).  In their unmodified forms they
   look a lot alike, and various kluges invented to make them visually
   distinct have compounded the confusion.  If your zero is
   center-dotted and letter-O is not, or if letter-O looks almost
   rectangular but zero looks more like an American football stood on
   end (or the reverse), you're probably looking at a modern character
   display (though the dotted zero seems to have originated as an
   option on IBM 3270 controllers).  If your zero is slashed but
   letter-O is not, you're probably looking at an old-style ASCII
   graphic set descended from the default typewheel on the venerable
   ASR-33 Teletype (Scandinavians, for whom Slashed-O is a letter,
   curse this arrangement).  If letter-O has a slash across it and the
   zero does not, your display is tuned for a very old convention used
   at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers (Scandinavians curse
   *this* arrangement even more, because it means two of their
   letters collide).  Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero
   with a *reversed* slash.  And yet another convention common on
   early line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook
   to the letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive
   capital letter-O (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for
   how to draw ASCII characters, but the final standard changed the
   distinguisher to a tick-mark in the upper-left corner).  Are we
   sufficiently confused yet?

<h1><a name="1tbs">1TBS</a></h1><pre> // n.  The "One True Brace Style"; see <a href="i.htm#indent_style">indent_style</a>
   .

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="120_reset">120 reset</a></h1><pre> /wuhn-twen'tee ree'set/ n.  [from 120 volts,
   U.S. wall voltage] To cycle power on a machine in order to reset or
   unjam it.  Compare <a href="b.htm#big_red_switch">Big_Red_Switch</a>, <a href="p.htm#power_cycle">power_cycle</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="2">2</a></h1><pre> infix.  In translation software written by hackers, infix
   2 often represents the syllable *to* with the connotation
   `translate to': as in dvi2ps (DVI to PostScript), int2string
   (integer to string), and texi2roff (Texinfo to [nt]roff).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="@-party">@-party</a></h1><pre> /at'par`tee/ n.  [from the @-sign in an Internet
   address] (alt. `@-sign party' /at'si:n par`tee/) A
   semi-closed party thrown for hackers at a science-fiction
   convention (esp. the annual Worldcon); one must have a
   <a href="n.htm#network_address">network_address</a> to get in, or at least be in company with
   someone who does.  One of the most reliable opportunities for
   hackers to meet face to face with people who might otherwise be
   represented by mere phosphor dots on their screens.  Compare
   <a href="b.htm#boink">boink</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="@begin">@Begin</a></h1><pre> //  See <a href="notaz.htm#\begin">\begin</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="\begin">\begin</a></h1><pre> //  [from the LaTeX command] With \end, used
   humorously in writing to indicate a context or to remark on the
   surrounded text.  For example:

     \begin<a href="f.htm#flame">flame</a>
     Predicate logic is the only good programming
     language.  Anyone who would use anything else
     is an idiot.  Also, all computers should be
     tredecimal instead of binary.
     \end<a href="f.htm#flame">flame</a>

   The Scribe users at CMU and elsewhere used to use @Begin/@End in
   an identical way (LaTeX was built to resemble Scribe).  On Usenet,
   this construct would more frequently be rendered as `&ltFLAME
   ON&gt' and `&ltFLAME OFF&gt', or `#ifdef FLAME' and `#endif FLAME''.
