<h1><a name="p-mail">P-mail</a></h1><pre> n.  Physical mail, as opposed to <a href="e.htm#email">email</a>.  Synonymous
   with <a href="s.htm#snail-mail">snail-mail</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="p.o.d.">P.O.D.</a></h1><pre> /P-O-D/ Acronym for `Piece Of Data' (as opposed
   to a code section).  Usage: pedantic and rare.  See also <a href="p.htm#pod">pod</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="padded_cell">padded cell</a></h1><pre> n.  Where you put <a href="l.htm#luser">luser</a>s so they can't hurt
   anything.  A program that limits a luser to a carefully restricted
   subset of the capabilities of the host system (for example, the
   `rsh(1)' utility on USG UNIX).  Note that this is different
   from an <a href="i.htm#iron_box">iron_box</a> because it is overt and not aimed at
   enforcing security so much as protecting others (and the luser)
   from the consequences of the luser's boundless naivete (see
   <a href="n.htm#naive">naive</a>).  Also `padded cell environment'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="page_in">page in</a></h1><pre> v.  [MIT] 1. To become aware of one's surroundings
   again after having paged out (see <a href="p.htm#page_out">page_out</a>).  Usually confined
   to the sarcastic comment: "Eric pages in, <a href="f.htm#film_at_11">film_at_11</a>!"
   2. Syn. `swap in'; see <a href="s.htm#swap">swap</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="page_out">page out</a></h1><pre> vi.  [MIT] 1. To become unaware of one's
   surroundings temporarily, due to daydreaming or preoccupation.
   "Can you repeat that?  I paged out for a minute."  See <a href="p.htm#page_in">page_in</a>
   .  Compare <a href="g.htm#glitch">glitch</a>, <a href="t.htm#thinko">thinko</a>.  2. Syn. `swap out'; see

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="paper-net">paper-net</a></h1><pre> n.  Hackish way of referring to the postal
   service, analogizing it to a very slow, low-reliability network.
   Usenet <a href="s.htm#sig_block">sig_block</a>s sometimes include a "Paper-Net:" header
   just before the sender's postal address; common variants of this
   are "Papernet" and "P-Net".  Note that the standard
   <a href="n.htm#netiquette">netiquette</a> guidelines discourage this practice as a waste of
   bandwidth, since netters are quite unlikely to casually use postal
   addresses.  Compare <a href="v.htm#voice-net">voice-net</a>, <a href="s.htm#snail-mail">snail-mail</a>, <a href="p.htm#p-mail">P-mail</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="param">param</a></h1><pre> /p*-ram'/ n.  Shorthand for `parameter'.  See
   also <a href="p.htm#parm">parm</a>; compare <a href="a.htm#arg">arg</a>, <a href="v.htm#var">var</a>.

</pre><p>

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="parity_errors">parity errors</a></h1><pre> pl.n.  Little lapses of attention or (in more
   severe cases) consciousness, usually brought on by having spent all
   night and most of the next day hacking.  "I need to go home and
   crash; I'm starting to get a lot of parity errors."  Derives from
   a relatively common but nearly always correctable transient error
   in RAM hardware.  Parity errors can also afflict mass storage and
   serial communication lines; this is more serious because not always
   correctable.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="parkinson's_law_of_data">Parkinson's Law of Data</a></h1><pre> prov.  "Data expands to fill the
   space available for storage"; buying more memory encourages the
   use of more memory-intensive techniques.  It has been observed over
   the last 10 years that the memory usage of evolving systems tends
   to double roughly once every 18 months.  Fortunately, memory
   density available for constant dollars also tends to double about
   once every 12 months (see <a href="m.htm#moore's_law">Moore's_Law</a>); unfortunately, the
   laws of physics guarantee that the latter cannot continue
   indefinitely.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="parm">parm</a></h1><pre> /parm/ n.  Further-compressed form of <a href="p.htm#param">param</a>.
   This term is an IBMism, and written use is almost unknown
   outside IBM shops; spoken /parm/ is more widely distributed, but
   the synonym <a href="a.htm#arg">arg</a> is favored among hackers.  Compare <a href="a.htm#arg">arg</a>,
   <a href="v.htm#var">var</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="parse">parse</a></h1><pre> [from linguistic terminology] vt.  1. To determine the
   syntactic structure of a sentence or other utterance (close to the
   standard English meaning).  "That was the one I saw you."  "I
   can't parse that."  2. More generally, to understand or
   comprehend.  "It's very simple; you just kretch the glims and then
   aos the zotz."  "I can't parse that."  3. Of fish, to have to
   remove the bones yourself.  "I object to parsing fish", means "I
   don't want to get a whole fish, but a sliced one is okay".  A
   `parsed fish' has been deboned.  There is some controversy over
   whether `unparsed' should mean `bony', or also mean
   `deboned'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pascal">Pascal</a></h1><pre>: n.  An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus
   Wirth on the CDC 6600 around 1967--68 as an instructional tool for
   elementary programming.  This language, designed primarily to keep
   students from shooting themselves in the foot and thus extremely
   restrictive from a general-purpose-programming point of view, was
   later promoted as a general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the
   ancestor of a large family of languages including Modula-2 and
   <a href="a.htm#ada">Ada</a> (see also <a href="b.htm#bondage-and-discipline_language">bondage-and-discipline_language</a>).  The
   hackish point of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a
   devastating (and, in its deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper
   by Brian Kernighan (of <a href="k.htm#k&r">K&R</a> fame) entitled "Why Pascal is
   Not My Favorite Programming Language", which was turned down by the
   technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies.  It was
   eventually published in "Comparing and Assessing Programming
   Languages", edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall,
   1984).  Part of his discussion is worth repeating here, because its
   criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself after ten years of
   improvement and could also stand as an indictment of many other
   bondage-and-discipline languages.  At the end of a summary of the
   case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:

     9. There is no escape

     This last point is perhaps the most important.  The language is
     inadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape
     its limitations.  There are no casts to disable the type-checking
     when necessary.  There is no way to replace the defective
     run-time environment with a sensible one, unless one controls the
     compiler that defines the "standard procedures".  The language is
     closed.

     People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal
     trap.  Because the language is impotent, it must be extended.
     But each group extends Pascal in its own direction, to make it
     look like whatever language they really want.  Extensions for
     separate compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, string data types,
     internal static variables, initialization, octal numbers, bit
     operators, etc., all add to the utility of the language for one
     group but destroy its portability to others.

     I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much
     beyond its original target.  In its pure form, Pascal is a toy
     language, suitable for teaching but not for real programming.

   Pascal has since been almost entirely displaced (by <a href="c.htm#c">C</a>) from the
   niches it had acquired in serious applications and systems
   programming, but retains some popularity as a hobbyist language in
   the MS-DOS and Macintosh worlds.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pastie">pastie</a></h1><pre> /pay'stee/ n.  An adhesive-backed label designed to
   be attached to a key on a keyboard to indicate some non-standard
   character which can be accessed through that key.  Pasties are
   likely to be used in APL environments, where almost every key is
   associated with a special character.  A pastie on the R key, for
   example, might remind the user that it is used to generate the
   rho character.  The term properly refers to
   nipple-concealing devices formerly worn by strippers in concession
   to indecent-exposure laws; compare <a href="t.htm#tits_on_a_keyboard">tits_on_a_keyboard</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="patch">patch</a></h1><pre>  1. n. A temporary addition to a piece of code,
   usually as a <a href="q.htm#quick-and-dirty">quick-and-dirty</a> remedy to an existing bug or
   misfeature.  A patch may or may not work, and may or may not
   eventually be incorporated permanently into the program.
   Distinguished from a <a href="d.htm#diff">diff</a> or <a href="m.htm#mod">mod</a> by the fact that a patch
   is generated by more primitive means than the rest of the program;
   the classical examples are instructions modified by using the front
   panel switches, and changes made directly to the binary executable
   of a program originally written in an <a href="h.htm#hll">HLL</a>.  Compare
   <a href="o.htm#one-line_fix">one-line_fix</a>.  2. vt. To insert a patch into a piece of code.
   3. [in the UNIX world] n. A <a href="d.htm#diff">diff</a> (sense 2).  4. A set of
   modifications to binaries to be applied by a patching program.  IBM
   operating systems often receive updates to the operating system in
   the form of absolute hexadecimal patches.  If you have modified
   your OS, you have to disassemble these back to the source.  The
   patches might later be corrected by other patches on top of them
   (patches were said to "grow scar tissue").  The result was often
   a convoluted <a href="p.htm#patch_space">patch_space</a> and headaches galore.  5. [UNIX] the
   `patch(1)' program, written by Larry Wall, which automatically
   applies a patch (sense 3) to a set of source code.

   There is a classic story of a <a href="t.htm#tiger_team">tiger_team</a> penetrating a secure
   military computer that illustrates the danger inherent in binary
   patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can't -- or don't ---
   inspect and examine before installing).  They couldn't find any
   <a href="t.htm#trap_door">trap_door</a>s or any way to penetrate security of IBM's OS, so
   they made a site visit to an IBM office (remember, these were
   official military types who were purportedly on official business),
   swiped some IBM stationery, and created a fake patch.  The patch
   was actually the trapdoor they needed.  The patch was distributed
   at about the right time for an IBM patch, had official stationery
   and all accompanying documentation, and was dutifully installed.
   The installation manager very shortly thereafter learned something
   about proper procedures.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="patch_space">patch space</a></h1><pre> n.  An unused block of bits left in a binary so
   that it can later be modified by insertion of machine-language
   instructions there (typically, the patch space is modified to
   contain new code, and the superseded code is patched to contain a
   jump or call to the patch space).  The widening use of HLLs has
   made this term rare; it is now primarily historical outside IBM
   shops.  See <a href="p.htm#patch">patch</a> (sense 4), <a href="z.htm#zap">zap</a> (sense 4), <a href="h.htm#hook">hook</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="path">path</a></h1><pre> n.  1. A <a href="b.htm#bang_path">bang_path</a> or explicitly routed
   <a href="i.htm#internet_address">Internet_address</a>; a node-by-node specification of a link
   between two machines.  2. [UNIX] A filename, fully specified
   relative to the root directory (as opposed to relative to the
   current directory; the latter is sometimes called a `relative
   path').  This is also called a `pathname'.  3. [UNIX and MS-DOS]
   The `search path', an environment variable specifying the
   directories in which the <a href="s.htm#shell">shell</a> (COMMAND.COM, under MS-DOS)
   should look for commands.  Other, similar constructs abound under
   UNIX (for example, the C preprocessor has a `search path' it
   uses in looking for `#include' files).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pathological">pathological</a></h1><pre> adj.  1. [scientific computation] Used of a
   data set that is grossly atypical of normal expected input, esp.
   one that exposes a weakness or bug in whatever algorithm one is
   using.  An algorithm that can be broken by pathological inputs may
   still be useful if such inputs are very unlikely to occur in
   practice.  2. When used of test input, implies that it was
   purposefully engineered as a worst case.  The implication in both
   senses is that the data is spectacularly ill-conditioned or that
   someone had to explicitly set out to break the algorithm in order
   to come up with such a crazy example.  3. Also said of an unlikely
   collection of circumstances.  "If the network is down and comes up
   halfway through the execution of that command by root, the system
   may just crash."  "Yes, but that's a pathological case."  Often
   used to dismiss the case from discussion, with the implication that
   the consequences are acceptable, since they will happen so
   infrequently (if at all) that it doesn't seem worth going to the
   extra trouble to handle that case (see sense 1).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="payware">payware</a></h1><pre> /pay'weir/ n.  Commercial software.  Oppose
   <a href="s.htm#shareware">shareware</a> or <a href="f.htm#freeware">freeware</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pbd">PBD</a></h1><pre> /P-B-D/ n.  [abbrev. of `Programmer Brain Damage']
   Applied to bug reports revealing places where the program was
   obviously broken by an incompetent or short-sighted programmer.
   Compare <a href="u.htm#ubd">UBD</a>; see also <a href="b.htm#brain-damaged">brain-damaged</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pc-ism">PC-ism</a></h1><pre> /P-C-izm/ n.  A piece of code or coding technique
   that takes advantage of the unprotected single-tasking environment
   in IBM PCs and the like, e.g., by busy-waiting on a hardware
   register, direct diddling of screen memory, or using hard timing
   loops.  Compare <a href="i.htm#ill-behaved">ill-behaved</a>, <a href="v.htm#vaxism">vaxism</a>, <a href="u.htm#unixism">unixism</a>.  Also,
   `PC-ware' n., a program full of PC-isms on a machine with a more
   capable operating system.  Pejorative.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pd">PD</a></h1><pre> /P-D/ adj.  Common abbreviation for `public domain',
   applied to software distributed over <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> and from Internet
   archive sites.  Much of this software is not in fact public domain
   in the legal sense but travels under various copyrights granting
   reproduction and use rights to anyone who can <a href="s.htm#snarf">snarf</a> a copy.
   See <a href="c.htm#copyleft">copyleft</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pdl">PDL</a></h1><pre> /P-D-L/, /pid'l/, /p*d'l/ or /puhd'l/ 
   1. n. `Program Design Language'.  Any of a large class of formal
   and profoundly useless pseudo-languages in which <a href="m.htm#management">management</a>
   forces one to design programs.  Too often, management expects PDL
   descriptions to be maintained in parallel with the code, imposing
   massive overhead to little or no benefit.  See also <a href="f.htm#flowchart">flowchart</a>.
   2. v. To design using a program design language.  "I've been
   pdling so long my eyes won't focus beyond 2 feet."  3. n. `Page
   Description Language'.  Refers to any language which is used to
   control a graphics device, usually a laserprinter.  The most common
   example is, of course, Adobe's <a href="p.htm#postscript">PostScript</a> language, but there
   are many others, such as Xerox InterPress, etc.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pdl">pdl</a></h1><pre> /pid'l/ or /puhd'l/ n.  [abbreviation for `Push Down
   List'] 1. In ITS days, the preferred MITism for <a href="s.htm#stack">stack</a>.  See
   <a href="o.htm#overflow_pdl">overflow_pdl</a>.  2. Dave Lebling, one of the co-authors of
   <a href="z.htm#zork">Zork</a>; (his <a href="n.htm#network_address">network_address</a> on the ITS machines was at one
   time pdl@dms).  3. Rarely, any sense of <a href="p.htm#pdl">PDL</a>, as these are not
   invariably capitalized.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pdp-10">PDP-10</a></h1><pre> n.  [Programmed Data Processor model 10] The machine
   that made timesharing real.  It looms large in hacker folklore
   because of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many university
   computing facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab,
   Stanford, and CMU.  Some aspects of the instruction set (most
   notably the bit-field instructions) are still considered
   unsurpassed.  The 10 was eventually eclipsed by the VAX machines
   (descendants of the PDP-11) when DEC recognized that the 10 and VAX
   product lines were competing with each other and decided to
   concentrate its software development effort on the more profitable
   VAX.  The machine was finally dropped from DEC's line in 1983,
   following the failure of the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a
   viable new model.  (Some attempts by other companies to market
   clones came to nothing; see <a href="f.htm#foonly">Foonly</a> and <a href="m.htm#mars">Mars</a>.)  This event
   spelled the doom of <a href="i.htm#its">ITS</a> and the technical cultures that had
   spawned the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become
   something of a badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to
   have cut one's teeth on a PDP-10.  See <a href="t.htm#tops-10">TOPS-10</a>, <a href="i.htm#its">ITS</a>,

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pdp-20">PDP-20</a></h1><pre> n.  The most famous computer that never was.
   <a href="p.htm#pdp-10">PDP-10</a> computers running the <a href="t.htm#tops-10">TOPS-10</a> operating system
   were labeled `DECsystem-10' as a way of differentiating them from
   the PDP-11.  Later on, those systems running <a href="t.htm#tops-20">TOPS-20</a> were labeled
   `DECSYSTEM-20' (the block capitals being the result of a lawsuit
   brought against DEC by Singer, which once made a computer called
   `system-10'), but contrary to popular lore there was never a
   `PDP-20'; the only difference between a 10 and a 20 was the
   operating system and the color of the paint.  Most (but not all)
   machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted `Basil Blue', whereas
   most TOPS-20 machines were painted `Chinese Red' (often mistakenly
   called orange).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="peek">peek</a></h1><pre> n.,vt.  (and <a href="p.htm#poke">poke</a>) The commands in most
   microcomputer BASICs for directly accessing memory contents at an
   absolute address; often extended to mean the corresponding
   constructs in any <a href="h.htm#hll">HLL</a> (peek reads memory, poke modifies it).
   Much hacking on small, non-MMU micros consists of `peek'ing
   around memory, more or less at random, to find the location where
   the system keeps interesting stuff.  Long (and variably accurate)
   lists of such addresses for various computers circulate (see
   <a href="i.htm#interrupt_list,_the">interrupt_list,_the</a>).  The results of `poke's at these
   addresses may be highly useful, mildly amusing, useless but neat,
   or (most likely) total <a href="l.htm#lossage">lossage</a> (see <a href="k.htm#killer_poke">killer_poke</a>).

   Since a <a href="r.htm#real_operating_system">real_operating_system</a> provides useful, higher-level
   services for the tasks commonly performed with peeks and pokes on
   micros, and real languages tend not to encourage low-level memory
   groveling, a question like "How do I do a peek in C?" is
   diagnostic of the <a href="n.htm#newbie">newbie</a>.  (Of course, OS kernels often have to
   do exactly this; a real C hacker would unhesitatingly, if
   unportably, assign an absolute address to a pointer variable and
   indirect through it.)

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="pencil_and_paper">pencil and paper</a></h1><pre> n.  An archaic information storage and
   transmission device that works by depositing smears of graphite on
   bleached wood pulp.  More recent developments in paper-based
   technology include improved `write-once' update devices which use
   tiny rolling heads similar to mouse balls to deposit colored
   pigment.  All these devices require an operator skilled at
   so-called `handwriting' technique.  These technologies are
   ubiquitous outside hackerdom, but nearly forgotten inside it.  Most
   hackers had terrible handwriting to begin with, and years of
   keyboarding tend to have encouraged it to degrade further.  Perhaps
   for this reason, hackers deprecate pencil-and-paper technology and
   often resist using it in any but the most trivial contexts.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="peon">peon</a></h1><pre> n.  A person with no special (<a href="r.htm#root">root</a> or <a href="w.htm#wheel">wheel</a>)

   *foovax* for you; I'm only a peon there."

   talking to some percent-s in administration."  Compare
   <a href="r.htm#random">random</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="perf">perf</a></h1><pre> /perf/ n.  Syn. <a href="c.htm#chad">chad</a> (sense 1).  The term
   `perfory' /per'f*-ree/ is also heard.  The term <a href="p.htm#perf">perf</a> may
   also refer to the perforations themselves, rather than the chad
   they produce when torn.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="perfect_programmer_syndrome">perfect programmer syndrome</a></h1><pre> n.  Arrogance; the egotistical
   conviction that one is above normal human error.  Most frequently
   found among programmers of some native ability but relatively
   little experience (especially new graduates; their perceptions may
   be distorted by a history of excellent performance at solving
   <a href="t.htm#toy_problem">toy_problem</a>s).  "Of course my program is correct, there is no

<h1><a name="phase">phase</a></h1><pre>  1. n. The offset of one's waking-sleeping schedule
   with respect to the standard 24-hour cycle; a useful concept among
   people who often work at night and/or according to no fixed
   schedule.  It is not uncommon to change one's phase by as much as 6
   hours per day on a regular basis.  "What's your phase?"  "I've
   been getting in about 8 P.M. lately, but I'm going to <a href="w.htm#wrap_around">wrap_around</a>
    to the day schedule by Friday."  A person who is roughly
   12 hours out of phase is sometimes said to be in `night mode'.
   (The term `day mode' is also (but less frequently) used, meaning
   you're working 9 to 5 (or, more likely, 10 to 6).)  The act of
   altering one's cycle is called `changing phase'; `phase
   shifting' has also been recently reported from Caltech.
   2. `change phase the hard way': To stay awake for a very long
   time in order to get into a different phase.  3. `change phase
   the easy way': To stay asleep, etc.  However, some claim that
   either staying awake longer or sleeping longer is easy, and that it
   is *shortening* your day or night that is really hard (see
   <a href="w.htm#wrap_around">wrap_around</a>).  The `jet lag' that afflicts travelers who
   cross many time-zone boundaries may be attributed to two distinct
   causes: the strain of travel per se, and the strain of changing
   phase.  Hackers who suddenly find that they must change phase
   drastically in a short period of time, particularly the hard way,
   experience something very like jet lag without traveling.

<h1><a name="phase_of_the_moon">phase of the moon</a></h1><pre> n.  Used humorously as a random parameter
   on which something is said to depend.  Sometimes implies
   unreliability of whatever is dependent, or that reliability seems
   to be dependent on conditions nobody has been able to determine.
   "This feature depends on having the channel open in mumble mode,
   having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the moon."  See
   also <a href="h.htm#heisenbug">heisenbug</a>.

   True story: Once upon a time there was a bug that really did depend
   on the phase of the moon.  There was a little subroutine that had
   traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
   approximation to the moon's true phase.  GLS incorporated this
   routine into a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would
   print a timestamp line almost 80 characters long.  Very
   occasionally the first line of the message would be too long and
   would overflow onto the next line, and when the file was later read
   back in the program would <a href="b.htm#barf">barf</a>.  The length of the first line
   depended on both the precise date and time and the length of the
   phase specification when the timestamp was printed, and so the bug
   literally depended on the phase of the moon!

   The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included
   an example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug,
   but the typesetter `corrected' it.  This has since been
   described as the phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.

<h1><a name="phreaking">phreaking</a></h1><pre> /freek'ing/ n.  [from `phone phreak'] 1. The
   art and science of <a href="c.htm#cracking">cracking</a> the phone network (so as, for
example,
   to make free long-distance calls).  2. By extension,
   security-cracking in any other context (especially, but not
   exclusively, on communications networks) (see <a href="c.htm#cracking">cracking</a>).

   At one time phreaking was a semi-respectable activity among
   hackers; there was a gentleman's agreement that phreaking as an
   intellectual game and a form of exploration was OK, but serious
   theft of services was taboo.  There was significant crossover
   between the hacker community and the hard-core phone phreaks who
   ran semi-underground networks of their own through such media as
   the legendary "TAP Newsletter".  This ethos began to break
   down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of the techniques put
   them in the hands of less responsible phreaks.  Around the same
   time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical
   ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came
   to depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card
   numbers.  The crimes and punishments of gangs like the `414 group'
   turned that game very ugly.  A few old-time hackers still phreak
   casually just to keep their hand in, but most these days have
   hardly even heard of `blue boxes' or any of the other
   paraphernalia of the great phreaks of yore.

   UNIX command `ping(8)' can be used to do this manually (note
   that `ping(8)''s author denies the widespread folk etymology
   that the name was ever intended as acronym `Packet INternet
   Groper').  Occasionally used as a phone greeting.  See <a href="a.htm#ack">ACK</a>,
   also <a href="e.htm#enq">ENQ</a>.  2. vt. To verify the presence of.  3. vt. To get

   <a href="m.htm#mailing_list">mailing_list</a> requesting an <a href="a.htm#ack">ACK</a> (in order to verify that
   everybody's addresses are reachable).  "We haven't heard much of
   anything from Geoff, but he did respond with an ACK both times I
   pinged jargon-friends."  5. n. A quantum packet of happiness.
   People who are very happy tend to exude pings; furthermore, one can
   intentionally create pings and aim them at a needy party (e.g., a
   depressed person).  This sense of ping may appear as an
   exclamation; "Ping!" (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum of
   happiness; I have been struck by a quantum of happiness).  The form
   "pingfulness", which is used to describe people who exude pings,
   also occurs.  (In the standard abuse of language, "pingfulness"
   can also be used as an exclamation, in which case it's a much
   stronger exclamation than just "ping"!).  Oppose <a href="b.htm#blargh">blargh</a>.
   

   The funniest use of `ping' to date was described in January 1991 by
   Steve Hayman on the Usenet group comp.sys.next.  He was trying
   to isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to
   a NeXT machine, and got tired of having to run back to his console
   after each cabling tweak to see if the ping packets were getting
   through.  So he used the sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then
   wrote a script that repeatedly invoked `ping(8)', listened for
   an echo, and played back the recording on each returned packet.
   Result?  A program that caused the machine to repeat, over and
   over, "Ping ... ping ... ping ..." as long as the
   network was up.  He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through
   the building with one ear cocked, and found a faulty tee connector
   in no time.

   1889 to 1960, the meter was defined to be the distance between two
   scratches in a platinum-iridium bar kept in that same vault ---
   this replaced an earlier definition as 10^(-7) times the
   distance between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian
   through Paris; unfortunately, this had been based on an inexact
   value of the circumference of the Earth.  From 1960 to 1984 it was
   defined to be 1650763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red line of
   krypton-86 propagating in a vacuum.  It is now defined as the

   saved on the stack] (also capitalized `POP') 1. vt. To remove
   something from a <a href="s.htm#stack">stack</a> or <a href="p.htm#pdl">pdl</a>.  If a person says he/she
   has popped something from his stack, that means he/she has finally
   finished working on it and can now remove it from the list of
   things hanging overhead.  2. When a discussion gets to a level of
   detail so deep that the main point of the discussion is being lost,
   someone will shout "Pop!", meaning "Get back up to a higher
   level!"  The shout is frequently accompanied by an upthrust arm
   with a finger pointing to the ceiling.

   <a href="f.htm#freeware">freeware</a>, in that the author requests only that satisfied
   users send a postcard of their home town or something.  (This
   practice, silly as it might seem, serves to remind users that they
   are otherwise getting something for nothing, and may also be
   psychologically related to real estate `sales' in which $1
   changes hands just to keep the transaction from being a gift.)

   <a href="p.htm#post">post</a> can be nouned).  Distinguished from a `letter' or
   ordinary <a href="e.htm#email">email</a> message by the fact that it is broadcast rather
   than point-to-point.  It is not clear whether messages sent to a
   small mailing list are postings or email; perhaps the best dividing
   line is that if you don't know the names of all the potential
   recipients, it is a posting.

   the same as the <a href="a.htm#admin">admin</a>.  The Internet standard for electronic
   mail (<a href="r.htm#rfc">RFC</a>-822) requires each machine to have a `postmaster'

<h1><a name="postscript">PostScript</a></h1><pre>: n.  A Page Description Language (<a href="p.htm#pdl">PDL</a>),
   based on work originally done by John Gaffney at Evans and
   Sutherland in 1976, evolving through `JaM' (`John and Martin',
   Martin Newell) at <a href="x.htm#xerox_parc">XEROX_PARC</a>, and finally implemented in its
   current form by John Warnock et al. after he and Chuck Geschke
   founded Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1982.  PostScript gets its
   leverage by using a full programming language, rather than a series
   of low-level escape sequences, to describe an image to be printed
   on a laser printer or other output device (in this it parallels
   <a href="e.htm#emacs">EMACS</a>, which exploited a similar insight about editing tasks).
   It is also noteworthy for implementing on-the fly rasterization,
   from Bezier curve descriptions, of high-quality fonts at low (e.g.
   300 dpi) resolution (it was formerly believed that hand-tuned
   bitmap fonts were required for this task).  Hackers consider
   PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all time, and the
   combination of technical merits and widespread availability has
   made PostScript the language of choice for graphical output.

   It is used instead to describe any set of rules that allow
   different machines or pieces of software to coordinate with each
   other without ambiguity.  So, for example, it does include niceties
   about the proper form for addressing packets on a network or the
   order in which one should use the forks in the Dining Philosophers
   Problem.  It implies that there is some common message format and
   an accepted set of primitives or commands that all parties involved

   1. An electronic-mail or <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> persona adopted by a human for
   amusement value or as a means of avoiding negative repercussions of
   one's net.behavior; a `nom de Usenet', often associated with

   <a href="t.htm#tentacle">tentacle</a>.  2. Notionally, a <a href="f.htm#flamage">flamage</a>-generating AI program
   simulating a Usenet user.  Many flamers have been accused of
   actually being such entities, despite the fact that no AI program
   of the required sophistication yet exists.  However, in 1989 there
   was a famous series of forged postings that used a
   phrase-frequency-based travesty generator to simulate the styles of
   several well-known flamers; it was based on large samples of their
   back postings (compare <a href="d.htm#dissociated_press">Dissociated_Press</a>).  A significant
   number of people were fooled by the forgeries, and the debate over
   their authenticity was settled only when the perpetrator came

<h1><a name="pseudoprime">pseudoprime</a></h1><pre> n.  A backgammon prime (six consecutive occupied
   points) with one point missing.  This term is an esoteric pun
   derived from a mathematical method that, rather than determining
   precisely whether a number is prime (has no divisors), uses a
   statistical technique to decide whether the number is `probably'
   prime.  A number that passes this test was, before about 1985,
   called a `pseudoprime' (the terminology used by number theorists
   has since changed slightly; pre-1985 pseudoprimes are now
   `probable primes' and `pseudoprime' has a more restricted meaning
   in modular arithmetic).  The hacker backgammon usage stemmed from
   the idea that a pseudoprime is almost as good as a prime: it does
   the job of a prime until proven otherwise, and that probably won't
   happen.

<h1><a name="punched_card">punched card</a></h1><pre>: n.obs.  [techspeak] (alt. `punch card') The
   signature medium of computing's <a href="s.htm#stone_age">Stone_Age</a>, now obsolescent
   outside of some IBM shops.  The punched card actually predated
   computers considerably, originating in 1801 as a control device for
   mechanical looms.  The version patented by Hollerith and used with
   mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was a piece
   of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm.  There is a widespread myth
   that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used for that
   era's larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have falsified
   this.

   IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married
   the punched card to computers, encoding binary information as
   patterns of small rectangular holes; one character per column,
   80 columns per card.  Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and
   hole shapes were tried at various times.

   The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the
   IBM punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards
   distributed with many varieties of computers even today.  See

   movie tonight."  "I was going to hack all night to get this
   feature in, but I decided to punt" may mean that you've decided
   not to stay up all night, and may also mean you're not ever even
   going to put in the feature.  2. More specifically, to give up on
   figuring out what the <a href="r.htm#right_thing">Right_Thing</a> is and resort to an
   inefficient hack.  3. A design decision to defer solving a problem,
   typically because one cannot define what is desirable sufficiently
   well to frame an algorithmic solution.  "No way to know what the
   right form to dump the graph in is -- we'll punt that for now."
   4. To hand a tricky implementation problem off to some other
   section of the design.  "It's too hard to get the compiler to do
   that; let's punt to the runtime system."
