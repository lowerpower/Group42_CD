<h1><a name="quad">quad</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Two bits; syn. for <a href="q.htm#quarter">quarter</a>, <a href="c.htm#crumb">crumb</a>,
   <a href="t.htm#tayste">tayste</a>.  2. A four-pack of anything (compare <a href="h.htm#hex">hex</a>, sense
   2).  3. The rectangle or box glyph used in the APL language for
   various arcane purposes mostly related to I/O.  Former
   Ivy-Leaguers and Oxford types are said to associate it with
   nostalgic memories of dear old University.

<h1><a name="quadruple_bucky">quadruple bucky</a></h1><pre> n.,obs.  1. On an MIT <a href="s.htm#space-cadet_keyboard">space-cadet_keyboard</a>
   , use of all four of the shifting keys (control, meta,
   hyper, and super) while typing a character key.  2. On a Stanford
   or MIT keyboard in <a href="r.htm#raw_mode">raw_mode</a>, use of four shift keys while
   typing a fifth character, where the four shift keys are the control
   and meta keys on *both* sides of the keyboard.  This was very
   difficult to do!  One accepted technique was to press the
   left-control and left-meta keys with your left hand, the
   right-control and right-meta keys with your right hand, and the
   fifth key with your nose.

   Quadruple-bucky combinations were very seldom used in practice,
   because when one invented a new command one usually assigned it to
   some character that was easier to type.  If you want to imply that
   a program has ridiculously many commands or features, you can say
   something like: "Oh, the command that makes it spin the tapes
   while whistling Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is
   quadruple-bucky-cokebottle."  See <a href="d.htm#double_bucky">double_bucky</a>, <a href="b.htm#bucky_bits">bucky_bits</a>
   , <a href="c.htm#cokebottle">cokebottle</a>.

<h1><a name="quantifiers">quantifiers</a></h1><pre>:  In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric
   prefixes used in the SI (Syst`eme International) conventions for
   scientific measurement have dual uses.  With units of time or
   things that come in powers of 10, such as money, they retain their
   usual meanings of multiplication by powers of 1000 = 10^3.
   But when used with bytes or other things that naturally come in
   powers of 2, they usually denote multiplication by powers of
   1024 = 2^(10).

   Here are the SI magnifying prefixes, along with the corresponding
   binary interpretations in common use:

     prefix  decimal  binary
     kilo-   1000^1   1024^1 = 2^10 = 1,024 
     mega-   1000^2   1024^2 = 2^20 = 1,048,576 
     giga-   1000^3   1024^3 = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 
     tera-   1000^4   1024^4 = 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776 
     peta-   1000^5   1024^5 = 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624 
     exa-    1000^6   1024^6 = 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 
     zetta-  1000^7   1024^7 = 2^70 = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 
     yotta-  1000^8   1024^8 = 2^80 = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 

   Here are the SI fractional prefixes:

     *prefix  decimal     jargon usage*
     milli-  1000^-1     (seldom used in jargon)
     micro-  1000^-2     small or human-scale (see <a href="m.htm#micro-">micro-</a>)
     nano-   1000^-3     even smaller (see <a href="n.htm#nano-">nano-</a>)
     pico-   1000^-4     even smaller yet (see <a href="p.htm#pico-">pico-</a>)
     femto-  1000^-5     (not used in jargon--yet)
     atto-   1000^-6     (not used in jargon--yet)
     zepto-  1000^-7     (not used in jargon--yet)
     yocto-  1000^-8     (not used in jargon--yet)

   The prefixes zetta-, yotta-, zepto-, and yocto- have been included
   in these tables purely for completeness and giggle value; they were
   adopted in 1990 by the `19th Conference Generale des Poids et
   Mesures'.  The binary peta- and exa- loadings, though well
   established, are not in jargon use either -- yet.  The prefix
   milli-, denoting multiplication by 1000^(-1), has always
   been rare in jargon (there is, however, a standard joke about the
   `millihelen' -- notionally, the amount of beauty required to
   launch one ship).  See the entries on <a href="m.htm#micro-">micro-</a>, <a href="p.htm#pico-">pico-</a>, and
   <a href="n.htm#nano-">nano-</a> for more information on connotative jargon use of these
   terms.  `Femto' and `atto' (which, interestingly, derive not
   from Greek but from Danish) have not yet acquired jargon loadings,
   though it is easy to predict what those will be once computing
   technology enters the required realms of magnitude (however, see
   <a href="a.htm#attoparsec">attoparsec</a>).

   There are, of course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of
   10.  In the following table, the `prefix' column is the
   international standard suffix for the appropriate power of ten; the
   `binary' column lists jargon abbreviations and words for the
   corresponding power of 2.  The B-suffixed forms are commonly used
   for byte quantities; the words `meg' and `gig' are nouns that may
   (but do not always) pluralize with `s'.

     prefix   decimal   binary       pronunciation
     kilo-       k      K, KB,       /kay/
     mega-       M      M, MB, meg   /meg/
     giga-       G      G, GB, gig   /gig/,/jig/

   Confusingly, hackers often use K or M as though they were suffix or
   numeric multipliers rather than a prefix; thus "2K dollars", "2M
   of disk space".  This is also true (though less commonly) of G.

   Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is `k'; some use
   this strictly, reserving `K' for multiplication by 1024 (KB is
   thus `kilobytes').

   K, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is
   64 gigabytes and `a K' is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of
   `a G' as short for `a grand', that is, $1000).  Whether one
   pronounces `gig' with hard or soft `g' depends on what one thinks
   the proper pronunciation of `giga-' is.

   Confusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in
   magnitude) -- for example, describing a memory in units of
   500K or 524K instead of 512K -- is a sure sign of the
   <a href="m.htm#marketroid">marketroid</a>.  One example of this: it is common to refer to the
   capacity of 3.5" <a href="m.htm#microfloppies">microfloppies</a> as `1.44 MB' In fact, this is a
   completely <a href="b.htm#bogus">bogus</a> number.  The correct size is 1440 KB, that
   is, 1440 * 1024 = 1474560 bytes.  So the `mega' in `1.44 MB' is
   compounded of two `kilos', one of which is 1024 and the other of
   which is 1000.  The correct number of megabytes would of course be
   1440 / 1024 = 1.40625.  Alas, this fine point is probably lost on
   the world forever.

   [1993 update: hacker Morgan Burke has proposed, to general
   approval on Usenet, the following additional prefixes:

groucho
     10^(-30)
harpo
     10^(-27)
harpi
     10^(27)
grouchi
     10^(30)

   We observe that this would leave the prefixes zeppo-, gummo-, and
   chico- available for future expansion.  Sadly, there is little
   immediate prospect that Mr. Burke's eminently sensible proposal
   will be ratified.]

<h1><a name="quantum_bogodynamics">quantum bogodynamics</a></h1><pre> /kwon'tm boh`goh-di:-nam'iks/ n.  A
   theory that characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources
   (such as politicians, used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and
   <a href="s.htm#suit">suit</a>s in general), bogon sinks (such as taxpayers and
   computers), and bogosity potential fields.  Bogon absorption, of
   course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and machines to
   fail (and may also cause both to emit secondary bogons); however,
   the precise mechanics of the bogon-computron interaction are not
   yet understood and remain to be elucidated.  Quantum bogodynamics
   is most often invoked to explain the sharp increase in hardware and
   software failures in the presence of suits; the latter emit bogons,
   which the former absorb.  See <a href="b.htm#bogon">bogon</a>, <a href="c.htm#computron">computron</a>,

<h1><a name="quarter">quarter</a></h1><pre> n.  Two bits.  This in turn comes from the `pieces
   of eight' famed in pirate movies -- Spanish silver crowns that
   could be broken into eight pie-slice-shaped `bits' to make
   change.  Early in American history the Spanish coin was considered
   equal to a dollar, so each of these `bits' was considered worth
   12.5 cents.  Syn.  <a href="t.htm#tayste">tayste</a>, <a href="c.htm#crumb">crumb</a>, <a href="q.htm#quad">quad</a>.  Usage:
   rare.  General discussion of such terms is under <a href="n.htm#nybble">nybble</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ques">ques</a></h1><pre> /kwes/  1. n. The question mark character (`?',
   ASCII 0111111).  2. interj.  What?  Also frequently verb-doubled as
   "Ques ques?"  See <a href="w.htm#wall">wall</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="quick-and-dirty">quick-and-dirty</a></h1><pre> adj.  Describes a <a href="c.htm#crock">crock</a> put together
   under time or user pressure.  Used esp. when you want to convey
   that you think the fast way might lead to trouble further down the
   road.  "I can have a quick-and-dirty fix in place tonight, but
   I'll have to rewrite the whole module to solve the underlying
   design problem."  See also <a href="k.htm#kluge">kluge</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="quine">quine</a></h1><pre> /kwi:n/ n.  [from the name of the logician Willard
   van Orman Quine, via Douglas Hofstadter] A program that generates a
   copy of its own source text as its complete output.  Devising the
   shortest possible quine in some given programming language is a
   common hackish amusement.  Here is one classic quine:

     ((lambda (x)
       (list x (list (quote quote) x)))
      (quote
         (lambda (x)
           (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))

   This one works in LISP or Scheme.  It's relatively easy to write
   quines in other languages such as Postscript which readily handle
   programs as data; much harder (and thus more challenging!) in
   languages like C which do not.  Here is a classic C quine for ASCII
   machines:

     char*f="char*f=%c%s%c;main()
     {printf(f,34,f,34,10);}%c";
     main(){printf(f,34,f,34,10);}

   For excruciatingly exact quinishness, remove the interior line
   breaks.  Some infamous <a href="o.htm#obfuscated_c_contest">Obfuscated_C_Contest</a> entries have been
   quines that reproduced in exotic ways.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="quote_chapter_and_verse">quote chapter and verse</a></h1><pre> v.  [by analogy with the mainstream
   phrase] To cite a relevant excerpt from an appropriate <a href="b.htm#bible">bible</a>.
   "I don't care if `rn' gets it wrong; `Followup-To: poster' is
   explicitly permitted by <a href="r.htm#rfc">RFC</a>-1036.  I'll quote chapter and
   verse if you don't believe me."  See also <a href="l.htm#legalese">legalese</a>,
   <a href="l.htm#language_lawyer">language_lawyer</a>, <a href="r.htm#rtfs">RTFS</a> (sense 2).

<h1><a name="quotient">quotient</a></h1><pre> n.  See <a href="c.htm#coefficient_of_x">coefficient_of_X</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="quux">quux</a></h1><pre> /kwuhks/ n.  [Mythically, from the Latin
   semi-deponent verb quuxo, quuxare, quuxandum iri; noun form
   variously `quux' (plural `quuces', anglicized to `quuxes')
   and `quuxu' (genitive plural is `quuxuum', for four u-letters
   out of seven in all, using up all the `u' letters in Scrabble).]
   1. Originally, a <a href="m.htm#metasyntactic_variable">metasyntactic_variable</a> like <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a> and
   <a href="f.htm#foobar">foobar</a>.  Invented by Guy Steele for precisely this purpose
   when he was young and naive and not yet interacting with the real
   computing community.  Many people invent such words; this one seems
   simply to have been lucky enough to have spread a little.  In an
   eloquent display of poetic justice, it has returned to the
   originator in the form of a nickname.  2. interj. See <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a>;
   however, denotes very little disgust, and is uttered mostly for the
   sake of the sound of it.  3. Guy Steele in his persona as `The
   Great Quux', which is somewhat infamous for light verse and for the
   `Crunchly' cartoons.  4. In some circles, used as a punning
   opposite of `crux'.  "Ah, that's the quux of the matter!"
   implies that the point is *not* crucial (compare <a href="t.htm#tip_of_the_ice-cube">tip_of_the_ice-cube</a>
   ).  5. quuxy: adj. Of or pertaining to a quux.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="qux">qux</a></h1><pre> /kwuhks/  The fourth of the standard <a href="m.htm#metasyntactic_variable">metasyntactic_variable</a>
   , after <a href="b.htm#baz">baz</a> and before the quu(u...)x series.
   See <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a>, <a href="b.htm#bar">bar</a>, <a href="b.htm#baz">baz</a>, <a href="q.htm#quux">quux</a>.  This appears to be a
   recent mutation from <a href="q.htm#quux">quux</a>, and many versions (especially older
   versions) of the standard series just run <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a>, <a href="b.htm#bar">bar</a>,
   <a href="b.htm#baz">baz</a>, <a href="q.htm#quux">quux</a>, ....

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="qwerty">QWERTY</a></h1><pre> /kwer'tee/ adj.  [from the keycaps at the upper
   left] Pertaining to a standard English-language typewriter keyboard
   (sometimes called the Sholes keyboard after its inventor), as
   opposed to Dvorak or foreign-language layouts or a <a href="s.htm#space-cadet_keyboard">space-cadet_keyboard</a>
    or APL keyboard.

   Historical note: The QWERTY layout is a fine example of a <a href="f.htm#fossil">fossil</a>.
   It is sometimes said that it was designed to slow down the typist,
   but this is wrong; it was designed to allow *faster* typing
   -- under a constraint now long obsolete.  In early typewriters,
   fast typing using nearby type-bars jammed the mechanism.  So Sholes
   fiddled the layout to separate the letters of many common digraphs
   (he did a far from perfect job, though; `th', `tr', `ed', and `er',
   for example, each use two nearby keys).  Also, putting the letters
   of `typewriter' on one line allowed it to be typed with particular
   speed and accuracy for <a href="d.htm#demo">demo</a>s.  The jamming problem was
   essentially solved soon afterward by a suitable use of springs, but
   the keyboard layout lives on.
