<h1><a name="rabbit_job">rabbit job</a></h1><pre> n.  [Cambridge] A batch job that does little, if
   any, real work, but creates one or more copies of itself, breeding
   like rabbits.  Compare <a href="w.htm#wabbit">wabbit</a>, <a href="f.htm#fork_bomb">fork_bomb</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="rain_dance">rain dance</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Any ceremonial action taken to correct a
   hardware problem, with the expectation that nothing will be
   accomplished.  This especially applies to reseating printed circuit
   boards, reconnecting cables, etc.  "I can't boot up the machine.
   We'll have to wait for Greg to do his rain dance."  2. Any arcane
   sequence of actions performed with computers or software in order
   to achieve some goal; the term is usually restricted to rituals
   that include both an <a href="i.htm#incantation">incantation</a> or two and physical activity
   or motion.  Compare <a href="m.htm#magic">magic</a>, <a href="v.htm#voodoo_programming">voodoo_programming</a>, <a href="b.htm#black_art">black_art</a>

<h1><a name="rainbow_series">rainbow series</a></h1><pre> n.  Any of several series of technical
   manuals distinguished by cover color.  The original rainbow series
   was the NCSC security manuals (see <a href="o.htm#orange_book">Orange_Book</a>, <a href="c.htm#crayola_books">crayola_books</a>
   ); the term has also been commonly applied to the PostScript
   reference set (see <a href="r.htm#red_book">Red_Book</a>, <a href="g.htm#green_book">Green_Book</a>, <a href="b.htm#blue_book">Blue_Book</a>,
   <a href="w.htm#white_book">White_Book</a>).  Which books are meant by "`the' rainbow
   series" unqualified is thus dependent on one's local technical
   culture.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="random">random</a></h1><pre> adj.  1. Unpredictable (closest to mathematical
   definition); weird.  "The system's been behaving pretty
   randomly."  2. Assorted; undistinguished.  "Who was at the
   conference?"  "Just a bunch of random business types."
   3. (pejorative) Frivolous; unproductive; undirected.  "He's just a
   random loser."  4. Incoherent or inelegant; poorly chosen; not
   well organized.  "The program has a random set of misfeatures."
   "That's a random name for that function."  "Well, all the names
   were chosen pretty randomly."  5. In no particular order, though
   deterministic.  "The I/O channels are in a pool, and when a file
   is opened one is chosen randomly."  6. Arbitrary.  "It generates
   a random name for the scratch file."  7. Gratuitously wrong, i.e.,
   poorly done and for no good apparent reason.  For example, a
   program that handles file name defaulting in a particularly useless
   way, or an assembler routine that could easily have been coded
   using only three registers, but redundantly uses seven for values
   with non-overlapping lifetimes, so that no one else can invoke it
   without first saving four extra registers.  What <a href="r.htm#randomness">randomness</a>!
   8. n. A random hacker; used particularly of high-school students
   who soak up computer time and generally get in the way.  9. n.
   Anyone who is not a hacker (or, sometimes, anyone not known to the
   hacker speaking); the noun form of sense 2.  "I went to the talk,
   but the audience was full of randoms asking bogus questions".
   10. n. (occasional MIT usage) One who lives at Random Hall.  See
   also <a href="j.htm#j._random">J._Random</a>, <a href="s.htm#some_random_x">some_random_X</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="random_numbers">random numbers</a></h1><pre>: n.  When one wishes to specify a large but
   random number of things, and the context is inappropriate for
   <a href="n.htm#n">N</a>, certain numbers are preferred by hacker tradition (that is,
   easily recognized as placeholders).  These include the following:

     17
          Long described at MIT as `the least random number'; see 23.
     23
          Sacred number of Eris, Goddess of Discord (along with 17 and
          5).
     42
          The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe,
          and Everything. (Note that this answer is completely
          fortuitous.  `:-)')
     69
          From the sexual act.  This one was favored in MIT's ITS
          culture.
     105
          69 hex = 105 decimal, and 69 decimal = 105 octal.
     666
          The Number of the Beast.

   "<a href="appc.htm#the_hitchhiker's_guide_to_the_galaxy">The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy</a>", "The Joy
   of Sex", and the Christian Bible (Revelation 13:18).  See also

<h1><a name="randomness">randomness</a></h1><pre> n.  1. An inexplicable misfeature; gratuitous
   inelegance.  2. A <a href="h.htm#hack">hack</a> or <a href="c.htm#crock">crock</a> that depends on a complex
   combination of coincidences (or, possibly, the combination upon
   which the crock depends for its accidental failure to malfunction).
   "This hack can output characters 40--57 by putting the character
   in the four-bit accumulator field of an XCT and then extracting six
   bits -- the low 2 bits of the XCT opcode are the right thing."
   "What randomness!"  3. Of people, synonymous with `flakiness'.
   The connotation is that the person so described is behaving
   weirdly, incompetently, or inappropriately for reasons which are
   (a) too tiresome to bother inquiring into, (b) are probably as
   inscrutable as quantum phenomena anyway, and (c) are likely to pass
   with time. "Maybe he has a real complaint, or maybe it's just
   randomness.  See if he calls back."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="rape">rape</a></h1><pre> vt.  1. To <a href="s.htm#screw">screw</a> someone or something, violently;
   in particular, to destroy a program or information irrecoverably.
   Often used in describing file-system damage.  "So-and-so was
   running a program that did absolute disk I/O and ended up raping
   the master directory."  2. To strip a piece of hardware for parts.
   3. [CMU/Pitt] To mass-copy files from an anonymous ftp site.
   "Last night I raped Simtel's dskutl directory."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="rare_mode">rare mode</a></h1><pre> adj.  [UNIX] CBREAK mode (character-by-character
   with interrupts enabled).  Distinguished from <a href="r.htm#raw_mode">raw_mode</a> and
   <a href="c.htm#cooked_mode">cooked_mode</a>; the phrase "a sort of half-cooked (rare?) mode"
   is used in the V7/BSD manuals to describe the mode.  Usage: rare.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="raster_blaster">raster blaster</a></h1><pre> n.  [Cambridge] Specialized hardware for
   <a href="b.htm#bitblt">bitblt</a> operations (a <a href="b.htm#blitter">blitter</a>).  Allegedly inspired by
   `Rasta Blasta', British slang for the sort of portable stereo
   Americans call a `boom box' or `ghetto blaster'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="raster_burn">raster burn</a></h1><pre> n.  Eyestrain brought on by too many hours of
   looking at low-res, poorly tuned, or glare-ridden monitors, esp.
   graphics monitors.  See <a href="t.htm#terminal_illness">terminal_illness</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="rat_belt">rat belt</a></h1><pre> n.  A cable tie, esp. the sawtoothed,
   self-locking plastic kind that you can remove only by cutting (as
   opposed to a random twist of wire or a twist tie or one of those
   humongous metal clip frobs).  Small cable ties are `mouse belts'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="rave">rave</a></h1><pre> vi.  [WPI] 1. To persist in discussing a specific
   subject.  2. To speak authoritatively on a subject about which one
   knows very little.  3. To complain to a person who is not in a
   position to correct the difficulty.  4. To purposely annoy another
   person verbally.  5. To evangelize.  See <a href="f.htm#flame">flame</a>.  6. Also used
   to describe a less negative form of blather, such as friendly
   bullshitting.  `Rave' differs slightly from <a href="f.htm#flame">flame</a> in that
   `rave' implies that it is the persistence or obliviousness of the
   person speaking that is annoying, while <a href="f.htm#flame">flame</a> implies somewhat
   more strongly that the tone or content is offensive as well.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="rave_on!">rave on!</a></h1><pre> imp.  Sarcastic invitation to continue a <a href="r.htm#rave">rave</a>,
   often by someone who wishes the raver would get a clue but realizes
   this is unlikely.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ravs">ravs</a></h1><pre> /ravz/, also `Chinese ravs' n.  Jiao-zi (steamed or
   boiled) or Guo-tie (pan-fried).  A Chinese appetizer, known
   variously in the plural as dumplings, pot stickers (the literal
   translation of guo-tie), and (around Boston) `Peking Ravioli'.  The
   term `rav' is short for `ravioli', which among hackers always
   means the Chinese kind rather than the Italian kind.  Both consist
   of a filling in a pasta shell, but the Chinese kind includes no
   cheese, uses a thinner pasta, has a pork-vegetable filling (good
   ones include Chinese chives), and is cooked differently, either by
   steaming or frying.  A rav or dumpling can be cooked any way, but a
   potsticker is always the fried kind (so called because it sticks to
   the frying pot and has to be scraped off).  "Let's get
   hot-and-sour soup and three orders of ravs."  See also
   <a href="o.htm#oriental_food">oriental_food</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="raw_mode">raw mode</a></h1><pre> n.  A mode that allows a program to transfer bits
   directly to or from an I/O device (or, under <a href="b.htm#bogus">bogus</a> systems
   that make a distinction, a disk file) without any processing,
   abstraction, or interpretation by the operating system.  Compare
   <a href="r.htm#rare_mode">rare_mode</a>, <a href="c.htm#cooked_mode">cooked_mode</a>.  This is techspeak under UNIX,
   jargon elsewhere.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="rc_file">rc file</a></h1><pre> /R-C fi:l/ n.  [UNIX: from `runcom files' on
   the <a href="c.htm#ctss">CTSS</a> system ca.1955, via the startup script
   `/etc/rc'] Script file containing startup instructions for an
   application program (or an entire operating system), usually a text
   file containing commands of the sort that might have been invoked
   manually once the system was running but are to be executed
   automatically each time the system starts up.  See also <a href="d.htm#dot_file">dot_file</a>
   , <a href="p.htm#profile">profile</a> (sense 1).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="re">RE</a></h1><pre> /R-E/ n.  Common spoken and written shorthand for
   <a href="r.htm#regexp">regexp</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="read-only_user">read-only user</a></h1><pre> n.  Describes a <a href="l.htm#luser">luser</a> who uses computers
   almost exclusively for reading Usenet, bulletin boards, and/or
   email, rather than writing code or purveying useful information.
   See <a href="t.htm#twink">twink</a>, <a href="t.htm#terminal_junkie">terminal_junkie</a>, <a href="l.htm#lurker">lurker</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="readme_file">README file</a></h1><pre> n.  Hacker's-eye introduction traditionally
   included in the top-level directory of a UNIX source distribution,
   containing a pointer to more detailed documentation, credits,
   miscellaneous revision history, notes, etc.  (The file may be named
   README, or READ.ME, or rarely ReadMe or readme.txt or some other
   variant.)  In the Mac and PC worlds, software is not usually
   distributed in source form, and the README is more likely to
   contain user-oriented material like last-minute documentation
   changes, error workarounds, and restrictions.  When asked, hackers
   invariably relate the README convention to the famous scene in
   Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures In Wonderland" in which
   Alice confronts magic munchies labeled "Eat Me" and "Drink Me".

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="real">real</a></h1><pre> adj.  Not simulated.  Often used as a specific antonym
   to <a href="v.htm#virtual">virtual</a> in any of its jargon senses.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="real_estate">real estate</a></h1><pre> n.  May be used for any critical resource
   measured in units of area.  Most frequently used of `chip real
   estate', the area available for logic on the surface of an
   integrated circuit (see also <a href="n.htm#nanoacre">nanoacre</a>).  May also be used of
   floor space in a <a href="d.htm#dinosaur_pen">dinosaur_pen</a>, or even space on a crowded
   desktop (whether physical or electronic).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="real_hack">real hack</a></h1><pre> n.  A <a href="c.htm#crock">crock</a>.  This is sometimes used
   affectionately; see <a href="h.htm#hack">hack</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="real_operating_system">real operating system</a></h1><pre> n.  The sort the speaker is used to.
   People from the BSDophilic academic community are likely to issue
   comments like "System V?  Why don't you use a *real*
   operating system?", people from the commercial/industrial UNIX
   sector are known to complain "BSD?  Why don't you use a
   *real* operating system?", and people from IBM object
   "UNIX?  Why don't you use a *real* operating system?"  Only
   <a href="m.htm#ms-dos">MS-DOS</a> is universally considered unreal.  See <a href="h.htm#holy_wars">holy_wars</a>,
   <a href="r.htm#religious_issues">religious_issues</a>, <a href="p.htm#proprietary">proprietary</a>, <a href="g.htm#get_a_real_computer!">Get_a_real_computer!</a>

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="real_programmer">Real Programmer</a></h1><pre> n.   [indirectly, from the book
   "Real Men Don't Eat Quiche"] A particular sub-variety of
   hacker: one possessed of a flippant attitude toward complexity that
   is arrogant even when justified by experience.  The archetypal
   `Real Programmer' likes to program on the <a href="b.htm#bare_metal">bare_metal</a> and is
   very good at same, remembers the binary opcodes for every machine
   he has ever programmed, thinks that HLLs are sissy, and uses a
   debugger to edit his code because full-screen editors are for
   wimps.  Real Programmers aren't satisfied with code that hasn't
   been <a href="b.htm#bum">bum</a>med into a state of <a href="t.htm#tense">tense</a>ness just short of
   rupture.  Real Programmers never use comments or write
   documentation: "If it was hard to write", says the Real
   Programmer, "it should be hard to understand."  Real Programmers
   can make machines do things that were never in their spec sheets;
   in fact, they are seldom really happy unless doing so.  A Real
   Programmer's code can awe with its fiendish brilliance, even as its
   crockishness appalls.  Real Programmers live on junk food and
   coffee, hang line-printer art on their walls, and terrify the crap
   out of other programmers -- because someday, somebody else might
   have to try to understand their code in order to change it.  Their
   successors generally consider it a <a href="g.htm#good_thing">Good_Thing</a> that there
   aren't many Real Programmers around any more.  For a famous (and
   somewhat more positive) portrait of a Real Programmer, see
   "<a href="appa.htm#the_story_of_mel,_a_real_programmer">The_Story_of_Mel,_a_Real_Programmer</a>" in Appendix A.
   The term itself was popularized by a 1983 Datamation article
   "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" by Ed Post, still
   circulating on Usenet and Internet in on-line form.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="real_soon_now">Real Soon Now</a></h1><pre> adv.  [orig. from SF's fanzine community,
   popularized by Jerry Pournelle's column in "BYTE"] 1. Supposed
   to be available (or fixed, or cheap, or whatever) real soon now
   according to somebody, but the speaker is quite skeptical.  2. When
   one's gods, fates, or other time commitments permit one to get to
   it (in other words, don't hold your breath).  Often abbreviated
   RSN.  Compare <a href="c.htm#copious_free_time">copious_free_time</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="real_time">real time</a></h1><pre>  1. [techspeak] adj. Describes an application
   which requires a program to respond to stimuli within some small
   upper limit of response time (typically milli- or microseconds).
   Process control at a chemical plant is the classic example.  Such
   applications often require special operating systems (because
   everything else must take a back seat to response time) and
   speed-tuned hardware.  2. adv. In jargon, refers to doing something
   while people are watching or waiting.  "I asked her how to find
   the calling procedure's program counter on the stack and she came
   up with an algorithm in real time."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="real_user">real user</a></h1><pre> n.  1. A commercial user.  One who is paying
   *real* money for his computer usage.  2. A non-hacker.
   Someone using the system for an explicit purpose (a research
   project, a course, etc.)  other than pure exploration.  See
   <a href="u.htm#user">user</a>.  Hackers who are also students may also be real users.
   "I need this fixed so I can do a problem set.  I'm not complaining
   out of randomness, but as a real user."  See also <a href="l.htm#luser">luser</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="real_world">Real World</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Those institutions at which
   `programming' may be used in the same sentence as `FORTRAN',
   `<a href="c.htm#cobol">COBOL</a>', `RPG', `<a href="i.htm#ibm">IBM</a>', `DBASE', etc.  Places where
   programs do such commercially necessary but intellectually
   uninspiring things as generating payroll checks and invoices.
   2. The location of non-programmers and activities not related to
   programming.  3. A bizarre dimension in which the standard dress is
   shirt and tie and in which a person's working hours are defined as
   9 to 5 (see <a href="c.htm#code_grinder">code_grinder</a>).  4. Anywhere outside a university.
   "Poor fellow, he's left MIT and gone into the Real World."  Used
   pejoratively by those not in residence there.  In conversation,
   talking of someone who has entered the Real World is not unlike
   speaking of a deceased person.  It is also noteworthy that on the
   campus of Cambridge University in England, there is a gaily-painted
   lamp-post which bears the label `REALITY CHECKPOINT'.  It marks the
   boundary between university and the Real World; check your notions
   of reality before passing.  This joke is funnier because the
   Cambridge `campus' is actually coextensive with the center of
   Cambridge.  See also <a href="f.htm#fear_and_loathing">fear_and_loathing</a>, <a href="m.htm#mundane">mundane</a>, and

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="reality_check">reality check</a></h1><pre> n.  1. The simplest kind of test of software
   or hardware; doing the equivalent of asking it what 2 + 2 is
   and seeing if you get 4.  The software equivalent of a <a href="s.htm#smoke_test">smoke_test</a>
   .  2. The act of letting a <a href="r.htm#real_user">real_user</a> try out prototype
   software.  Compare <a href="s.htm#sanity_check">sanity_check</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="reaper">reaper</a></h1><pre> n.  A <a href="p.htm#prowler">prowler</a> that <a href="g.htm#gfr">GFR</a>s files.  A file
   removed in this way is said to have been `reaped'.

   .

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="recursive_acronym">recursive acronym</a></h1><pre>: n.  A hackish (and especially MIT)
   tradition is to choose acronyms/abbreviations that refer humorously
   to themselves or to other acronyms/abbreviations.  The classic
   examples were two MIT editors called EINE ("EINE Is Not EMACS")
   and ZWEI ("ZWEI Was EINE Initially").  More recently, there is a
   Scheme compiler called LIAR (Liar Imitates Apply Recursively), and
   <a href="g.htm#gnu">GNU</a> (q.v., sense 1) stands for "GNU's Not UNIX!" -- and a
   company with the name CYGNUS, which expands to "Cygnus, Your GNU
   Support".  See also <a href="m.htm#mung">mung</a>, <a href="e.htm#emacs">EMACS</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="red_book">Red Book</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Informal name for one of the three standard
   references on <a href="p.htm#postscript">PostScript</a> ("PostScript Language Reference
   Manual", Adobe Systems (Addison-Wesley, 1985; QA76.73.P67P67; ISBN
   0-201-10174-2, or the 1990 second edition ISBN 0-201-18127-4); the

   Interactive Programming Environment" by Adele Goldberg
   (Addison-Wesley, 1984; QA76.8.S635G638; ISBN 0-201-11372-4); this
   too is associated with blue and green books).  3. Any of the 1984
   standards issued by the CCITT eighth plenary assembly.  These
   include, among other things, the X.400 email spec and the Group 1
   through 4 fax standards.  4. The new version of the <a href="g.htm#green_book">Green_Book</a>
   (sense 4) -- IEEE 1003.1-1990, a.k.a ISO 9945-1 -- is (because of
   the color and the fact that it is printed on A4 paper) known in the
   U.S.A. as "the Ugly Red Book That Won't Fit On The Shelf" and in
   Europe as "the Ugly Red Book That's A Sensible Size".  5. The NSA

<h1><a name="regexp">regexp</a></h1><pre> /reg'eksp/ n.  [UNIX] (alt. `regex' or `reg-ex')
   1. Common written and spoken abbreviation for `regular
   expression', one of the wildcard patterns used, e.g., by UNIX
   utilities such as `grep(1)', `sed(1)', and `awk(1)'.

<h1><a name="register_dancing">register dancing</a></h1><pre> n.  Many older processor architectures
   suffer from a serious shortage of general-purpose registers.  This
   is especially a problem for compiler-writers, because their
   generated code needs places to store temporaries for things like
   intermediate values in expression evaluation.  Some designs with
   this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do have a handful of
   special-purpose registers that can be pressed into service,
   providing suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side effects
   on the state of the processor: while the special-purpose register
   is being used to hold an intermediate value, a delicate minuet is
   required in which the previous value of the register is saved and
   then restored just before the official function (and value) of the
   special-purpose register is again needed.

   would recite the phrase "It is 11:08; ABS, ALPHABETIC, ARCSIN,
   ARCCOS, ARCTAN."  The last five words were the first five

<h1><a name="retcon">retcon</a></h1><pre> /ret'kon/  [short for `retroactive continuity',
   from the Usenet newsgroup rec.arts.comics] 1. n. The common
   situation in pulp fiction (esp. comics or soap operas) where a
   new story `reveals' things about events in previous stories,
   usually leaving the `facts' the same (thus preserving
   continuity) while completely changing their interpretation.  For
   example, revealing that a whole season of "Dallas" was a
   dream was a retcon.  2. vt. To write such a story about a character
   or fictitious object.  "Byrne has retconned Superman's cape so
   that it is no longer unbreakable."  "Marvelman's old adventures
   were retconned into synthetic dreams."  "Swamp Thing was
   retconned from a transformed person into a sentient vegetable."
   "Darth Vader was retconned into Luke Skywalker's father in
   "The Empire Strikes Back".

   [This term is included because it is a good example of hackish
   linguistic innovation in a field completely unrelated to computers.
   The word `retcon' will probably spread through comics fandom and
   lose its association with hackerdom within a couple of years; for
   the record, it started here. -- ESR]

<h1><a name="rfc">RFC</a></h1><pre> /R-F-C/ n.  [Request For Comment] One of a
   long-established series of numbered Internet informational
   documents and standards widely followed by commercial software and
   freeware in the Internet and UNIX communities.  Perhaps the single
   most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet mail-format
   standard).  The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by
   technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by
   the Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an
   institution such as ANSI.  For this reason, they remain known as
   RFCs even once adopted as standards.

   The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact
   standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has
   important advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process
   typical of ANSI or ISO.  Emblematic of some of these advantages is
   the existence of a flourishing tradition of `joke' RFCs; usually
   at least one a year is published, usually on April 1st.  Well-known
   joke RFCs have included 527 ("ARPAWOCKY", R. Merryman, UCSD; 22
   June 1973), 748 ("Telnet Randomly-Lose Option", Mark R. Crispin;
   1 April 1978), and 1149 ("A Standard for the Transmission of IP
   Datagrams on Avian Carriers", D. Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April
   1990).  The first was a Lewis Carroll pastiche; the second a parody
   of the TCP-IP documentation style, and the third a deadpan
   skewering of standards-document legalese, describing protocols for
   transmitting Internet data packets by carrier pigeon.

   The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work -- they manage
   to have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in informal
   specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that
   often haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has
   grown to truly worldwide proportions.

   oath can only be used when the problem area (e.g., a language or
   operating system interface) has actually been codified in a

   documents (and the technically inappropriate but politically
   mandated compromises that they inevitably contain, and the
   impenetrable <a href="l.htm#legalese">legalese</a> in which they are invariably written,
   and the unbelievably tedious bureaucratic process by which they are

   this casual attitude towards specifications becomes unworkable when
   a system becomes popular in the <a href="r.htm#real_world">Real_World</a>.)  Since a hacker
   is likely to feel that a standards document is both unnecessary and
