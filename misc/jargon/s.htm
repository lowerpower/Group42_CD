<h1><a name="s/n_ratio">S/N ratio</a></h1><pre> // n.  (also `s/n ratio', `s:n ratio').
   Syn.  <a href="s.htm#signal-to-noise_ratio">signal-to-noise_ratio</a>.  Often abbreviated `SNR'.

<h1><a name="sacred">sacred</a></h1><pre> adj.  Reserved for the exclusive use of something (an
   extension of the standard meaning).  Often means that anyone may
   look at the sacred object, but clobbering it will screw whatever it
   is sacred to.  The comment "Register 7 is sacred to the interrupt
   handler" appearing in a program would be interpreted by a hacker
   to mean that if any *other* part of the program changes the
   contents of register 7, dire consequences are likely to ensue.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="saga">saga</a></h1><pre> n.  [WPI] A cuspy but bogus raving story about N
   random broken people.

   Here is a classic example of the saga form, as told by Guy L.
   Steele:

     Jon L. White (login name JONL) and I (GLS) were office mates at
     MIT for many years.  One April, we both flew from Boston to
     California for a week on research business, to consult
     face-to-face with some people at Stanford, particularly our
     mutual friend Richard P.  Gabriel (RPG; see <a href="g.htm#gabriel">gabriel</a>).

     RPG picked us up at the San Francisco airport and drove us back
     to Palo Alto (going <a href="l.htm#logical">logical</a> south on route 101, parallel to <a href="e.htm#el_camino_bignum">El_Camino_Bignum</a>
   ).  Palo Alto is adjacent to Stanford University
     and about 40 miles south of San Francisco.  We ate at The Good
     Earth, a `health food' restaurant, very popular, the sort whose
     milkshakes all contain honey and protein powder.  JONL ordered
     such a shake -- the waitress claimed the flavor of the day was
     "lalaberry".  I still have no idea what that might be, but it
     became a running joke.  It was the color of raspberry, and JONL
     said it tasted rather bitter.  I ate a better tostada there than
     I have ever had in a Mexican restaurant.

     After this we went to the local Uncle Gaylord's Old Fashioned Ice
     Cream Parlor.  They make ice cream fresh daily, in a variety of
     intriguing flavors.  It's a chain, and they have a slogan: "If
     you don't live near an Uncle Gaylord's -- MOVE!"  Also, Uncle
     Gaylord (a real person) wages a constant battle to force big-name
     ice cream makers to print their ingredients on the package (like
     air and plastic and other non-natural garbage).  JONL and I had
     first discovered Uncle Gaylord's the previous August, when we had
     flown to a computer-science conference in Berkeley, California,
     the first time either of us had been on the West Coast.  When not
     in the conference sessions, we had spent our time wandering the
     length of Telegraph Avenue, which (like Harvard Square in
     Cambridge) was lined with picturesque street vendors and
     interesting little shops.  On that street we discovered Uncle
     Gaylord's Berkeley store.  The ice cream there was very good.
     During that August visit JONL went absolutely bananas (so to
     speak) over one particular flavor, ginger honey.

     Therefore, after eating at The Good Earth -- indeed, after every
     lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit -- a trip
     to Uncle Gaylord's (the one in Palo Alto) was mandatory.  We had
     arrived on a Wednesday, and by Thursday evening we had been there
     at least four times.  Each time, JONL would get ginger honey ice
     cream, and proclaim to all bystanders that "Ginger was the spice
     that drove the Europeans mad!  That's why they sought a route to
     the East!  They used it to preserve their otherwise off-taste
     meat."  After the third or fourth repetition RPG and I were
     getting a little tired of this spiel, and began to paraphrase
     him: "Wow!  Ginger!  The spice that makes rotten meat taste
     good!"  "Say!  Why don't we find some dog that's been run over
     and sat in the sun for a week and put some *ginger* on it for
     dinner?!"  "Right!  With a lalaberry shake!"  And so on.  This
     failed to faze JONL; he took it in good humor, as long as we kept
     returning to Uncle Gaylord's.  He loves ginger honey ice cream.

     Now RPG and his then-wife KBT (Kathy Tracy) were putting us up
     (putting up with us?) in their home for our visit, so to thank them
     JONL and I took them out to a nice French restaurant of their
     choosing.  I unadventurously chose the filet mignon, and KBT had
     je ne sais quoi du jour, but RPG and JONL had lapin
     (rabbit).  (Waitress: "Oui, we have fresh rabbit, fresh
     today."  RPG: "Well, JONL, I guess we won't need any
     *ginger*!")

     We finished the meal late, about 11 P.M., which is 2 A.M Boston
     time, so JONL and I were rather droopy.  But it wasn't yet
     midnight.  Off to Uncle Gaylord's!

     Now the French restaurant was in Redwood City, north of Palo
     Alto.  In leaving Redwood City, we somehow got onto route 101
     going north instead of south.  JONL and I wouldn't have known the
     difference had RPG not mentioned it.  We still knew very little
     of the local geography.  I did figure out, however, that we were
     headed in the direction of Berkeley, and half-jokingly suggested
     that we continue north and go to Uncle Gaylord's in Berkeley.

     RPG said "Fine!" and we drove on for a while and talked.  I was
     drowsy, and JONL actually dropped off to sleep for 5 minutes.
     When he awoke, RPG said, "Gee, JONL, you must have slept all the
     way over the bridge!", referring to the one spanning San
     Francisco Bay.  Just then we came to a sign that said "University
     Avenue".  I mumbled something about working our way over to
     Telegraph Avenue; RPG said "Right!" and maneuvered some more.
     Eventually we pulled up in front of an Uncle Gaylord's.

     Now, I hadn't really been paying attention because I was so
     sleepy, and I didn't really understand what was happening until
     RPG let me in on it a few moments later, but I was just alert
     enough to notice that we had somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle
     Gaylord's after all.

     JONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store, but hadn't
     caught on.  (The place is lit with red and yellow lights at
     night, and looks much different from the way it does in
     daylight.)  He said, "This isn't the Uncle Gaylord's I went to in
     Berkeley!  It looked like a barn!  But this place looks *just
     like* the one back in Palo Alto!"

     RPG deadpanned, "Well, this is the one *I* always come to when
     I'm in Berkeley.  They've got two in San Francisco, too.
     Remember, they're a chain."

     JONL accepted this bit of wisdom.  And he was not totally ignorant
     --- he knew perfectly well that University Avenue was in Berkeley,
     not far from Telegraph Avenue.  What he didn't know was that
     there is a completely different University Avenue in Palo Alto.

     JONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger honey.  The guy
     at the counter asked whether JONL would like to taste it first,
     evidently their standard procedure with that flavor, as not too
     many people like it.

     JONL said, "I'm sure I like it.  Just give me a cone."  The guy
     behind the counter insisted that JONL try just a taste first.
     "Some people think it tastes like soap."  JONL insisted, "Look, I
     *love* ginger.  I eat Chinese food.  I eat raw ginger roots.  I
     already went through this hassle with the guy back in Palo Alto.
     I *know* I like that flavor!"

     At the words "back in Palo Alto" the guy behind the counter got a
     very strange look on his face, but said nothing.  KBT caught his
     eye and winked.  Through my stupor I still hadn't quite grasped
     what was going on, and thought RPG was rolling on the floor
     laughing and clutching his stomach just because JONL had launched
     into his spiel ("makes rotten meat a dish for princes") for the
     forty-third time.  At this point, RPG clued me in fully.

     RPG, KBT, and I retreated to a table, trying to stifle our
     chuckles.  JONL remained at the counter, talking about ice cream
     with the guy b.t.c., comparing Uncle Gaylord's to other ice cream
     shops and generally having a good old time.

     At length the g.b.t.c. said, "How's the ginger honey?"  JONL
     said, "Fine!  I wonder what exactly is in it?"  Now Uncle Gaylord
     publishes all his recipes and even teaches classes on how to make
     his ice cream at home.  So the g.b.t.c. got out the recipe, and
     he and JONL pored over it for a while.  But the g.b.t.c. could
     contain his curiosity no longer, and asked again, "You really
     like that stuff, huh?"  JONL said, "Yeah, I've been eating it
     constantly back in Palo Alto for the past two days.  In fact, I
     think this batch is about as good as the cones I got back in Palo
     Alto!"

     G.b.t.c. looked him straight in the eye and said, "You're
     *in* Palo Alto!"

     JONL turned slowly around, and saw the three of us collapse in a
     fit of giggles.  He clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed,
     "I've been hacked!"

   relative of the raspberry found out there called an `ollalieberry'
   -- ESR]

   [Ironic footnote: it appears that the <a href="m.htm#meme">meme</a> about ginger vs.
   rotting meat may be an urban legend.  It's not borne out by an
   examination of medieval recipes or period purchase records for
   spices, and appears full-blown in the works of Samuel Pegge, a
   gourmand and notorious flake case who originated numerous food
   myths. -- ESR]

<h1><a name="sagan">sagan</a></h1><pre> /say'gn/ n.  [from Carl Sagan's TV series
   "Cosmos"; think "billions and billions"] A large quantity
   of anything.  "There's a sagan different ways to tweak EMACS."
   "The U.S. Government spends sagans on bombs and welfare -- hard
   to say which is more destructive."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="sail">SAIL</a></h1><pre>: /sayl/, not /S-A-I-L/ n.  1. The Stanford
   Artificial Intelligence Lab.  An important site in the early
   development of LISP; with the MIT AI Lab, BBN, CMU, XEROX PARC, and
   the UNIX community, one of the major wellsprings of technical
   innovation and hacker-culture traditions (see the <a href="w.htm#waits">WAITS</a> entry
   for details).  The SAIL machines were shut down in late May 1990,
   scant weeks after the MIT AI Lab's ITS cluster was officially
   decommissioned.  2. The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language
   used at SAIL (sense 1).  It was an Algol-60 derivative with a
   coroutining facility and some new data types intended for building
   search trees and association lists.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="salescritter">salescritter</a></h1><pre> /sayls'kri`tr/ n.  Pejorative hackerism for a
   computer salesperson.  Hackers tell the following joke:

     Q. What's the difference between a used-car dealer and a
        computer salesman?
     A. The used-car dealer knows he's lying.  [Some versions add:
        ...and probably knows how to drive.]

   This reflects the widespread hacker belief that salescritters are
   self-selected for stupidity (after all, if they had brains and the
   inclination to use them, they'd be in programming).  The terms
   `salesthing' and `salesdroid' are also common.  Compare
   <a href="m.htm#marketroid">marketroid</a>, <a href="s.htm#suit">suit</a>, <a href="d.htm#droid">droid</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="salt">salt</a></h1><pre> n.  A tiny bit of near-random data inserted where too
   much regularity would be undesirable; a data <a href="f.htm#frob">frob</a> (sense 1).
   For example, the Unix crypt(3) man page mentions that "the salt
   string is used to perturb the DES algorithm in one of 4096
   different ways."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="salt_mines">salt mines</a></h1><pre> n.  Dense quarters housing large numbers of
   programmers working long hours on grungy projects, with some hope
   of seeing the end of the tunnel in N years.  Noted for their
   absence of sunshine.  Compare <a href="p.htm#playpen">playpen</a>, <a href="s.htm#sandbox">sandbox</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="salt_substrate">salt substrate</a></h1><pre> n.  [MIT] Collective noun used to refer to potato
   chips, pretzels, saltines, or any other form of snack food designed
   primarily as a carrier for sodium chloride.  From the technical
   term `chip substrate', used to refer to the silicon on the top
   of which the active parts of integrated circuits are deposited.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="same-day_service">same-day service</a></h1><pre> n.  Ironic term used to describe long
   response time, particularly with respect to <a href="m.htm#ms-dos">MS-DOS</a> system
   calls (which ought to require only a tiny fraction of a second to
   execute).  Such response time is a major incentive for programmers
   to write programs that are not <a href="w.htm#well-behaved">well-behaved</a>.  See also
   <a href="p.htm#pc-ism">PC-ism</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="samizdat">samizdat</a></h1><pre> n.  [Russian, literally "self publishing"] The
   process of disseminating documentation via underground channels.
   Originally referred to photocopy duplication and distribution of
   banned books in the former Soviet Union; now refers by obvious
   extension to any less-than-official promulgation of textual
   material, esp. rare, obsolete, or never-formally-published computer
   documentation.  Samizdat is obviously much easier when one has
   access to high-bandwidth networks and high-quality laser printers.
   Note that samizdat is properly used only with respect to documents
   which contain needed information (see also <a href="h.htm#hacker_ethic,_the">hacker_ethic,_the</a>)
   but which are for some reason otherwise unavailable, but *not*
   in the context of documents which are available through normal
   channels, for which unauthorized duplication would be unethical
   copyright violation.  See <a href="l.htm#lions_book">Lions_Book</a> for a historical example.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="samurai">samurai</a></h1><pre> n.  A hacker who hires out for legal cracking jobs,
   snooping for factions in corporate political fights, lawyers
   pursuing privacy-rights and First Amendment cases, and other
   parties with legitimate reasons to need an electronic locksmith.
   In 1991, mainstream media reported the existence of a loose-knit
   culture of samurai that meets electronically on BBS systems, mostly
   bright teenagers with personal micros; they have modeled themselves
   explicitly on the historical samurai of Japan and on the "net
   cowboys" of William Gibson's <a href="appc.htm#cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> novels.  Those
   interviewed claim to adhere to a rigid ethic of loyalty to their
   employers and to disdain the vandalism and theft practiced by
   criminal crackers as beneath them and contrary to the hacker ethic;
   some quote Miyamoto Musashi's "Book of Five Rings", a classic
   of historical samurai doctrine, in support of these principles.

   the physical design of chips.  Compare <a href="i.htm#ironmonger">ironmonger</a>, <a href="p.htm#polygon_pusher">polygon_pusher</a>
   .

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="sandbox">sandbox</a></h1><pre> n.  1. (also `sandbox, the') Common term for the R&D
   department at many software and computer companies (where hackers
   in commercial environments are likely to be found).  Half-derisive,
   but reflects the truth that research is a form of creative play.
   Compare <a href="p.htm#playpen">playpen</a>.  2. Syn. <a href="l.htm#link_farm">link_farm</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="sanity_check">sanity check</a></h1><pre> n.  1. The act of checking a piece of code (or
   anything else, e.g., a Usenet posting) for completely stupid
   mistakes.  Implies that the check is to make sure the author was
   sane when it was written; e.g., if a piece of scientific software
   relied on a particular formula and was giving unexpected results,
   one might first look at the nesting of parentheses or the coding of
   the formula, as a `sanity check', before looking at the more
   complex I/O or data structure manipulation routines, much less the
   algorithm itself.  Compare <a href="r.htm#reality_check">reality_check</a>.  2. A run-time test,
   either validating input or ensuring that the program hasn't screwed
   up internally (producing an inconsistent value or state).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="saturday-night_special">Saturday-night special</a></h1><pre> n.  [from police slang for a cheap
   handgun] A <a href="q.htm#quick-and-dirty">quick-and-dirty</a> program or feature kluged together
   during off hours, under a deadline, and in response to pressure
   from a <a href="s.htm#salescritter">salescritter</a>.  Such hacks are dangerously unreliable,
   but all too often sneak into a production release after
   insufficient review.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="say">say</a></h1><pre> vt.  1. To type to a terminal.  "To list a directory
   verbosely, you have to say `ls -l'."  Tends to imply a
   <a href="n.htm#newline">newline</a>-terminated command (a `sentence').  2. A computer
   may also be said to `say' things to you, even if it doesn't have
   a speech synthesizer, by displaying them on a terminal in response
   to your commands.  Hackers find it odd that this usage confuses
   <a href="m.htm#mundane">mundane</a>s.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="scag">scag</a></h1><pre> vt.  To destroy the data on a disk, either by
   corrupting the
  filesystem or by causing media damage.  "That last power hit scagged
  the system disk."  Compare <a href="s.htm#scrog">scrog</a>, <a href="r.htm#roach">roach</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="schroedinbug">schroedinbug</a></h1><pre> /shroh'din-buhg/ n.  [MIT: from the
   Schroedinger's Cat thought-experiment in quantum physics] A design
   or implementation bug in a program that doesn't manifest until
   someone reading source or using the program in an unusual way
   notices that it never should have worked, at which point the
   program promptly stops working for everybody until fixed.  Though
   (like <a href="b.htm#bit_rot">bit_rot</a>) this sounds impossible, it happens; some
   programs have harbored latent schroedinbugs for years.  Compare

<h1><a name="science-fiction_fandom">science-fiction fandom</a></h1><pre>: n.  Another voluntary subculture
   having a very heavy overlap with hackerdom; most hackers read SF
   and/or fantasy fiction avidly, and many go to `cons' (SF
   conventions) or are involved in fandom-connected activities such as
   the Society for Creative Anachronism.  Some hacker jargon
   originated in SF fandom; see <a href="d.htm#defenestration">defenestration</a>, <a href="g.htm#great-wall">great-wall</a>,

<h1><a name="scram_switch">scram switch</a></h1><pre> n.  [from the nuclear power industry] An
   emergency-power-off switch (see <a href="b.htm#big_red_switch">Big_Red_Switch</a>), esp. one
   positioned to be easily hit by evacuating personnel.  In general,
   this is *not* something you <a href="f.htm#frob">frob</a> lightly; these often

<h1><a name="scratch">scratch</a></h1><pre>  1. [from `scratchpad'] adj. Describes a data
   structure or recording medium attached to a machine for testing or
   temporary-use purposes; one that can be <a href="s.htm#scribble">scribble</a>d on without
   loss.  Usually in the combining forms `scratch memory',
   `scratch register', `scratch disk', `scratch tape',
   `scratch volume'.  See also <a href="s.htm#scratch_monkey">scratch_monkey</a>.  2. [primarily
   IBM] vt. To delete (as in a file).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="scratch_monkey">scratch monkey</a></h1><pre> n.  As in "Before testing or reconfiguring,
   always mount a <a href="s.htm#scratch_monkey">scratch_monkey</a>", a proverb used to advise
   caution when dealing with irreplaceable data or devices.  Used to
   refer to any scratch volume hooked to a computer during any risky
   operation as a replacement for some precious resource or data that
   might otherwise get trashed.

   This term preserves the memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder
   Monkey, star of a biological research program at the University of
   Toronto.  Mabel was not (so the legend goes) your ordinary monkey;
   the university had spent years teaching her how to swim, breathing
   through a regulator, in order to study the effects of different gas
   mixtures on her physiology.  Mabel suffered an untimely demise one
   day when a DEC engineer troubleshooting a crash on the program's
   VAX inadvertently interfered with some custom hardware that was
   wired to Mabel.

   It is reported that, after calming down an understandably irate
   customer sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the matter, a DEC
   troubleshooter called up the <a href="f.htm#field_circus">field_circus</a> manager responsible
   and asked him sweetly, "Can you swim?"

   Not all the consequences to humans were so amusing; the sysop of
   the machine in question was nearly thrown in jail at the behest of
   certain clueless droids at the local `humane' society.  The moral
   is clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey.

   [The actual incident occured in 1979 or 1980. There is a version of
   this story, complete with reported dialogue between one of the
   project people and DEC field service, that has been circulating on
   Internet since 1986.  It is hilarious and mythic, but gets some
   facts wrong.  For example, it reports the machine as a PDP-11 and
   alleges that Mabel's demise occurred when DEC <a href="p.htm#pm">PM</a>ed the
   machine.  Earlier versions of this entry were based on that story;
   this one has been corrected from an interview with the hapless

<h1><a name="scream_and_die">scream and die</a></h1><pre> v.  Syn. <a href="c.htm#cough_and_die">cough_and_die</a>, but connotes
   that an error message was printed or displayed before the program
   crashed.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="screaming_tty">screaming tty</a></h1><pre> n.  [UNIX] A terminal line which spews an infinite
   number of random characters at the operating system.  This can
   happen if the terminal is either disconnected or connected to a
   powered-off terminal but still enabled for login; misconfiguration,
   misimplementation, or simple bad luck can start such a terminal
   screaming.  A screaming tty or two can seriously degrade the
   performance of a vanilla UNIX system; the arriving "characters"
   are treated as userid/password pairs and tested as such.  The UNIX
   password encryption algorithm is designed to be computationally
   intensive in order to foil brute-force crack attacks, so although
   none of the logins succeeds; the overhead of rejecting them all can
   be substantial.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="screw">screw</a></h1><pre> n.  [MIT] A <a href="l.htm#lose">lose</a>, usually in software.
   Especially used for user-visible misbehavior caused by a bug or
   misfeature.  This use has become quite widespread outside MIT.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="screwage">screwage</a></h1><pre> /skroo'*j/ n.  Like <a href="l.htm#lossage">lossage</a> but connotes
   that the failure is due to a designed-in misfeature rather than a
   simple inadequacy or a mere bug.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="scribble">scribble</a></h1><pre> n.  To modify a data structure in a random and
   unintentionally destructive way.  "Bletch! Somebody's
   disk-compactor program went berserk and scribbled on the i-node
   table."  "It was working fine until one of the allocation
   routines scribbled on low core."  Synonymous with <a href="t.htm#trash">trash</a>;
   compare <a href="m.htm#mung">mung</a>, which conveys a bit more intention, and
   <a href="m.htm#mangle">mangle</a>, which is more violent and final.

<h1><a name="scrog">scrog</a></h1><pre> /skrog/ vt.  [Bell Labs] To damage, trash, or
   corrupt a data structure.  "The list header got scrogged."  Also
   reported as `skrog', and ascribed to the comic strip "The
   Wizard of Id".  Compare <a href="s.htm#scag">scag</a>; possibly the two are related.
   Equivalent to <a href="s.htm#scribble">scribble</a> or <a href="m.htm#mangle">mangle</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="scrool">scrool</a></h1><pre> /skrool/ n.  [from the pioneering Roundtable chat
   system in Houston ca. 1984; prob. originated as a typo for
   `scroll'] The log of old messages, available for later perusal or
   to help one get back in synch with the conversation.  It was
   originally called the `scrool monster', because an early version
   of the roundtable software had a bug where it would dump all 8K of
   scrool on a user's terminal.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="scrozzle">scrozzle</a></h1><pre> /skroz'l/ vt.  Used when a self-modifying code

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="scsi">SCSI</a></h1><pre> n.  [Small Computer System Interface] A bus-independent
   standard for system-level interfacing between a computer and
   intelligent devices.  Typically annotated in literature with
   `sexy' (/sek'see/), `sissy' (/sis'ee/), and `scuzzy'
   (/skuh'zee/) as pronunciation guides -- the last being the
   overwhelmingly predominant form, much to the dismay of the
   designers and their marketing people.  One can usually assume that
   a person who pronounces it /S-C-S-I/ is clueless.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="scumos">ScumOS</a></h1><pre> /skuhm'os/ or /skuhm'O-S/ n.  Unflattering
   hackerism for SunOS, the UNIX variant supported on Sun
   Microsystems's UNIX workstations (see also <a href="s.htm#sun-stools">sun-stools</a>), and
   compare <a href="a.htm#aidx">AIDX</a>, <a href="m.htm#macintrash">Macintrash</a>, <a href="n.htm#nominal_semidestructor">Nominal_Semidestructor</a>,

   suggest, Sun was founded by hackers and still enjoys excellent
   relations with hackerdom; usage is more often in exasperation than
   outright loathing.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="search-and-destroy_mode">search-and-destroy mode</a></h1><pre> n.  Hackerism for a noninteractive
   search-and-replace facility in an editor, so called because an
   incautiously chosen match pattern can cause <a href="i.htm#infinite">infinite</a> damage.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="second-system_effect">second-system effect</a></h1><pre> n.  (sometimes, more euphoniously,
   `second-system syndrome') When one is designing the successor to
   a relatively small, elegant, and successful system, there is a
   tendency to become grandiose in one's success and design an
   <a href="e.htm#elephantine">elephantine</a> feature-laden monstrosity.  The term was first
   used by Fred Brooks in his classic "The Mythical Man-Month:
   Essays on Software Engineering" (Addison-Wesley, 1975; ISBN
   0-201-00650-2).  It described the jump from a set of nice, simple
   operating systems on the IBM 70xx series to OS/360 on the 360
   series.  A similar effect can also happen in an evolving system;
   see <a href="b.htm#brooks's_law">Brooks's_Law</a>, <a href="c.htm#creeping_elegance">creeping_elegance</a>, <a href="c.htm#creeping_featurism">creeping_featurism</a>

   .

   This version of the jargon lexicon has been described (with
   altogether too much truth for comfort) as an example of
   second-system effect run amok on jargon-1....

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="secondary_damage">secondary damage</a></h1><pre> n.  When a fatal error occurs (esp. a
   <a href="s.htm#segfault">segfault</a>) the immediate cause may be that a pointer has been
   trashed due to a previous <a href="f.htm#fandango_on_core">fandango_on_core</a>.  However, this
   fandango may have been due to an *earlier* fandango, so no
   amount of analysis will reveal (directly) how the damage occurred.
   "The data structure was clobbered, but it was secondary
   damage."

   By extension, the corruption resulting from N cascaded
   fandangoes on core is `Nth-level damage'.  There is at least
   one case on record in which 17 hours of <a href="g.htm#grovel">grovel</a>ling with
   `adb' actually dug up the underlying bug behind an instance of
   seventh-level damage!  The hacker who accomplished this
   near-superhuman feat was presented with an award by his fellows.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="security_through_obscurity">security through obscurity</a></h1><pre>  (alt. `security by obscurity')
   A term applied by hackers to most OS vendors' favorite way of
   coping with security holes -- namely, ignoring them, documenting
   neither any known holes nor the underlying security algorithms,
   trusting that nobody will find out about them and that people who
   do find out about them won't exploit them.  This "strategy" never
   works for long and occasionally sets the world up for debacles like
   the <a href="r.htm#rtm">RTM</a> worm of 1988 (see <a href="g.htm#great_worm,_the">Great_Worm,_the</a>), but once the
   brief moments of panic created by such events subside most vendors
   are all too willing to turn over and go back to sleep.  After all,
   actually fixing the bugs would siphon off the resources needed to
   implement the next user-interface frill on marketing's wish list
   -- and besides, if they started fixing security bugs customers
   might begin to *expect* it and imagine that their warranties
   of merchantability gave them some sort of *right* to a system
   with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and
   *then* where would we be?

   Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of
   this term.  It has been claimed that it was first used in the
   Usenet newsgroup in comp.sys.apollo during a campaign to get
   HP/Apollo to fix security problems in its UNIX-<a href="c.htm#clone">clone</a>
   Aegis/DomainOS (they didn't change a thing).  <a href="i.htm#its">ITS</a> fans, on the
   other hand, say it was coined years earlier in opposition to the
   incredibly paranoid <a href="m.htm#multics">Multics</a> people down the hall, for whom
   security was everything.  In the ITS culture it referred to (1) the
   fact that by the time a tourist figured out how to make
   trouble he'd generally gotten over the urge to make it, because he
   felt part of the community; and (2) (self-mockingly) the poor
   coverage of the documentation and obscurity of many commands.  One
   instance of *deliberate* security through obscurity is
   recorded; the command to allow patching the running ITS system
   (<a href="a.htm#altmode">altmode</a> altmode control-R) echoed as $$^D.  If you actually
   typed alt alt ^D, that set a flag that would prevent patching the
   system even if you later got it right.

<h1><a name="segment">segment</a></h1><pre> /seg'ment/ vi.  To experience a <a href="s.htm#segmentation_fault">segmentation_fault</a>
   .  Confusingly, this is often pronounced more like the noun
   `segment' than like mainstream v. segment; this is because it is
   actually a noun shorthand that has been verbed.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="segmentation_fault">segmentation fault</a></h1><pre> n.  [UNIX] 1. An error in which a running
   program attempts to access memory not allocated to it and <a href="c.htm#core_dump">core_dump</a>

   thought or a line of reasoning.  Also uttered as an exclamation at
   the point of befuddlement.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="segv">segv</a></h1><pre> /seg'vee/ n.,vi.  Yet another synonym for

   Internet, which is rife with `name servers', `domain servers',
   `news servers', `finger servers', and the like.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="sex">SEX</a></h1><pre> /seks/  [Sun Users' Group & elsewhere] n. 1. Software
   EXchange.  A technique invented by the blue-green algae hundreds of
   millions of years ago to speed up their evolution, which had been
   terribly slow up until then.  Today, SEX parties are popular among
   hackers and others (of course, these are no longer limited to
   exchanges of genetic software).  In general, SEX parties are a
   <a href="g.htm#good_thing">Good_Thing</a>, but unprotected SEX can propagate a <a href="v.htm#virus">virus</a>.
   See also <a href="p.htm#pubic_directory">pubic_directory</a>.  2. The rather Freudian mnemonic
   often used for Sign EXtend, a machine instruction found in the
   PDP-11 and many other architectures.  The RCA 1802 chip used in the
   early Elf and SuperElf personal computers had a `SEt X register'
   SEX instruction, but this seems to have had little folkloric
   impact.

   DEC's engineers nearly got a PDP-11 assembler that used the
   `SEX' mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for once)
   marketing wasn't asleep and forced a change.  That wasn't the last
   time this happened, either.  The author of "The Intel 8086
   Primer", who was one of the original designers of the 8086, noted
   that there was originally a `SEX' instruction on that
   processor, too.  He says that Intel management got cold feet and
   decreed that it be changed, and thus the instruction was renamed
   `CBW' and `CWD' (depending on what was being extended).
   Amusingly, the Intel 8048 (the microcontroller used in IBM PC
   keyboards) is also missing straight `SEX' but has logical-or
   and logical-and instructions `ORL' and `ANL'.

   The Motorola 6809, used in the U.K.'s `Dragon 32' personal
   computer, actually had an official `SEX' instruction; the 6502
   in the Apple II with which it competed did not.  British hackers
   thought this made perfect mythic sense; after all, it was commonly
   observed, you could (on some theoretical level) have sex with a
   dragon, but you can't have sex with an apple.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="sharchive">sharchive</a></h1><pre> /shar'ki:v/ n.  [UNIX and Usenet; from /bin/sh
   archive] A <a href="f.htm#flatten">flatten</a>ed representation of a set of one or more
   files, with the unique property that it can be unflattened (the
   original files restored) by feeding it through a standard UNIX
   shell; thus, a sharchive can be distributed to anyone running UNIX,
   and no special unpacking software is required.  Sharchives are also
   intriguing in that they are typically created by shell scripts; the
   script that produces sharchives is thus a script which produces
   self-unpacking scripts, which may themselves contain scripts.  (The
   downsides of sharchives are that they are an ideal venue for
   <a href="t.htm#trojan_horse">Trojan_horse</a> attacks and that, for recipients not running
   UNIX, no simple un-sharchiving program is possible; sharchives can
   and do make use of arbitrarily-powerful shell features.)
   Sharchives are also commonly referred to as `shar files' after the
   name of the most common program for generating them.

   indicates allegiance to the hacker ethic of free information
   sharing (see <a href="h.htm#hacker_ethic,_the">hacker_ethic,_the</a>, sense 1).  2. The motto of the
   Sirius Cybernetics Corporation (the ultimate gaggle of incompetent

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="shell">shell</a></h1><pre> [orig. <a href="m.htm#multics">Multics</a> n.  techspeak, widely propagated
   via UNIX] 1. [techspeak] The command interpreter used to pass
   commands to an operating system; so called because it is the part
   of the operating system that interfaces with the outside world.
   2. More generally, any interface program that mediates access to a
   special resource or <a href="s.htm#server">server</a> for convenience, efficiency, or
   security reasons; for this meaning, the usage is usually `a shell
   around' whatever.  This sort of program is also called a

   Internet, Beast of a Thousand Processes, Eater of Characters,
   Avatar of Line Noise, and Imp of Call Waiting; the hideous
   multi-tendriled entity formed of all the manifold connections of
   the net.  A sect of MUDders worships Shub-Internet, sacrificing
   objects and praying for good connections.  To no avail -- its
   purpose is malign and evil, and is the cause of all network
   slowdown.  Often heard as in "Freela casts a tac nuke at
   Shub-Internet for slowing her down."  (A forged response often
   follows along the lines of: "Shub-Internet gulps down the tac nuke
   and burps happily.")  Also cursed by users of <a href="f.htm#ftp">FTP</a> and
   <a href="t.htm#telnet">TELNET</a> when the system slows down.  The dread name of

   .  There was a <a href="m.htm#meme_plague">meme_plague</a> or fad for these on Usenet in
   late 1991.  Most were equivalents of "I am a .sig virus.  Please
   reproduce me in your .sig block.".  Of course, the .sig virus's
   memetic hook is the giggle value of going along with the gag; this,
   however, was a self-limiting phenomenon as more and more people
   picked up on the idea.  There were creative variants on it; some
   people stuck `sig virus antibody' texts in their sigs, and there
   was at least one instance of a sig virus eater.

<h1><a name="signal-to-noise_ratio">signal-to-noise ratio</a></h1><pre> [from analog electronics] n.  Used by
   hackers in a generalization of its technical meaning.  `Signal'
   refers to useful information conveyed by some communications
   medium, and `noise' to anything else on that medium.  Hence a low
   ratio implies that it is not worth paying attention to the medium
   in question.  Figures for such metaphorical ratios are never given.
   The term is most often applied to <a href="u.htm#usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroups during

<h1><a name="silo">silo</a></h1><pre> n.  The FIFO input-character buffer in an RS-232 line
   card.  So called from DEC terminology used on DH and DZ line cards
   for the VAX and PDP-11, presumably because it was a storage space
   for fungible stuff that went in at the top and came out at the
   bottom.

<h1><a name="sitename">sitename</a></h1><pre> /si:t'naym/ n.  [UNIX/Internet] The unique
   electronic name of a computer system, used to identify it in UUCP
   mail, Usenet, or other forms of electronic information interchange.
   The folklore interest of sitenames stems from the creativity and
   humor they often display.  Interpreting a sitename is not unlike
   interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally unpack it,
   allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack of
   whitespace.  Hacker tradition deprecates dull,
   institutional-sounding names in favor of punchy, humorous, and
   clever coinages (except that it is considered appropriate for the
   official public gateway machine of an organization to bear the
   organization's name or acronym).  Mythological references, cartoon
   characters, animal names, and allusions to SF or fantasy literature
   are probably the most popular sources for sitenames (in roughly
   descending order).  The obligatory comment when discussing these is
   Harris's Lament: "All the good ones are taken!"  See also

   device.  Apple's QuickDraw, like most other professional-level
   graphics systems, renders polygons and lines not with Bresenham's
   algorithm, but by calculating `slab points' for each scan line
   on the screen in succession, and then slabbing in the actual image
   pixels.

   of the <a href="c.htm#church_of_the_subgenius">Church_of_the_SubGenius</a>, a mystical substance or
   quality that is the prerequisite of all human happiness.

   Since UNIX files are stored compactly, except for the unavoidable

   scheduler that a process may be deactivated until some given event
   occurs or a specified time delay elapses.  2. In jargon, used very
   similarly to v. <a href="b.htm#block">block</a>; also in `sleep on', syn. with
   `block on'.  Often used to indicate that the speaker has
   relinquished a demand for resources until some (possibly
   unspecified) external event: "They can't get the fix I've been
   asking for into the next release, so I'm going to sleep on it until
   the release, then start hassling them again."

<h1><a name="slop">slop</a></h1><pre> n.  1. A one-sided <a href="f.htm#fudge_factor">fudge_factor</a>, that is, an
   allowance for error but in only one of two directions.  For
   example, if you need a piece of wire 10 feet long and have to guess
   when you cut it, you make very sure to cut it too long, by a large
   amount if necessary, rather than too short by even a little bit,
   because you can always cut off the slop but you can't paste it back
   on again.  When discrete quantities are involved, slop is often
   introduced to avoid the possibility of being on the losing side of
   a <a href="f.htm#fencepost_error">fencepost_error</a>.  2. The percentage of `extra' code
   generated by a compiler over the size of equivalent assembler code
   produced by <a href="h.htm#hand-hacking">hand-hacking</a>; i.e., the space (or maybe time) you
   lose because you didn't do it yourself.  This number is often used
   as a measure of the goodness of a compiler; slop below 5% is very
   good, and 10% is usually acceptable.  With modern compiler
   technology, esp. on RISC machines, the compiler's slop may
   actually be *negative*; that is, humans may be unable to
   generate code as good.  This is one of the reasons assembler
   programming is no longer common.

   task allowed to `suck up the slop'.  Also called a `hungry puppy'
   or `bottom feeder'.  One common variety of slopsucker hunts for

<h1><a name="smart">smart</a></h1><pre> adj.  Said of a program that does the <a href="r.htm#right_thing">Right_Thing</a>

<h1><a name="smart_terminal">smart terminal</a></h1><pre> n.  1. A terminal that has enough computing
   capability to render graphics or to offload some kind of front-end
   processing from the computer it talks to.  The development of
   workstations and personal computers has made this term and the
   product it describes semi-obsolescent, but one may still hear
   variants of the phrase `act like a smart terminal' used to
   describe the behavior of workstations or PCs with respect to
   programs that execute almost entirely out of a remote <a href="s.htm#server">server</a>'s
   storage, using said devices as displays.  2. obs. Any terminal with
   an addressable cursor; the opposite of a <a href="g.htm#glass_tty">glass_tty</a>.  Today, a
   terminal with merely an addressable cursor, but with none of the
   more-powerful features mentioned in sense 1, is called a <a href="d.htm#dumb_terminal">dumb_terminal</a>
   .

   There is a classic quote from Rob Pike (inventor of the <a href="b.htm#blit">blit</a>
   terminal): "A smart terminal is not a smart*ass* terminal,
   but rather a terminal you can educate."  This illustrates a common
   design problem: The attempt to make peripherals (or anything else)
   intelligent sometimes results in finicky, rigid `special
   features' that become just so much dead weight if you try to use
   the device in any way the designer didn't anticipate.  Flexibility
   and programmability, on the other hand, are *really* smart.

<h1><a name="smoke_and_mirrors">smoke and mirrors</a></h1><pre> n.  Marketing deceptions.  The term is
   mainstream in this general sense.  Among hackers it's strongly
   associated with bogus demos and crocked <a href="b.htm#benchmark">benchmark</a>s (see also
   <a href="m.htm#mips">MIPS</a>, <a href="m.htm#machoflops">machoflops</a>).  "They claim their new box cranks 50
   MIPS for under $5000, but didn't specify the instruction mix ---
   sounds like smoke and mirrors to me."  The phrase, popularized by
   newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin c.1975, has been said to
   derive from carnie slang for magic acts and `freak show' displays
   that depend on `trompe l'oeil' effects, but also calls to mind
   the fierce Aztec god Tezcatlipoca (lit. "Smoking Mirror") for
   whom the hearts of huge numbers of human sacrificial victims were
   regularly cut out.  Upon hearing about a rigged demo or yet another
   round of fantasy-based marketing promises, hackers often feel
   analogously disheartened.

<h1><a name="smoke_test">smoke test</a></h1><pre> n.  1. A rudimentary form of testing applied to
   electronic equipment following repair or reconfiguration, in which
   power is applied and the tester checks for sparks, smoke, or other
   dramatic signs of fundamental failure.  See <a href="m.htm#magic_smoke">magic_smoke</a>.
   2. By extension, the first run of a piece of software after
   construction or a critical change.  See and compare <a href="r.htm#reality_check">reality_check</a>
   .

   There is an interesting semi-parallel to this term among
   typographers and printers: When new typefaces are being punch-cut
   by hand, a `smoke test' (hold the letter in candle smoke, then
   press it onto paper) is used to check out new dies.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="smoking_clover">smoking clover</a></h1><pre> n.  [ITS] A <a href="d.htm#display_hack">display_hack</a> originally due
   to Bill Gosper.  Many convergent lines are drawn on a color monitor
   in <a href="a.htm#aos">AOS</a> mode (so that every pixel struck has its color
   incremented).  The lines all have one endpoint in the middle of the
   screen; the other endpoints are spaced one pixel apart around the
   perimeter of a large square.  The color map is then repeatedly
   rotated.  This results in a striking, rainbow-hued, shimmering
   four-leaf clover.  Gosper joked about keeping it hidden from the
   FDA (the U.S.'s Food and Drug Administration) lest its
   hallucinogenic properties cause it to be banned.

<h1><a name="smop">SMOP</a></h1><pre> /S-M-O-P/ n.  [Simple (or Small) Matter of
   Programming] 1. A piece of code, not yet written, whose anticipated
   length is significantly greater than its complexity.  Used to refer
   to a program that could obviously be written, but is not worth the
   trouble.  Also used ironically to imply that a difficult problem
   can be easily solved because a program can be written to do it; the
   irony is that it is very clear that writing such a program will be
   a great deal of work.  "It's easy to enhance a FORTRAN compiler to
   compile COBOL as well; it's just an SMOP."  2. Often used
   ironically by the intended victim when a suggestion for a program
   is made which seems easy to the suggester, but is obviously (to the
   victim) a lot of work.

   and cute.  Like many other hackish terms for people, this one
   may be praise or insult depending on who uses it.  In general,

<h1><a name="snafu_principle">SNAFU principle</a></h1><pre> /sna'foo prin'si-pl/ n.  [from a WWII Army
   acronym for `Situation Normal, All Fucked Up'] "True
   communication is possible only between equals, because inferiors
   are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant
   lies than for telling the truth." -- a central tenet of
   <a href="d.htm#discordianism">Discordianism</a>, often invoked by hackers to explain why
   authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically.
   The effect of the SNAFU principle is a progressive disconnection of
   decision-makers from reality.  This lightly adapted version of a
   fable dating back to the early 1960s illustrates the phenomenon
   perfectly:

     In the beginning was the plan,
            and then the specification;
     And the plan was without form,
            and the specification was void.

     And darkness
            was on the faces of the implementors thereof;
     And they spake unto their leader,
            saying:
     "It is a crock of shit,
            and smells as of a sewer."

     And the leader took pity on them,
            and spoke to the project leader:
     "It is a crock of excrement,
            and none may abide the odor thereof."

     And the project leader
            spake unto his section head, saying:
     "It is a container of excrement,
            and it is very strong, such that none may abide it."

     The section head then hurried to his department manager,
            and informed him thus:
     "It is a vessel of fertilizer,
            and none may abide its strength."

     The department manager carried these words
           to his general manager,
     and spoke unto him
           saying:
     "It containeth that which aideth the growth of plants,
           and it is very strong."

     And so it was that the general manager rejoiced
           and delivered the good news unto the Vice President.
     "It promoteth growth,
           and it is very powerful."

     The Vice President rushed to the President's side,
           and joyously exclaimed:
     "This powerful new software product
           will promote the growth of the company!"

     And the President looked upon the product,
           and saw that it was very good.

   After the subsequent disaster, the <a href="s.htm#suit">suit</a>s protect themselves by
   saying "I was misinformed!", and the implementors are demoted or
   fired.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="snail-mail">snail-mail</a></h1><pre> n.  Paper mail, as opposed to electronic.
   Sometimes written as the single word `SnailMail'.  One's postal
   address is, correspondingly, a `snail address'.  Derives from
   earlier coinage `USnail' (from `U.S. Mail'), for which
   there have even been parody posters and stamps made.  Oppose

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="snap">snap</a></h1><pre> v.  To replace a pointer to a pointer with a direct
   pointer; to replace an old address with the forwarding address
   found there.  If you telephone the main number for an institution
   and ask for a particular person by name, the operator may tell you
   that person's extension before connecting you, in the hopes that
   you will `snap your pointer' and dial direct next time.  The
   underlying metaphor may be that of a rubber band stretched through
   a number of intermediate points; if you remove all the thumbtacks
   in the middle, it snaps into a straight line from first to last.
   See <a href="c.htm#chase_pointers">chase_pointers</a>.

   Often, the behavior of a <a href="t.htm#trampoline">trampoline</a> is to perform an error
   check once and then snap the pointer that invoked it so as
   henceforth to bypass the trampoline (and its one-shot error check).
   In this context one also speaks of `snapping links'.  For
   example, in a LISP implementation, a function interface trampoline
   might check to make sure that the caller is passing the correct
   number of arguments; if it is, and if the caller and the callee are
   both compiled, then snapping the link allows that particular path
   to use a direct procedure-call instruction with no further
   overhead.

<h1><a name="software_laser">software laser</a></h1><pre> n.  An optical laser works by bouncing

   in the crystal will excite cascades of more photons, all in
   lockstep.  Eventually the beam will escape through the

    involving <a href="b.htm#bounce_message">bounce_message</a>s can produce closely analogous

<h1><a name="software_rot">software rot</a></h1><pre> n.  Term used to describe the tendency of
   software that has not been used in a while to <a href="l.htm#lose">lose</a>; such
   failure may be semi-humorously ascribed to <a href="b.htm#bit_rot">bit_rot</a>.  More
   commonly, `software rot' strikes when a program's assumptions
   become out of date.  If the design was insufficiently <a href="r.htm#robust">robust</a>,
   this may cause it to fail in mysterious ways.

   For example, owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of
   COBOL programs, most will succumb to software rot when their
   2-digit year counters <a href="w.htm#wrap_around">wrap_around</a> at the beginning of the
   year 2000.  Actually, related lossages often afflict centenarians
   who have to deal with computer software designed by unimaginative
   clods.  One such incident became the focus of a minor public flap
   in 1990, when a gentleman born in 1889 applied for a driver's
   license renewal in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The new system
   refused to issue the card, probably because with 2-digit years the
   ages 101 and 1 cannot be distinguished.

   Historical note: Software rot in an even funnier sense than the
   mythical one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g.,
   the R1; see <a href="g.htm#grind_crank">grind_crank</a>).  If a program that depended on a
   peculiar instruction hadn't been run in quite a while, the user
   might discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they
   once did.  ("Hey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do
   such-and-such.  We can <a href="s.htm#snarf">snarf</a> this opcode, right?  No one uses
   it.")

   Another classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker
   found a simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump
   instruction on a PDP-6, so he patched the hardware.  Unfortunately,
   this broke some fragile timing software in a music-playing program,
   throwing its output out of tune.  This was fixed by adding a
   defensive initialization routine to compare the speed of a timing
   loop with the real-time clock; in other words, it figured out how
   fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected appropriately.

   the PDP-6, a hacker crufted together a <a href="q.htm#quick-and-dirty">quick-and-dirty</a>
   `stopgap editor' to be used until a better one was written.
   Unfortunately, the old one was never really discarded when new ones
   (in particular, <a href="t.htm#teco">TECO</a>) came along.  SOS is a descendant (`Son
   of Stopgap') of that editor, and many PDP-10 users gained the
   dubious pleasure of its acquaintance.  Since then other programs
   similar in style to SOS have been written, notably the early font
   editor BILOS /bye'lohs/, the Brother-In-Law Of Stopgap (the

<h1><a name="space-cadet_keyboard">space-cadet keyboard</a></h1><pre> n.  A now-legendary device used on MIT
   LISP machines, which inspired several still-current jargon terms
   and influenced the design of <a href="e.htm#emacs">EMACS</a>.  It was equipped with no
   fewer than *seven* shift keys: four keys for <a href="b.htm#bucky_bits">bucky_bits</a>
   (`control', `meta', `hyper', and `super') and three like
   regular shift keys, called `shift', `top', and `front'.  Many
   keys had three symbols on them: a letter and a symbol on the top,
   and a Greek letter on the front.  For example, the `L' key had an
   `L' and a two-way arrow on the top, and the Greek letter lambda on
   the front.  By pressing this key with the right hand while playing
   an appropriate `chord' with the left hand on the shift keys, you
   could get the following results:

     L
          lowercase l

     shift-L
          uppercase L

     front-L
          lowercase lambda

     front-shift-L
          uppercase lambda

     top-L
          two-way arrow (front and shift are ignored)

   And of course each of these might also be typed with any
   combination of the control, meta, hyper, and super keys.  On this
   keyboard, you could type over 8000 different characters!  This
   allowed the user to type very complicated mathematical text, and
   also to have thousands of single-character commands at his
   disposal.  Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the
   command meanings of that many characters if it reduced typing time
   (this attitude obviously shaped the interface of EMACS).  Other
   hackers, however, thought having that many bucky bits was overkill,
   and objected that such a keyboard can require three or four hands
   to operate.  See <a href="b.htm#bucky_bits">bucky_bits</a>, <a href="c.htm#cokebottle">cokebottle</a>, <a href="d.htm#double_bucky">double_bucky</a>,
   <a href="m.htm#meta_bit">meta_bit</a>, <a href="q.htm#quadruple_bucky">quadruple_bucky</a>.

   Note: early versions of this entry incorrectly identified the
   space-cadet keyboard with the `Knight keyboard'.  Though both
   were designed by Tom Knight, the latter term was properly applied
   only to a keyboard used for ITS on the PDP-10 and modeled on the
   Stanford keyboard (as described under <a href="b.htm#bucky_bits">bucky_bits</a>).  The true
   space-cadet keyboard evolved from the first Knight keyboard.

<h1><a name="spacewar">SPACEWAR</a></h1><pre> n.  A space-combat simulation game, inspired by
   E. E. "Doc" Smith's "Lensman" books, in which two
   spaceships duel around a central sun, shooting torpedoes at each
   other and jumping through hyperspace.  This game was first
   implemented on the PDP-1 at MIT in 1960--61.  SPACEWAR aficionados
   formed the core of the early hacker culture at MIT.  Nine years
   later, a descendant of the game motivated Ken Thompson to build, in
   his spare time on a scavenged PDP-7, the operating system that
   became <a href="u.htm#unix">UNIX</a>.  Less than nine years after that, SPACEWAR was

   flooded with irrelevant or inappropriate messages. You can spam a
   newsgroup with as little as one well- (or ill-) planned message
   (e.g. asking "What do you think of abortion?" on soc.women).
   This is often done with <a href="c.htm#cross-post">cross-post</a>ing (e.g. any message which
   is crossposted to alt.rush-limbaugh and
   alt.politics.homosexuality will almost inevitably spam both

<h1><a name="stack">stack</a></h1><pre> n.  The set of things a person has to do in the

   risen to the top of the stack.  "I'm afraid I've got real work to
   do, so this'll have to be pushed way down on my stack."  "I
   haven't done it yet because every time I pop my stack something new
   gets pushed."  If you are interrupted several times in the middle
   of a conversation, "My stack overflowed" means "I forget what we
   were talking about."  The implication is that more items were
   pushed onto the stack than could be remembered, so the least recent
   items were lost.  The usual physical example of a stack is to be
   found in a cafeteria: a pile of plates or trays sitting on a spring
   in a well, so that when you put one on the top they all sink down,
   and when you take one off the top the rest spring up a bit.  See
   also <a href="p.htm#push">push</a> and <a href="p.htm#pop">pop</a>.

   At MIT, <a href="p.htm#pdl">pdl</a> used to be a more common synonym for <a href="s.htm#stack">stack</a> in

   regurgitates up to 92 bytes on a bus fault.  On a pipelined
   machine, this can take a while.

<h1><a name="star_out">star out</a></h1><pre> v,  [University of York, England] To replace a
   user's encrypted password in /etc/passwd with a single
   asterisk. Under Unix this is not a legal encryption of any
   password; hence the user is not permitted to log in. In general,
   accounts like adm, news, and daemon are permanently "starred
   out"; occasionally a real user might have the this inflicted upon
   him/her as a punishment, e.g. "Graham was starred out for playing
   Omega in working hours". Also occasionally known as The Order Of
   The Gold Star in this context. "Don't do that, or you'll be
   awarded the Order of the Gold Star..."  Compare <a href="d.htm#disusered">disusered</a>.

<h1><a name="state">state</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Condition, situation.  "What's the state of
   your latest hack?"  "It's winning away."  "The system tried to
   read and write the disk simultaneously and got into a totally
   <a href="w.htm#wedged">wedged</a> state."  The standard question "What's your state?"
   means "What are you doing?" or "What are you about to do?"
   Typical answers are "about to gronk out", or "hungry".  Another
   standard question is "What's the state of the world?", meaning
   "What's new?" or "What's going on?".  The more terse and
   humorous way of asking these questions would be "State-p?".
   Another way of phrasing the first question under sense 1 would be
   "state-p latest hack?".  2. Information being maintained in
   non-permanent memory (electronic or human).

   electromechanical <a href="d.htm#dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s.  Sometimes used for the entire
   period up to 1960--61 (see <a href="i.htm#iron_age">Iron_Age</a>); however, it is funnier
   and more descriptive to characterize the latter period in terms of
   a `Bronze Age' era of transistor-logic, pre-ferrite-<a href="c.htm#core">core</a>

   delay lines and/or relays).  See also <a href="i.htm#iron_age">Iron_Age</a>.  2. More

<h1><a name="strided">strided</a></h1><pre> /str:'d*d/ adj.  [scientific computing] Said of a
   sequence of memory reads and writes to addresses, each of which is
   separated from the last by a constant interval called the `stride
   length'.  These can be a worst-case access pattern for the standard
   memory-caching schemes when the stride length is a multiple of the
   cache line size.  Strided references are often generated by loops
   through an array, and (if youre data is large enough that
   access-time is significant) it can be worthwhile to tune for better
   locality by inverting double loops or by partially unrolling the
   outer loop of a loop nest.  This usage is borderline techspeak; the
   related term `memory stride' is definitely techspeak.

   employ them; succinctly expresses an attitude at least as common,
   though usually better disguised, among other subcultures of
   hackers.  There may be intended reference here to an SF story
   originally published in 1952 but much anthologized since, Mark
   Clifton's "Star, Bright".  In it, a super-genius child
   classifies humans into a very few `Brights' like herself, a huge
   majority of `Stupids', and a minority of `Tweens', the merely
   ordinary geniuses.

<h1><a name="sturgeon's_law">Sturgeon's Law</a></h1><pre> prov.  "Ninety percent of everything is
   crap".  Derived from a quote by science fiction author Theodore
   Sturgeon, who once said, "Sure, 90% of science fiction is crud.
   That's because 90% of everything is crud."  Oddly, when Sturgeon's
   Law is cited, the final word is almost invariably changed to
   `crap'.  Compare <a href="h.htm#hanlon's_razor">Hanlon's_Razor</a>, <a href="n.htm#ninety-ninety_rule">Ninety-Ninety_Rule</a>.

<h1><a name="sucking_mud">sucking mud</a></h1><pre> [Applied Data Research] adj.  (also `pumping
   mud') Crashed or <a href="w.htm#wedged">wedged</a>.  Usually said of a machine that
   provides some service to a network, such as a file server.  This
   Dallas regionalism derives from the East Texas oilfield lament,
   "Shut 'er down, Ma, she's a-suckin' mud".  Often used as a query.

   often worn by non-hackers.  Invariably worn with a `tie', a
   strangulation device that partially cuts off the blood supply to
   the brain.  It is thought that this explains much about the
   behavior of suit-wearers.  Compare <a href="d.htm#droid">droid</a>.  2. A person who

    An expression used ironically to characterize unquantifiable
   behavior that differs from expected or required behavior.  For
   example, suppose a newly created program came up with a correct
   full-screen display, and one publicly exclaimed: "It works!"
   Then, if the program dumped core on the first mouse click, one
   might add: "Well, for suitably small values of `works'."

<h1><a name="sun_lounge">sun lounge</a></h1><pre> n.  [UK] The room where all the Sun workstations live.

<h1><a name="super_source_quench">super source quench</a></h1><pre> n.  A special packet designed to shut up
   an Internet host.  The Internet Protocol (IP) has a control message
   called Source Quench that asks a host to transmit more slowly on a
   particular connection to avoid congestion.  It also has a Redirect
   control message intended to instruct a host to send certain packets
   to a different local router.  A "super source quench" is actually
   a redirect control packet, forged to look like it came from a local
   router, that instructs a host to send all packets to its own local
   loopback address.  This will effectively tie many Internet hosts up
   in knots.  Compare <a href="g.htm#godzillagram">Godzillagram</a>, <a href="b.htm#breath-of-life_packet">breath-of-life_packet</a>

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="superprogrammer">superprogrammer</a></h1><pre> n.  A prolific programmer; one who can code
   exceedingly well and quickly.  Not all hackers are
   superprogrammers, but many are.  (Productivity can vary from one
   programmer to another by three orders of magnitude.  For example,
   one programmer might be able to write an average of 3 lines of
   working code in one day, while another, with the proper tools,
   might be able to write 3,000.  This range is astonishing; it is
   matched in very few other areas of human endeavor.)  The term
   `superprogrammer' is more commonly used within such places as IBM
   than in the hacker community.  It tends to stress naive measures of
   productivity and to underweight creativity, ingenuity, and getting
   the job *done* -- and to sidestep the question of whether the
   3,000 lines of code do more or less useful work than three lines
   that do the <a href="r.htm#right_thing">Right_Thing</a>.  Hackers tend to prefer the terms
   <a href="h.htm#hacker">hacker</a> and <a href="w.htm#wizard">wizard</a>.

<h1><a name="superuser">superuser</a></h1><pre> n.  [UNIX] Syn. <a href="r.htm#root">root</a>, <a href="a.htm#avatar">avatar</a>.  This usage has
   spread to non-UNIX environments; the superuser is any account with
   all <a href="w.htm#wheel">wheel</a> bits on.  A more specific term than <a href="w.htm#wheel">wheel</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="support">support</a></h1><pre> n.  After-sale handholding; something many software
   vendors promise but few deliver.  To hackers, most support people
   are useless -- because by the time a hacker calls support he or
   she will usually know the software and the relevant manuals better
   than the support people (sadly, this is *not* a joke or
   exaggeration).  A hacker's idea of `support' is a
   t^ete-`a-t^ete with the software's designer.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="surf">surf</a></h1><pre> v.  To traverse the Internet in search of interesting
   stuff, used esp. if one is doing so with a World-Wide-Web browser.

   English.  Also (fashionable among personkind wishing to avoid
   accusations of sexism) `Sammy Cobol' or (in some non-IBM circles)
   `Cobol Charlie'.  2. [proposed] Meta-name for any <a href="c.htm#code_grinder">code_grinder</a>

<h1><a name="swap">swap</a></h1><pre> vt.  1. [techspeak] To move information from a
   fast-access memory to a slow-access memory (`swap out'), or vice
   versa (`swap in').  Often refers specifically to the use of disks
   as `virtual memory'.  As pieces of data or program are needed,
   they are swapped into <a href="c.htm#core">core</a> for processing; when they are no
   longer needed they may be swapped out again.  2. The jargon use of
   these terms analogizes people's short-term memories with core.
   Cramming for an exam might be spoken of as swapping in.  If you
   temporarily forget someone's name, but then remember it, your
   excuse is that it was swapped out.  To `keep something swapped
   in' means to keep it fresh in your memory: "I reread the TECO
   manual every few months to keep it swapped in."  If someone
   interrupts you just as you got a good idea, you might say "Wait a
   moment while I swap this out", implying that a piece of paper is
   your extra-somatic memory and that if you don't swap the idea out
   by writing it down it will get overwritten and lost as you talk.

<h1><a name="swizzle">swizzle</a></h1><pre> v.  To convert external names, array indices, or
   references within a data structure into address pointers when the
   data structure is brought into main memory from external storage
   (also called `pointer swizzling'); this may be done for speed in
   chasing references or to simplify code (e.g., by turning lots of
   name lookups into pointer dereferences).  The converse operation is
   sometimes termed `unswizzling'.  See also <a href="s.htm#snap">snap</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="sync">sync</a></h1><pre> /sink/ n., vi.  (var. `synch') 1. To synchronize,

   I/O to the disk; see <a href="f.htm#flush">flush</a>, sense 2.  3. More generally, to
   force a number of competing processes or agents to a state that
   would be `safe' if the system were to crash; thus, to checkpoint
   (in the database-theory sense).

<h1><a name="syntactic_salt">syntactic salt</a></h1><pre> n.  The opposite of <a href="s.htm#syntactic_sugar">syntactic_sugar</a>, a
   feature designed to make it harder to write bad code.
   Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop the programmer must jump
   through just to prove that he knows what's going on, rather than to
   express a program action.  Some programmers consider required type
   declarations to be syntactic salt.  A requirement to write
   `end if', `end while', `end do', etc. to terminate
   the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed to
   just `end') would definitely be syntactic salt.  Syntactic
   salt is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers'
   blood pressures in an unhealthy way.  Compare <a href="c.htm#candygrammar">candygrammar</a>.  .

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a></h1><pre> n.  [coined by Peter Landin] Features added
   to a language or other formalism to make it `sweeter' for
   humans, features which do not affect the expressiveness of the
   formalism (compare <a href="c.htm#chrome">chrome</a>).  Used esp. when there is an
   obvious and trivial translation of the `sugar' feature into
   other constructs already present in the notation.  C's `a[i]'
   notation is syntactic sugar for `*(a + i)'.  "Syntactic sugar
   causes cancer of the semicolon." -- Alan Perlis.

   The variants `syntactic saccharin' and `syntactic syrup' are
   also recorded.  These denote something even more gratuitous, in
   that syntactic sugar serves a purpose (making something more
   acceptable to humans), but syntactic saccharin or syrup serve no
   purpose at all.  Compare <a href="c.htm#candygrammar">candygrammar</a>, <a href="s.htm#syntactic_salt">syntactic_salt</a>.
