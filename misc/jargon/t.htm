<h1><a name="t">T</a></h1><pre> /T/  1. [from LISP terminology for `true'] Yes.  Used
   in reply to a question (particularly one asked using <a href="howwork.htm#the_`-p'_convention">The_`-P'_convention</a>
   ).  In LISP, the constant T means `true', among other
   things.  Some hackers use `T' and `NIL' instead of `Yes' and `No'
   almost reflexively.  This sometimes causes misunderstandings.  When
   a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a hacker wants coffee, he
   may well respond `T', meaning that he wants coffee; but of course
   he will be brought a cup of tea instead.  As it happens, most
   hackers (particularly those who frequent Chinese restaurants) like
   tea at least as well as coffee -- so it is not that big a problem.
   2. See <a href="t.htm#time_t">time_T</a> (also <a href="s.htm#since_time_t_equals_minus_infinity">since_time_T_equals_minus_infinity</a>).
   3. [techspeak] In transaction-processing circles, an abbreviation
   for the noun `transaction'.  4. [Purdue] Alternate spelling of
   <a href="t.htm#tee">tee</a>.  5. A dialect of <a href="l.htm#lisp">LISP</a> developed at Yale.

<h1><a name="tail_recursion">tail recursion</a></h1><pre> n.  If you aren't sick of it already, see
   <a href="t.htm#tail_recursion">tail_recursion</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="talk_mode">talk mode</a></h1><pre> n.  A feature supported by UNIX, ITS, and some
   other OSes that allows two or more logged-in users to set up a
   real-time on-line conversation.  It combines the immediacy of
   talking with all the precision (and verbosity) that written
   language entails.  It is difficult to communicate inflection,
   though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section
   on writing style in the Prependices for details).

   Talk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing,
   which are not used orally.  Some of these are identical to (and
   probably derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs
   since the 1920s.

     AFAIK
          as far as I know
     BCNU
          be seeing you
     BTW
          by the way
     BYE?
          are you ready to unlink?  (this is the standard way to end a
          talk-mode conversation; the other person types `BYE' to
          confirm, or else continues the conversation)
     CUL
          see you later
     ENQ?
          are you busy?  (expects `ACK' or `NAK' in return)
     FOO?
          are you there? (often used on unexpected links, meaning also
          "Sorry if I butted in ..." (linker) or "What's up?"
          (linkee))
     FWIW
          for what it's worth
     FYI
          for your information
     FYA
          for your amusement
     GA
          go ahead (used when two people have tried to type
          simultaneously; this cedes the right to type to the other)
     GRMBL
          grumble (expresses disquiet or disagreement)
     HELLOP
          hello? (an instance of the `-P' convention)
     JAM
          just a minute (equivalent to `SEC....')
     MIN
          same as `JAM'
     NIL
          no (see <a href="n.htm#nil">NIL</a>)
     O
          over to you
     OO
          over and out
     /
          another form of "over to you" (from x/y as "x over y")
     \
          lambda (used in discussing LISPy things)
     OBTW
          oh, by the way
     OTOH
          on the other hand
     R U THERE?
          are you there?
     SEC
          wait a second (sometimes written `SEC...')
     T
          yes (see the main entry for <a href="t.htm#t">T</a>)
     TNX
          thanks
     TNX 1.0E6
          thanks a million (humorous)
     TNXE6
          another form of "thanks a million"
     WRT
          with regard to, or with respect to.
     WTF
          the universal interrogative particle; WTF knows what it
          means?
     WTH
          what the hell?
     &ltdouble newline&gt
          When the typing party has finished, he/she types two
          newlines to signal that he/she is done; this leaves a blank
          line between `speeches' in the conversation, making it
          easier to reread the preceding text.
     &ltname&gt:
          When three or more terminals are linked, it is conventional
          for each typist to <a href="p.htm#prepend">prepend</a> his/her login name or handle
          and a colon (or a hyphen) to each line to indicate who is
          typing (some conferencing facilities do this automatically).
          The login name is often shortened to a unique prefix
          (possibly a single letter) during a very long conversation.
     /\/\/\
          A giggle or chuckle.  On a MUD, this usually means
          `earthquake fault'.

   Most of the above sub-jargon is used at both Stanford and MIT.
   Several of these expressions are also common in <a href="e.htm#email">email</a>, esp.
   FYI, FYA, BTW, BCNU, WTF, and CUL.  A few other abbreviations have
   been reported from commercial networks, such as GEnie and
   CompuServe, where on-line `live' chat including more than two
   people is common and usually involves a more `social' context,
   notably the following:

     &ltg&gt
          grin
     &ltgr&d&gt
          grinning, running, and ducking
     BBL
          be back later
     BRB
          be right back
     HHOJ
          ha ha only joking
     HHOK
          ha ha only kidding
     HHOS
          <a href="h.htm#ha_ha_only_serious">ha_ha_only_serious</a>
     IMHO
          in my humble opinion (see <a href="i.htm#imho">IMHO</a>)
     LOL
          laughing out loud
     NHOH
          Never Heard of Him/Her (often used in <a href="i.htm#initgame">initgame</a>)
     ROTF
          rolling on the floor
     ROTFL
          rolling on the floor laughing
     AFK
          away from keyboard
     b4
          before
     CU l8tr
          see you later
     MORF
          male or female?
     TTFN
          ta-ta for now
     TTYL
          talk to you later
     OIC
          oh, I see
     rehi
          hello again

   Most of these are not used at universities or in the UNIX world,
   though ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is
   common; conversely, most of the people who know these are
   unfamiliar with FOO?, BCNU, HELLOP, <a href="n.htm#nil">NIL</a>, and <a href="t.htm#t">T</a>.

   The <a href="m.htm#mud">MUD</a> community uses a mixture of Usenet/Internet emoticons,
   a few of the more natural of the old-style talk-mode abbrevs, and
   some of the `social' list above; specifically, MUD respondents
   report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF, TTFN, and WTH.  The use
   of `rehi' is also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re-
   compounds and will frequently `rehug' or `rebonk' (see
   <a href="b.htm#bonk/oif">bonk/oif</a>) people.  The word `re' by itself is taken as
   `regreet'.  In general, though, MUDders express a preference for
   typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations; this may
   be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to
   include many touch typists and to assume high-speed links.  The
   following uses specific to MUDs are reported:

     CU l8er
          see you later (mutant of `CU l8tr')
     FOAD
          fuck off and die (use of this is generally OTT)
     OTT
          over the top (excessive, uncalled for)
     ppl
          abbrev for "people"
     THX
          thanks (mutant of `TNX'; clearly this comes in batches of
          1138 (the Lucasian K)).
     UOK?
          are you OK?

   Some <a href="b.htm#b1ff">B1FF</a>isms (notably the variant spelling `d00d')
   appear to be passing into wider use among some subgroups of
   MUDders.

   One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode,
   often seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because
   they are typing rather than speaking.  This is not the best
   approach.  It can be very frustrating to wait while your partner
   pauses to think of a word, or repeatedly makes the same spelling
   error and backs up to fix it.  It is usually best just to leave
   typographical errors behind and plunge forward, unless severe
   confusion may result; in that case it is often fastest just to type
   "xxx" and start over from before the mistake.

<h1><a name="talker_system">talker system</a></h1><pre> n.  British hackerism for software that
   enables real-time chat or <a href="t.htm#talk_mode">talk_mode</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tall_card">tall card</a></h1><pre> n.  A PC/AT-size expansion card (these can be
   larger than IBM PC or XT cards because the AT case is bigger).  See
   also <a href="s.htm#short_card">short_card</a>.  When IBM introduced the PS/2 model 30 (its
   last gasp at supporting the ISA) they made the case lower and many
   industry-standard tall cards wouldn't fit; this was felt to be a
   reincarnation of the <a href="c.htm#connector_conspiracy">connector_conspiracy</a>, done with less
   style.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tanked">tanked</a></h1><pre> adj.  Same as <a href="d.htm#down">down</a>, used primarily by UNIX
   hackers.  See also <a href="h.htm#hosed">hosed</a>.  Popularized as a synonym for
   `drunk' by Steve Dallas in the late lamented "Bloom County"
   comic strip.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tanstaafl">TANSTAAFL</a></h1><pre> /tan'stah-fl/  [acronym, from Robert Heinlein's
   classic "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress".]  "There Ain't No
   Such Thing As A Free Lunch", often invoked when someone is balking
   at the prospect of using an unpleasantly <a href="h.htm#heavyweight">heavyweight</a>
   technique, or at the poor quality of some piece of free software,
   or at the <a href="s.htm#signal-to-noise_ratio">signal-to-noise_ratio</a> of unmoderated Usenet
   newsgroups.  "What? Don't tell me I have to implement a database
   back end to get my address book program to work!"  "Well,
   TANSTAAFL you know."  This phrase owes some of its popularity to
   the high concentration of science-fiction fans and political
   libertarians in hackerdom (see <a href="appa.htm#a_portrait_of_j._random_hacker">A_Portrait_of_J._Random_Hacker</a>
    in Appendix B).

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tar_and_feather">tar and feather</a></h1><pre> vi.  [from UNIX `tar(1)'] To create a
   transportable archive from a group of files by first sticking them
   together with `tar(1)' (the Tape ARchiver) and then
   compressing the result (see <a href="c.htm#compress">compress</a>).  The latter action is
   dubbed `feathering' partly for euphony and (if only for contrived
   effect) by analogy to what you do with an airplane propeller to
   decrease wind resistance, or with an oar to reduce water
   resistance; smaller files, after all, slip through comm links more
   easily.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="taste">taste</a></h1><pre> [primarily MIT] n.  1. The quality in a program that
   tends to be inversely proportional to the number of features,
   hacks, and kluges programmed into it.  Also `tasty',
   `tasteful', `tastefulness'.  "This feature comes in N
   tasty flavors."  Although `tasty' and `flavorful' are
   essentially synonyms, `taste' and <a href="f.htm#flavor">flavor</a> are not.  Taste
   refers to sound judgment on the part of the creator; a program or
   feature can *exhibit* taste but cannot *have* taste.  On
   the other hand, a feature can have <a href="f.htm#flavor">flavor</a>.  Also, <a href="f.htm#flavor">flavor</a>
   has the additional meaning of `kind' or `variety' not shared by
   `taste'.  The marked sense of <a href="f.htm#flavor">flavor</a> is more popular than
   `taste', though both are widely used.  See also <a href="e.htm#elegant">elegant</a>.
   2. Alt. sp. of <a href="t.htm#tayste">tayste</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tayste">tayste</a></h1><pre> /tayst/  n. Two bits; also as <a href="t.htm#taste">taste</a>.
   Syn. <a href="c.htm#crumb">crumb</a>, <a href="q.htm#quarter">quarter</a>.  See <a href="n.htm#nybble">nybble</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tcb">TCB</a></h1><pre> /T-C-B/  n.  [IBM] 1. Trouble Came Back.  An
   intermittent or difficult-to-reproduce problem that has failed to
   respond to neglect or <a href="s.htm#shotgun_debugging">shotgun_debugging</a>.  Compare
   <a href="h.htm#heisenbug">heisenbug</a>.  Not to be confused with: 2. Trusted Computing
   Base, an `official' jargon term from the <a href="o.htm#orange_book">Orange_Book</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tcp/ip">TCP/IP</a></h1><pre> n.  1. [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol]
   The wide-area-networking protocol that makes the Internet work, and
   the only one most hackers can speak the name of without laughing or
   retching.  Unlike such allegedly `standard' competitors such as
   X.25, DECnet, and the ISO 7-layer stack, TCP/IP evolved primarily
by
   actually being *used*, rather than being handed down from on
   high by a vendor or a heavily-politicized standards committee.
   Consequently, it (a) works, (b) actually promotes cheap
   cross-platform connectivity, and (c) annoys the hell out of
   corporate and governmental empire-builders everywhere.  Hackers
   value all three of these properties. See <a href="c.htm#creationism">creationism</a>.  2.
   [Amateur Packet Redio] Sometimes expanded as "The Crap Phil Is
   Pushing".  The reference is to Phil Karn, KA9NQ, and the context
   is an ongoing technical/political war between the majority of sites
   still running AX.25 and a growing minority of TCP/IP relays.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tea,_iso_standard_cup_of">tea, ISO standard cup of</a></h1><pre> n.  [South Africa] A cup of tea
   with milk and one teaspoon of sugar, where the milk is poured into
   the cup before the tea.  Variations are ISO 0, with no sugar; ISO
   2, with two spoons of sugar; and so on.

   Like many ISO standards, this one has a faintly alien ring in North
   America, where hackers generally shun the decadent British practice
   of adulterating perfectly good tea with dairy products and
   prefer instead to add a wedge of lemon, if anything.  If one were
   feeling extremely silly, one might hypothesize an analogous `ANSI
   standard cup of tea' and wind up with a political situation
   distressingly similar to several that arise in much more serious
   technical contexts.  Milk and lemon don't mix very well.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="techref">TechRef</a></h1><pre> /tek'ref/ n.  [MS-DOS] The original "IBM PC
   Technical Reference Manual", including the BIOS listing and
   complete schematics for the PC.  The only PC documentation in the
   issue package that's considered serious by real hackers.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="teco">TECO</a></h1><pre> /tee'koh/ n.,v.,obs.  1. [originally an acronym for
   `[paper] Tape Editor and COrrector'; later, `Text Editor and
   COrrector'] n. A text editor developed at MIT and modified by just
   about everybody.  With all the dialects included, TECO may have
   been the most prolific editor in use before <a href="e.htm#emacs">EMACS</a>, to which it
   was directly ancestral.  Noted for its powerful
   programming-language-like features and its unspeakably hairy
   syntax.  It is literally the case that every string of characters
   is a valid TECO program (though probably not a useful one); one
   common game used to be mentally working out what the TECO commands
   corresponding to human names did.  2. vt. Originally, to edit using
   the TECO editor in one of its infinite variations (see below).
   3. vt.,obs.  To edit even when TECO is *not* the editor being
   used!  This usage is rare and now primarily historical.

   As an example of TECO's obscurity, here is a TECO program that
   takes a list of names such as:

     Loser, J. Random
     Quux, The Great
     Dick, Moby

   sorts them alphabetically according to surname, and then puts the
   surname last, removing the comma, to produce the following:

     Moby Dick
     J. Random Loser
     The Great Quux

   The program is

     [1 J^P$L$$
     J &lt.-Z; .,(S,$ -D .)FX1 @F^B $K :L I $ G1 L&gt$$

   (where ^B means `Control-B' (ASCII 0000010) and $ is actually
   an <a href="a.htm#alt">alt</a> or escape (ASCII 0011011) character).

   In fact, this very program was used to produce the second, sorted
   list from the first list.  The first hack at it had a <a href="b.htm#bug">bug</a>: GLS
   (the author) had accidentally omitted the `@' in front
   of `F^B', which as anyone can see is clearly the <a href="w.htm#wrong_thing">Wrong_Thing</a>.  It
   worked fine the second time.  There is no space to describe all the
   features of TECO, but it may be of interest that `^P' means
   `sort' and `J&lt.-Z; ... L&gt' is an idiomatic series of commands
   for `do once for every line'.

   In mid-1991, TECO is pretty much one with the dust of history,
   having been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by <a href="e.htm#emacs">EMACS</a>.
   Descendants of an early (and somewhat lobotomized) version adopted
   by DEC can still be found lurking on VMS and a couple of crufty
   PDP-11 operating systems, however, and ports of the more advanced
   MIT versions remain the focus of some antiquarian interest.  See
   also <a href="r.htm#retrocomputing">retrocomputing</a>, <a href="w.htm#write-only_language">write-only_language</a>.


</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tee">tee</a></h1><pre> n.,vt.  [Purdue] A carbon copy of an electronic
   transmission.  "Oh, you're sending him the <a href="b.htm#bits">bits</a> to that?
   Slap on a tee for me."  From the UNIX command `tee(1)',
   itself named after a pipe fitting (see <a href="p.htm#plumbing">plumbing</a>).  Can also
   mean `save one for me', as in "Tee a slice for me!"  Also
   spelled `T'.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="teledildonics">teledildonics</a></h1><pre> /tel`*-dil-do'-niks/ n.  Sex in a computer
   simulated virtual reality, esp. computer-mediated sexual
   interaction between the <a href="v.htm#vr">VR</a> presences of two humans.  This
   practice is not yet possible except in the rather limited form of
   erotic conversation on <a href="m.htm#mud">MUD</a>s and the like.  The term, however,
   is widely recognized in the VR community as a <a href="h.htm#ha_ha_only_serious">ha_ha_only_serious</a>
    projection of things to come.  "When we can sustain a
   multi-sensory surround good enough for teledildonics, *then*
   we'll know we're getting somewhere." See also <a href="h.htm#hot_chat">hot_chat</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="telerat">Telerat</a></h1><pre> /tel'*-rat/ n.  Unflattering hackerism for
   `Teleray', a line of extremely losing terminals.  Compare
   <a href="a.htm#aidx">AIDX</a>, <a href="m.htm#macintrash">Macintrash</a> <a href="n.htm#nominal_semidestructor">Nominal_Semidestructor</a>, <a href="o.htm#open_deathtrap">Open_DeathTrap</a>

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="telnet">TELNET</a></h1><pre> /tel'net/ vt.  (also commonly lowercased as
   `telnet') To communicate with another Internet host using the
   TELNET (<a href="r.htm#rfc">RFC</a> 854) protocol (usually using a program of the same
   name).  TOPS-10 people used the word IMPCOM, since that was the
   program name for them.  Sometimes abbreviated to TN /T-N/.  "I
   usually TN over to SAIL just to read the AP News."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ten-finger_interface">ten-finger interface</a></h1><pre> n.  The interface between two networks
   that cannot be directly connected for security reasons; refers to
   the practice of placing two terminals side by side and having an
   operator read from one and type into the other.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tense">tense</a></h1><pre> adj.  Of programs, very clever and efficient.  A tense
   piece of code often got that way because it was highly <a href="b.htm#bum">bum</a>med,
   but sometimes it was just based on a great idea.  A comment in a
   clever routine by Mike Kazar, once a grad-student hacker at CMU:
   "This routine is so tense it will bring tears to your eyes."  A
   tense programmer is one who produces tense code.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tentacle">tentacle</a></h1><pre> n.  A covert <a href="p.htm#pseudo">pseudo</a>, sense 1.  An artificial
   identity created in cyberspace for nefarious and deceptive
   purposes.  The implication is that single person may have multiple
   tentacles.  This term was originally floated in some paranoid
   ravings on the cypherpunks list (see <a href="c.htm#cypherpunk">cypherpunk</a>, and adopted
   in a spirit of irony by other members. It has since shown up, used
   seriously, in the documentation for some remailer software, and is
   now (1994) widely recognized on the net.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="tenured_graduate_student">tenured graduate student</a></h1><pre> n.  One who has been in graduate
   school for 10 years (the usual maximum is 5 or 6): a `ten-yeared'
   student (get it?).  Actually, this term may be used of any grad
   student beginning in his seventh year.  Students don't really get
   tenure, of course, the way professors do, but a tenth-year graduate
   student has probably been around the university longer than any
   untenured professor.

<h1><a name="tex">TeX</a></h1><pre>: /tekh/ n.  X An extremely powerful <a href="m.htm#macro">macro</a>-based text formatter
written by
   Donald E. <a href="k.htm#knuth">Knuth</a>, very popular in the computer-science
   community (it is good enough to have displaced UNIX <a href="t.htm#troff">troff</a>, the
   other favored formatter, even at many UNIX installations).  TeX
   fans insist on the correct (guttural) pronunciation, and the
   correct spelling (all caps, squished together, with the E depressed
   below the baseline; the mixed-case `TeX' is considered an
   acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices).  Fans like to proliferate
   names from the word `TeX' -- such as TeXnician (TeX
   user), TeXhacker (TeX programmer), TeXmaster (competent
   TeX programmer), TeXhax, and TeXnique.  See also
   <a href="c.htm#craptex">CrApTeX</a>.

   Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining
   quality of the typesetting in volumes I--III of his monumental
   "Art of Computer Programming" (see <a href="k.htm#knuth">Knuth</a>, also
   <a href="b.htm#bible">bible</a>).  In a manifestation of the typical hackish urge to
   solve the problem at hand once and for all, he began to design his
   own typesetting language.  He thought he would finish it on his
   sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8 years.  The
   language was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of "The
   Art of Computer Programming" has yet to appear as of mid-1993.  The
   impact and influence of TeX's design has been such that nobody
   minds this very much.  Many grand hackish projects have started as
   a bit of <a href="t.htm#toolsmith">toolsmith</a>ing on the way to something else; Knuth's
   diversion was simply on a grander scale than most.

   TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but
   high-quality software.  Knuth used to offer monetary awards to
   people who found and reported bugs in it; as the years wore on and
   the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to
   find), the bribe went up.  Though well-written, TeX is so large
   (and so full of cutting edge technique) that it is said to have
   unearthed at least one bug in every Pascal system it has been
   compiled with.

<h1><a name="thunk">thunk</a></h1><pre> /thuhnk/ n.  1. "A piece of coding which provides
   an address", according to P. Z. Ingerman, who invented thunks in
   1961 as a way of binding actual parameters to their formal
   definitions in Algol-60 procedure calls.  If a procedure is called
   with an expression in the place of a formal parameter, the compiler
   generates a thunk which computes the expression and leaves the
   address of the result in some standard location.  2. Later
   generalized into: an expression, frozen together with its
   environment, for later evaluation if and when needed (similar to
   what in techspeak is called a `closure').  The process of
   unfreezing these thunks is called `forcing'.  3. A
   <a href="s.htm#stubroutine">stubroutine</a>, in an overlay programming environment, that loads
   and jumps to the correct overlay.  Compare <a href="t.htm#trampoline">trampoline</a>.
   4. People and activities scheduled in a thunklike manner.  "It
   occurred to me the other day that I am rather accurately modeled by
   a thunk -- I frequently need to be forced to completion." ---
   paraphrased from a <a href="p.htm#plan_file">plan_file</a>.

   Historical note: There are a couple of onomatopoeic myths
   circulating about the origin of this term.  The most common is that
   it is the sound made by data hitting the stack; another holds that
   the sound is that of the data hitting an accumulator.  Yet another
   suggests that it is the sound of the expression being unfrozen at
   argument-evaluation time.  In fact, according to the inventors, it
   was coined after they realized (in the wee hours after hours of
   discussion) that the type of an argument in Algol-60 could be
   figured out in advance with a little compile-time thought,
   simplifying the evaluation machinery.  In other words, it had
   `already been thought of'; thus it was christened a `thunk',
   which is "the past tense of `think' at two in the morning".

<h1><a name="tiger_team">tiger team</a></h1><pre> n.  [U.S. military jargon] 1. Originally, a team
   (of <a href="s.htm#sneaker">sneaker</a>s) whose purpose is to penetrate security, and thus
   test security measures.  These people are paid professionals who do
   hacker-type tricks, e.g., leave cardboard signs saying "bomb" in
   critical defense installations, hand-lettered notes saying "Your
   codebooks have been stolen" (they usually haven't been) inside
   safes, etc.  After a successful penetration, some high-ranking
   security type shows up the next morning for a `security review'
   and finds the sign, note, etc., and all hell breaks loose.  Serious
   successes of tiger teams sometimes lead to early retirement for
   base commanders and security officers (see the <a href="p.htm#patch">patch</a> entry for
   an example).  2. Recently, and more generally, any official
   inspection team or special <a href="f.htm#firefighting">firefighting</a> group called in to
   look at a problem.

   A subset of tiger teams are professional <a href="c.htm#cracker">cracker</a>s, testing the
   security of military computer installations by attempting remote
   attacks via networks or supposedly `secure' comm channels.  Some of
   their escapades, if declassified, would probably rank among the
   greatest hacks of all times.  The term has been adopted in
   commercial computer-security circles in this more specific sense.

<h1><a name="time_bomb">time bomb</a></h1><pre> n.  A subspecies of <a href="l.htm#logic_bomb">logic_bomb</a> that is
   triggered by reaching some preset time, either once or
   periodically.  There are numerous legends about time bombs set up
   by programmers in their employers' machines, to go off if the
   programmer is fired or laid off and is not present to perform the
   appropriate suppressing action periodically.

   Interestingly, the only such incident for which we have been
   pointed to documentary evidence took place in the Soviet Union in
   1986!  A disgruntled programmer at the Volga Automobile Plant
   (where the Fiat clones called Ladas were manufactured) planted a
   time bomb which, a week after he'd left on vacation, stopped the
   entire main assembly line for a day.  The case attracted lots of
   attention in the Soviet Union because it was the first cracking
   case to make it to court there.  The perpetrator got a suspended
   sentence of 3 years in jail and was barred from future work as a
   programmer.

<h1><a name="time_t">time T</a></h1><pre> /ti:m T/ n.  1. An unspecified but usually

   T+1.  "We'll meet on campus at time T or at Louie's
   at time T+1" means, in the context of going out for dinner:
   "We can meet on campus and go to Louie's, or we can meet at
   Louie's itself a bit later."  (Louie's was a Chinese restaurant in
   Palo Alto that was a favorite with hackers.)  Had the number 30
   been used instead of the number 1, it would have implied that the
   travel time from campus to Louie's is 30 minutes; whatever time
   T is (and that hasn't been decided on yet), you can meet
   half an hour later at Louie's than you could on campus and end up
   eating at the same time.  See also <a href="s.htm#since_time_t_equals_minus_infinity">since_time_T_equals_minus_infinity</a>

<h1><a name="tla">TLA</a></h1><pre> /T-L-A/ n.  [Three-Letter Acronym] 1. Self-describing
   abbreviation for a species with which computing terminology is

   SNA, CPU, MMU, SCCS, DMU, FPU, NNTP, TLA.  People who like this
   looser usage argue that not all TLAs have three letters, just as
   not all four-letter words have four letters.  One also hears of
   `ETLA' (Extended Three-Letter Acronym, pronounced /ee tee el
   ay/) being used to describe four-letter acronyms.  The term
   `SFLA' (Stupid Four-Letter Acronym) has also been reported.  See
   also <a href="y.htm#yaba">YABA</a>.

   The self-effacing phrase "TDM TLA" (Too Damn Many...) is
   often used to bemoan the plethora of TLAs in use.  In 1989, a
   random of the journalistic persuasion asked hacker Paul Boutin
   "What do you think will be the biggest problem in computing in
   the 90s?"  Paul's straight-faced response: "There are only
   17,000 three-letter acronyms." (To be exact, there are 26^3

<h1><a name="tmrc">TMRC</a></h1><pre> /tmerk'/ n.  The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one
   of the wellsprings of hacker culture.  The 1959 "Dictionary of
   the TMRC Language" compiled by Peter Samson included several terms
   that became basics of the hackish vocabulary (see esp. <a href="f.htm#foo">foo</a>,
   <a href="m.htm#mung">mung</a>, and <a href="f.htm#frob">frob</a>).

   By 1962, TMRC's legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity
   (and has grown in the thirty years since; all the features
   described here are still present).  The control system alone
   featured about 1200 relays.  There were <a href="s.htm#scram_switch">scram_switch</a>es located
   at numerous places around the room that could be thwacked if
   something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going
   full-bore at an obstruction.  Another feature of the system was a
   digital clock on the dispatch board, which was itself something of
   a wonder in those bygone days before cheap LEDS and seven-segment
   displays.  When someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and
   the display was replaced with the word `FOO'; at TMRC the scram
   switches are therefore called `foo switches'.

   Steven Levy, in his book "Hackers" (see the
   <a href="appb.htm#bibliography">Bibliography</a> in Appendix C), gives a stimulating account of
   those early years.  TMRC's Power and Signals group included most of
   the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who later bacame the core of
   the MIT AI Lab staff.  Thirty years later that connection is still
   very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly includes a number of
   entries from a recent revision of the TMRC dictionary.

<h1><a name="toggle">toggle</a></h1><pre> vt.  To change a <a href="b.htm#bit">bit</a> from whatever state it is
   in to the other state; to change from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1.  This
   comes from `toggle switches', such as standard light switches,
   though the word `toggle' actually refers to the mechanism that
   keeps the switch in the position to which it is flipped rather than
   to the fact that the switch has two positions.  There are four
   things you can do to a bit: set it (force it to be 1), clear (or
   zero) it, leave it alone, or toggle it.  (Mathematically, one would
   say that there are four distinct boolean-valued functions of one
   boolean argument, but saying that is much less fun than talking
   about toggling bits.)

   Whether a given piece of info falls in this category depends partly
   on what the user is looking for at any given time.  The `bytes

   tourist information; so (most of the time) is the TIME information

   condemnatory, as is <a href="b.htm#bitty_box">bitty_box</a>; toys can at least be fun.  It

   some <a href="h.htm#hll">HLL</a> and program-overlay implementations (e.g., on the
   Macintosh), that involves on-the-fly generation of small executable
   (and, likely as not, self-modifying) code objects to do indirection
   between code sections.  These pieces of <a href="l.htm#live_data">live_data</a> are called
   `trampolines'.  Trampolines are notoriously difficult to

<h1><a name="trap">trap</a></h1><pre>  1. n. A program interrupt, usually an interrupt caused
   by some exceptional situation in the user program.  In most cases,
   the OS performs some action, then returns control to the program.
   2. vi. To cause a trap.  "These instructions trap to the
   monitor."  Also used transitively to indicate the cause of the
   trap.  "The monitor traps all input/output instructions."

   This term is associated with assembler programming (`interrupt'
   or `exception' is more common among <a href="h.htm#hll">HLL</a> programmers) and
   appears to be fading into history among programmers as the role of
   assembler continues to shrink.  However, it is still important to
   computer architects and systems hackers (see <a href="s.htm#system">system</a>,
   sense 1), who use it to distinguish deterministically repeatable
   exceptions from timing-dependent ones (such as I/O interrupts).

<h1><a name="tree-killer">tree-killer</a></h1><pre> n.  [Sun] 1. A printer.  2. A person who wastes

   `wasting paper' includes the production of <a href="s.htm#spiffy">spiffy</a> but
   <a href="c.htm#content-free">content-free</a> documents.  Thus, most <a href="s.htm#suit">suit</a>s are

   for example, in the context of a <a href="f.htm#flag">flag</a> that should actually be
   able to assume *three* values -- such as yes, no, or unknown.
   Trits are sometimes jokingly called `3-state bits'.  A trit may

   thought of them already.  4. Any problem one has already solved
   (some claim that hackish `trivial' usually evaluates to `I've

<h1><a name="troff">troff</a></h1><pre>: /T'rof/ or /trof/ n.   [UNIX] The gray
   eminence of UNIX text processing; a formatting and phototypesetting
   program, written originally in PDP-11 assembler and then in
   barely-structured early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after
   the earlier ROFF which was in turn modeled after Multics' RUNOFF by
   Jerome Saltzer (*that* name came from the expression "to run
   off a copy").  A companion program, <a href="n.htm#nroff">nroff</a>, formats output for
   terminals and line printers.

   In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified `troff' so that it could
   drive phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT.  His
   paper describing that work ("A Typesetter-independent troff,"
   AT&T CSTR #97) explains troff's durability.  After discussing the
   program's "obvious deficiencies -- a rebarbative input syntax,
   mysterious and undocumented properties in some areas, and a
   voracious appetite for computer resources" and noting the ugliness
   and extreme hairiness of the code and internals, Kernighan
   concludes:

     None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating Ossanna's
     accomplishment with TROFF.  It has proven a remarkably robust
     tool, taking unbelievable abuse from a variety of preprocessors
     and being forced into uses that were never conceived of in the
     original design, all with considerable grace under fire.

   The success of <a href="t.htm#tex">TeX</a> and desktop publishing systems have
   reduced `troff''s relative importance, but this tribute
   perfectly captures the strengths that secured `troff' a place
   in hacker folklore; indeed, it could be taken more generally as an
   indication of those qualities of good programs that, in the long
   run, hackers most admire.

   phrase "trolling for <a href="n.htm#newbie">newbie</a>s" or some similar construction.
   The well-constructed troll is a post that induces lots of newbies

   already do, while subtly conveying to the more savvy and
   experienced that it is in fact a deliberate troll.  If you don't
   fall for the joke, you get to be in on it.

   undertones. 1. A terminal of the teletype variety, characterized by
   a noisy mechanical printer, a very limited character set, and poor
   print quality.  Usage: antiquated (like the TTYs themselves).  See
   also <a href="b.htm#bit-paired_keyboard">bit-paired_keyboard</a>.  2. [especially UNIX] Any terminal
   at all; sometimes used to refer to the particular terminal
   controlling a given job.  3. [UNIX] Any serial port, whether or not
   the device connected to it is a terminal; so called because under
   UNIX such devices have names of the form tty*.  Ambiguity between
   senses 2 and 3 is common but seldom bothersome.

<h1><a name="tunafish">tunafish</a></h1><pre> n.  In hackish lore, refers to the mutated
   punchline of an age-old joke to be found at the bottom of the
   manual pages of `tunefs(8)' in the original <a href="b.htm#bsd">BSD</a> 4.2
   distribution.  The joke was removed in later releases once
   commercial sites started using 4.2.  Tunefs relates to the
   `tuning' of file-system parameters for optimum performance, and
   at the bottom of a few pages of wizardly inscriptions was a `BUGS'
   section consisting of the line "You can tune a file system, but
   you can't tunafish".  Variants of this can be seen in other BSD
   versions, though it has been excised from some versions by
   humorless management <a href="d.htm#droid">droid</a>s.  The [nt]roff source for SunOS

<h1><a name="turing_tar-pit">Turing tar-pit</a></h1><pre> n.  1. A place where anything is possible but
   nothing of interest is practical.  Alan Turing helped lay the
   foundations of computer science by showing that all machines and
   languages capable of expressing a certain very primitive set of
   operations are logically equivalent in the kinds of computations
   they can carry out, and in principle have capabilities that differ
   only in speed from those of the most powerful and elegantly
   designed computers.  However, no machine or language exactly
   matching Turing's primitive set has ever been built (other than
   possibly as a classroom exercise), because it would be horribly
   slow and far too painful to use.  A `Turing tar-pit' is any
   computer language or other tool that shares this property.  That
   is, it's theoretically universal -- but in practice, the harder
   you struggle to get any real work done, the deeper its inadequacies
   suck you in.  Compare <a href="b.htm#bondage-and-discipline_language">bondage-and-discipline_language</a>.  2. The

<h1><a name="twenex">TWENEX</a></h1><pre>: n.  /twe'neks/ The TOPS-20 operating system by DEC
   -- the second proprietary OS for the PDP-10 -- preferred by most
   PDP-10 hackers over TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not
   <a href="i.htm#its">ITS</a> or <a href="w.htm#waits">WAITS</a> partisans).  TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt,
   Beranek & Newman's TENEX operating system using special paging
   hardware.  By the early 1970s, almost all of the systems on the
   ARPANET ran TENEX.  DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and
   began work to make it their own.  The first in-house code name for
   the operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System);
   when customers started asking questions, the name was changed to
   SNARK so DEC could truthfully deny that there was any project
   called VIROS.  When the name SNARK became known, the name was
   briefly reversed to become KRANS; this was quickly abandoned when
   someone objected that `krans' meant `funeral wreath' in Swedish
   (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply
   `wreath'; this part of the story may be apocryphal).  Ultimately
   DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it was
   as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The hacker community, mindful of
   its origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of `twenty
   TENEX'), even though by this point very little of the original
   TENEX code remained (analogously to the differences between AT&T V6
   UNIX and BSD).  DEC people cringed when they heard "TWENEX", but
   the term caught on nevertheless (the written abbreviation `20x'
   was also used).  TWENEX was successful and very popular; in fact,
   there was a period in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent
   a culture of partisans as UNIX or ITS -- but DEC's decision to
   scrap all the internal rivals to the VAX architecture and its
   relatively stodgy VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to
   TWENEX's brief day in the sun.  DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20
   users to convert to <a href="v.htm#vms">VMS</a>, but instead, by the late 1980s, most
   of the TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to UNIX.

<h1><a name="twiddle">twiddle</a></h1><pre> n.  1. Tilde (ASCII 1111110, `~').  Also called
   `squiggle', `sqiggle' (sic -- pronounced /skig'l/), and
   `twaddle', but twiddle is the most common term.  2. A small and
   insignificant change to a program.  Usually fixes one bug and
   generates several new ones (see also <a href="s.htm#shotgun_debugging">shotgun_debugging</a>).
   3. vt. To change something in a small way.  Bits, for example, are
   often twiddled.  Twiddling a switch or knob implies much less sense
   of purpose than toggling or tweaking it; see <a href="f.htm#frobnicate">frobnicate</a>.  To
   speak of twiddling a bit connotes aimlessness, and at best doesn't
   specify what you're doing to the bit; `toggling a bit' has a more
   specific meaning (see <a href="b.htm#bit_twiddling">bit_twiddling</a>, <a href="t.htm#toggle">toggle</a>).

<h1><a name="twilight_zone">twilight zone</a></h1><pre> n.   [IRC] Notionally, the area of
   cyberspace where <a href="i.htm#irc">IRC</a> operators live.  An <a href="o.htm#op">op</a> is said to
   have a "connection to the twilight zone".

<h1><a name="twink">twink</a></h1><pre> /twink/ n.  [UCSC] Equivalent to <a href="r.htm#read-only_user">read-only_user</a>
   .  Also reported on the Usenet group soc.motss; may derive
   from gay slang for a cute young thing with nothing upstairs
   (compare mainstream `chick').

<h1><a name="twirling_baton">twirling baton</a></h1><pre> n.  [PLATO] The overstrike sequence -/|\-/|\-
   which produces an animated twirling baton.  If you output it with a
   single backspace between characters, the baton spins in place.  If
   you output the sequence BS SP between characters, the baton spins
   from left to right.  If you output BS SP BS BS between characters,
   the baton spins from right to left.

   The twirling baton was a popular component of animated signature
   files on the pioneering PLATO educational timesharing system.  The
   `archie' Internet service is perhaps the best-known baton
   program today; it uses the twirling baton as an idler indicating
   that the program is working on a query.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="two-to-the-n">two-to-the-N</a></h1><pre> quant.  An amount much larger than <a href="n.htm#n">N</a> but
   smaller than <a href="i.htm#infinity">infinity</a>.  "I have 2-to-the-N things to
   do before I can go out for lunch" means you probably won't show
   up.

<h1><a name="twonkie">twonkie</a></h1><pre> /twon'kee/ n.  The software equivalent of a
   Twinkie (a variety of sugar-loaded junk food, or (in gay slang) the
   male equivalent of `chick'); a useless `feature' added to look
   sexy and placate a <a href="m.htm#marketroid">marketroid</a> (compare <a href="s.htm#saturday-night_special">Saturday-night_special</a>
   ).  The term may also be related to "The Twonky",
   title menace of a classic SF short story by Lewis Padgett (Henry
   Kuttner and C. L. Moore), first published in the September 1942
   "Astounding Science Fiction" and subsequently much
   anthologized.
