<h1><a name="ya-">YA-</a></h1><pre> abbrev.  [Yet Another] In hackish acronyms this almost
   invariably expands to <a href="y.htm#yet_another">Yet_Another</a>, following the precedent set
   by UNIX `yacc(1)' (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler).  See
   <a href="y.htm#yaba">YABA</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="yaba">YABA</a></h1><pre> /ya'b*/ n.  [Cambridge] Yet Another Bloody Acronym.
   Whenever some program is being named, someone invariably suggests
   that it be given a name that is acronymic.  The response from those
   with a trace of originality is to remark ironically that the
   proposed name would then be `YABA-compatible'.  Also used in
   response to questions like "What is WYSIWYG?"  See also
   <a href="t.htm#tla">TLA</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="yafiygi">YAFIYGI</a></h1><pre> /yaf'ee-y*-gee/ adj.  [coined in response to
   WYSIWYG] Describes the command-oriented ed/vi/nroff/TeX style of
   word processing or other user interface, the opposite of
   <a href="w.htm#wysiwyg">WYSIWYG</a>.  Stands for "You asked for it, you got it", because
   what you actually asked for is often not apparent until long after
   it is too late to do anything about it.  Used to denote perversity
   ("Real Programmers use YAFIYGI tools...and *like* it!")
   or, less often, a necessary tradeoff ("Only a YAFIYGI tool can
   have full programmable flexibility in its interface.").

   This precise sense of "You asked for it, you got it" seems to
   have first appeared in Ed Post's classic parody "Real
   Programmers don't use Pascal"; the acronym is a more recent (as of
   1993) invention.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="yaun">YAUN</a></h1><pre> /yawn/ n.  [Acronym for `Yet Another UNIX Nerd']
   Reported from the San Diego Computer Society (predominantly a
   microcomputer users' group) as a good-natured punning insult aimed
   at UNIX zealots.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="yellow_book">Yellow Book</a></h1><pre> n.  [proposed] The print version of this Jargon
   File; "The New Hacker's Dictionary", MIT Press, 1991 (ISBN
   0-262-68069-6).  Includes all the material in the 2.9.6 version of
   the File, plus a Foreword by Guy L. Steele Jr. and a Preface by
   Eric S. Raymond.  Most importantly, the book version is nicely
   typeset and includes almost all of the infamous Crunchly cartoons
   by the Great Quux, each attached to an appropriate entry.  The
   second edition corresponds to the Jargon File 3.0.0.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="yellow_wire">yellow wire</a></h1><pre> n.  [IBM] Repair wires used when connectors
   (especially ribbon connectors) got broken due to some schlemiel
   pinching them, or to reconnect cut traces after the FE mistakenly
   cut one.  Compare <a href="b.htm#blue_wire">blue_wire</a>, <a href="p.htm#purple_wire">purple_wire</a>, <a href="r.htm#red_wire">red_wire</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="yet_another">Yet Another</a></h1><pre> adj.  [From UNIX's `yacc(1)', `Yet
   Another Compiler-Compiler', a LALR parser generator] 1. Of your own
   work: A humorous allusion often used in titles to acknowledge that
   the topic is not original, though the content is.  As in `Yet
   Another AI Group' or `Yet Another Simulated Annealing Algorithm'.
   2. Of others' work: Describes something of which there are already
   far too many.  See also <a href="y.htm#ya-">YA-</a>, <a href="y.htm#yaba">YABA</a>, <a href="y.htm#yaun">YAUN</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ykybhtlw">YKYBHTLW</a></h1><pre> abbrev. //  Abbreviation of `You know you've been
   hacking too long when...', which became established on the Usenet
   group alt.folklore.computers during extended discussion of the
   indicated entry in the Jargon File.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="ymmv">YMMV</a></h1><pre> cav.  Written-only abbreviation for <a href="y.htm#your_mileage_may_vary">Your_mileage_may_vary</a>
   .

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="you_are_not_expected_to_understand_this">You are not expected to understand this</a></h1><pre> [UNIX] cav.  The
   canonical comment describing something <a href="m.htm#magic">magic</a> or too
   complicated to bother explaining properly.  From an infamous
   comment in the context-switching code of the V6 UNIX kernel.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="you_know_you've_been_hacking_too_long_when...">You know you've been hacking too long when...</a></h1><pre>  The
   set-up line for a genre of one-liners told by hackers about
   themselves.  These include the following:

   *    not only do you check your email more often than your paper
        mail, but you remember your <a href="n.htm#network_address">network_address</a> faster than your
        postal one.
   *    your <a href="s.htm#so">SO</a> kisses you on the neck and the first thing you
        think is "Uh, oh, <a href="p.htm#priority_interrupt">priority_interrupt</a>."
   *    you go to balance your checkbook and discover that you're
        doing it in octal.
   *    your computers have a higher street value than your car.
   *    in your universe, `round numbers' are powers of 2, not 10.
   *    more than once, you have woken up recalling a dream in
        some programming language.
   *    you realize you have never seen half of your best friends.

   [An early version of this entry said "All but one of these
   have been reliably reported as hacker traits (some of them quite
   often).  Even hackers may have trouble spotting the ringer."  The
   ringer was balancing one's checkbook in octal, which I made up out
   of whole cloth.  Although more respondents picked that one
   out as fiction than any of the others, I also received multiple
   independent reports of its actually happening, most famously
   to Grace Hopper while she was working with BINAC in 1949. -- ESR]

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="your_mileage_may_vary">Your mileage may vary</a></h1><pre> cav.  [from the standard disclaimer
   attached to EPA mileage ratings by American car manufacturers] 1. A
   ritual warning often found in UNIX freeware distributions.
   Translates roughly as "Hey, I tried to write this portably, but
   who *knows* what'll happen on your system?"  2. More
   generally, a qualifier attached to advice.  "I find that sending
   flowers works well, but your mileage may vary."

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="yow!">Yow!</a></h1><pre> /yow/ interj.  [from "Zippy the Pinhead" comix] A
   favored hacker expression of humorous surprise or emphasis.  "Yow!
   Check out what happens when you twiddle the foo option on this
   display hack!"  Compare <a href="g.htm#gurfle">gurfle</a>.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="yoyo_mode">yoyo mode</a></h1><pre> n.  The state in which the system is said to be
   when it rapidly alternates several times between being up and being
   down.  Interestingly (and perhaps not by coincidence), many
   hardware vendors give out free yoyos at Usenix exhibits.

   Sun Microsystems gave out logoized yoyos at SIGPLAN '88.  Tourists
   staying at one of Atlanta's most respectable hotels were
   subsequently treated to the sight of 200 of the country's top
   computer scientists testing yo-yo algorithms in the lobby.

</pre><p>
<h1><a name="yu-shiang_whole_fish">Yu-Shiang Whole Fish</a></h1><pre> /yoo-shyang hohl fish/ n.,obs.  The
   character gamma (extended SAIL ASCII 0001001), which with a loop in
   its tail looks like a little fish swimming down the page.  The term
   is actually the name of a Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked
   whole (not <a href="p.htm#parse">parse</a>d) and covered with Yu-Shiang (or Yu-Hsiang)
   sauce.  Usage: primarily by people on the MIT LISP Machine, which
   could display this character on the screen.  Tends to elicit
   incredulity from people who hear about it second-hand.
