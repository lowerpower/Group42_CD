Clarence Darrow is best known for defending the right
to teach evolution in "the Scopes trial." Not so well-
known is his lifetime of service on behalf of victims
of government persecution. In RESIST NOT EVIL, Darrow
presents a convincing case for abolishing the criminal
justice system. Darrow argues that neither punishment
nor prison reduce the crime rate, and the only reason
for them is vengeance and cruelty. He points out that
most crimes are committed against property by people
who have been shut out of the economic system. This
reprint of Darrow's controversial essay could not be
more timely; his ideas have lost none of their fire or
relevance.
