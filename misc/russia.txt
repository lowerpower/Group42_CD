  The United States of America and His Majesty the Emperor of all           
the Russias, being desirous of strengthening, if possible, the good

  And the said Plenipotentiaries, having exchanged their full               
powers, which were found to be in due form, have agreed upon and            
signed the following articles:                                              
-                                                                           
                            ARTICLE I                                       
-                                                                           
  His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, agrees to cede to the         
United States, by this convention, immediately upon the exchange of         
the ratifications thereof, all the territory and dominion now               
possessed by his said Majesty on the continent of America and in            
adjacent islands, the same being contained within the geographical          
limits herein set forth, to wit: The eastern limit is the line of           
demarcation between the Russian and the British possessions in North        
America, as established by the convention between Russia and Great          
Britain, of February 28-16, 1825, and described in Articles III and IV      
of said convention, in the following terms:                                 
  "III Commencing from the southernmost point of the island called          
Prince of Wales Island, which point lies in the parallel of 54 degrees      
40 minutes north latitude, and between the 131st and 133d degree of         
west longitude (meridian of Greenwich), the said line shall ascend          
to the north along the channel called Portland Channel, as far as           
the point of the continent where it strikes the 56th degree of north        
latitude; from this last-mentioned point, the line of demarcation           
shall follow the summit of the mountains situated parallel to the           
coast, as far as the point of intersection of the 141st degree of west      
longitude (of the same meridian); and finally, from the said point          
of intersection, the said meridian line of the 141st degree, in its         
prolongation as far as the Frozen Ocean.                                    
  "IV With reference to the line of demarcation laid down in the            
preceding article, it is understood-                                        
  "1st That the island called Prince of Wales Island shall belong           
wholly to Russia" (now, by this cession to the United States"               
  "2d That whenever the summit of the mountains which extend in a           
direction parallel to the coast, from the 56th degree of north              
latitude to the point of intersection of the 141st degree of west           
longitude, shall prove to be at the distance of more than ten marine        
leagues from -the ocean, the limit between the British possessions and      
the line of coast which is to belong to Russia as above mentioned           
(that is to say, the limit to the possessions ceded by this                 
convention), shall be formed by a line parallel to the winding of           
the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine          
leagues therefrom."                                                         
  The western limit within which the territories and dominion conveyed      
are contained passes through a point in Behring's Straits on the            
parallel of sixty-five degrees thirty minutes north latitude, at its        
intersection by the meridian which passes midway between the islands        
of Krusenstern or Ignalook, and the island of Ratmanoff, or                 
Noonarbook, and proceeds due north without limitation, into the same        
Frozen Ocean. The same western limit, beginning at the same initial         
point, proceeds thence in a course nearly southwest, through Behring's      
Straits and Behring's Sea, so as to pass midway between the                 
northwest point of the island of St. Lawrence and the southeast             
point of Cape Choukotski, to the meridian of one hundred and                
seventy-two west longitude; thence, from the intersection of that           
meridian, in a southwesterly direction, as to pass midway between           
the island of Attou and the Copper Island of the Kormandorski               
coupler or group, in the North Pacific Ocean, to the meridian of one        
hundred and ninety-three degrees west longitude, so as to include in        
the territory conveyed the whole of the Aleutian Islands east of            
that meridian.                                                              
-                                                                           
                           ARTICLE II                                       
-                                                                           
  In the cession of territory and dominion made by the preceding            
article, are included the right of property in all public lots and          
squares, vacant lands, and all public buildings, fortifications,            
barracks, and other edifices which are not private individual               
property. It is, however, understood and agreed, that the churches          
which have been built in the ceded territory by the Russian                 
Government, shall remain the property of such members of the Greek          
Oriental Church resident in the territory as may choose to worship          
therein. Any Government archives, papers, and documents relative to         
the territory and dominion aforesaid, which may now be existing there,      
will be left the possession of the agent of the United States; but          
an authenticated copy of such of them as may be required, will be,          
at all times, given by the United States to the Russian Government, or      
to such Russian officers or subjects as they may apply for.                 
-                                                                           
                          ARTICLE III                                       
-                                                                           
  The inhabitants of the ceded territory, according to their choice,        
reserving their natural allegiance, may return to Russia within             
three years; but if they should prefer to remain in the ceded               
territory, they, with the exception of uncivilized native tribes,           
shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages,           
and immunities of citizens of the United States, and shall be               
maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty,            
property, and religion.The uncivilized tribes will be subject to            
such laws and regulations as the United Statesmay from time to time         
adopt in regard to aboriginal tribes of that country.                       
-                                                                           
                           ARTICLE IV                                       
-                                                                           
  His Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, shall appoint, with          
convenient despatch, an agent or agents for the purpose of formally         
delivering to a similar agent or agents, appointed on behalf of the         
United States, the territory, dominion, property, dependencies, and         
appurtenances which are ceded as above, and for doing any other act         
which may be necessary in regard thereto. But the cession, with the         
right of immediate possession, is nevertheless to be deemed complete        
and absolute on the exchange of ratifications, without waiting for          
such formal delivery.                                                       
-                                                                           
                            ARTICLE V

  Immediately after the exchange of the ratifications of this               
convention, any fortifications or military posts which may be in the
