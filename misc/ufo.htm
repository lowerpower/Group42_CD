<b><a name="Arnold">ARNOLD, KENNETH</a></b> On 24th June 1947, pilot
Kenneth Arnold observed nine boomerang-shaped craft flying over the
Cascade Mountains in Washington - the sighting which gave <a

<b><a name="Bennewitz">BENNEWITZ, PAUL</a></b> In the late 1970's, an
Alberquerque businessman named Paul Bennewitz started to monitor
unusual electromagnetic pulses from what he thought were UFOs flying
above the nearby Manzano Nuclear Weapons Storage Facility near
Kirtland Air Force Base. He came to the conclusion that these pulses
_may_ be controlling implanted abductees, so he started attempting to
decode the pulses, and thought he was on the right path. He contacted
<a href="#APRO">APRO</a> about his theory, but they wouldn't believe
him, so he contacted AFOSI in October 1980, where he was put in touch
with <a href="#Doty">RICHARD DOTY.</a> He filled out a few forms and
sent in some tape he had filmed of some UFOs over the Nuclear Storage
Facility and Doty started to feed Bennewitz <a
href="#Disinformation">DISINFORMATION</a> about the US government's
involvement with the UFO phenomenon, including tales of US/alien
pacts, alien bases in various places around the world, and of
experiments that the aliens carried out with humans to create hybrids
and androids. Bennewitz believed all of it. Doty then got <a
href="#Moore">WILLIAM MOORE</a> to pass on more disinformation on to
him, and Bennewitz got more and more paranoid and eventually went
insane. Bennewitz told <a href="#Lear">JOHN LEAR</a> what he had heard
and Lear took this into account when he wrote his <a

<b><a name="Cash-Landrum">CASH/LANDRUM CASE</a></b> In December 1980,
Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum and her grandson Colby Landrum, were
driving along a road in Huffman, Texas when they saw a bright light in
the sky. After driving a little more along the road, they came across
a large diamond shaped UFO hovering over the road belching fire out of
the bottom. Since the flames were blocking the road, they had to stop
the car about 65 yards away from the craft and the three of them got
out. Vickie and Colby stayed by the car, whereas Betty went on to get
a closer look. She spent a long time gazing at it and her skin began
to burn because of the heat from the flames. She returned to the car
when the object began to rise and a large number of unmarked black
helicopters chased after the UFO.  When they got home, they started
suffering from sunburn, diarrhoea and vomiting. It has been claimed
that the craft was a US attempt at making a UFO since it was spewing
out flames at the bottom and was joined by many helicopters later on
(See <a href="#Projects">PROJECT SNOWBIRD</a>).<p>

<b><a name="Cattle-Mutilations">CATTLE MUTILATIONS</a></b> A
world-wide problem, cattle are killed and the body is left on the farm
in various conditions. On studying the body, it has been found that
the body has been _totally_ drained of blood and that there has been
no trace of blood found anywhere on the ground around the body.
Various incisions would also be found on the body that were so clear
cut that they would have had to have been done with some sort of laser
technology that we didn't have when the mutilations started (before
1970). Bones were also clearly cut with no bone fragments around the
cut. The bodies would be missing various parts which had also shown to
have been removed with accurate precision.  UFOs have been linked with
these mutilations since they have been sighted at the same time in the
same area where the mutilated bodies have been found.<p>

<b><a name="Condon-Report">CONDON REPORT</a></b> The result of an
investigation into <a href="#Projects">PROJECT BLUE BOOK</a> in 1969
by Dr Edward Condon. He started the investigation saying that all UFOs
are "bunk", people who believed in them were "kooks", the authors of
UFO books should be "horsewhipped" and that Blue Book was a waste of
time. As a consequence, the report concluded that all UFO sightings
were explainable and that UFOs didn't pose a defence threat.<p>

<b><a name="Condor">"CONDOR"</a></b> Also known as Robert Collins who
took part in a <a href="#Disinformation">DISINFORMATION</a> program
with <a href="#Moore">WILLIAM MOORE</a> and <a href="#Doty">RICHARD
DOTY</a> against <a href="#Bennewitz">PAUL BENNEWITZ.</a><p>

<b><a name="Cooper">COOPER, MILTON WILLIAM</a></b> Known as Bill
Cooper, this is one man who the UFO community does not trust anymore.
He used to work for the US Air Force and claims to have then moved on
into Naval Intelligence. He made his debut on <a
href="#Paranet">PARANET</a> with a report on a UFO sighting he had
whilst on the USS Tiru, a US Naval submarine.  That report was
accepted in good faith. He then began to send in details about various
secret projects that he alleged the US governments were involved in
during his time in intelligence. When asked for evidence to back his
claims up by UFO researchers, he replied abusively. His reports
continued to be sent in and the researchers still questioned him about
backup evidence.  Eventually he was barred from Paranet. He still
wrote the reports and sent them into various bulletin boards
anonymously, this time accusing the UFO researchers that questioned
his authenticity as people who are working for the government to
spread <a href="#Disinformation">DISINFORMATION</a> to the public.
Bill Cooper is now a highly paid lecturer who lectures about his
"experiences" and also claims that JFK was assassinated by the driver
of the car because he wanted to make details about UFOs public and
that we had bases on the Moon and on Mars built in the 1950's.
Evidence : none for the bases and a seventh generation copy of the
film showing the assassination that is very bad quality. He also
claims that the aliens in US TV series "Alien Nation" are real aliens
who were employed as part of an indoctrination program so that the
public will accept the reality of aliens more easily. Bill Cooper's
sources for his hypothesis is a mixture of the claims of <a
href="#Bennewitz">PAUL BENNEWITZ</a>, <a href="#Moore">BILL MOORE</a>,
<a href="#Lear">JOHN LEAR</a> and <a href="#Lazar">BOB LAZAR</a> and
added a few unfounded theories he invented himself. When Bob Lazar was
on a phone-in in 1989 ("Billy Goodman's Happening", 21/11/89) whilst
he was going public, Cooper called in and said that he had talked to
Lazar for over a year and that he had checked out his claims and they
are all genuine. Then, some months later, Cooper changes his mind and
says that Lazar is a fraud and had always known he was a fraud ever
since he first went public. This is just one example of the many
U-turns and inconsistencies that Cooper has carried out over the
years.<p>

<b><a name="CUFOS">CUFOS</a></b> The Centre for UFO Studies was
founded in 1973 by Dr J. Allen Hynek four years after his work at <a
href="#Projects">PROJECT BLUE BOOK</a> ended. It publishes the
bi-monthly journal <a href="#IUR">"INTERNATIONAL UFO REPORTER"</a> and
an annual <a href="#JUOFS">"JOURNAL OF UFO STUDIES".</a><p>

<b><a name="Dark-Side">DARK SIDE HYPOTHESIS</a></b> This is a brief
run-through of <a href="#Lear">JOHN LEAR</a>'s Dark Side Hypothesis :
Dozens of flying saucers have crashed over the years and the US
government has recovered all of them and launched Project Redlight in
1962 whose aims were to discover how to fly these recovered craft and
was carried out in <a href="#S4">S-4</a> at <a href="#Area-51">AREA
51.</a> Lear claims that this area is no longer in US control, the
aliens have taken over the area. The US government then made a deal
with the aliens in which the aliens could control a segment of S-4 and
abduct as many people as they want, in return for their technology and
that they provided a list of people that they intended to abduct. In
1973, the US government discovered that the aliens were abducting more
people than they had listed and there was a confrontation and in
1978/9 the aliens held and then killed 44 top scientists and some of
the Delta Force troops sent in to rescue them.  The deal was then
broken but the aliens stayed and were abducting as many as 1 in 10
Americans to use in experiments, mutilating these abductees and
producing androids in underground laboratories. Sometime in the 1980's
the US government and the aliens got together again and are working
together so that the US can gain some more alien technology. Lear
claims that there is a secret US government that is overseeing the
abductions and that the abductees have implants in them that control
them so that when an ideal time came, the secret government could
enslave them and control them via drug addiction. The head of the
secret government would be MJ-12. Lear's sources were <a
href="#Bennewitz">PAUL BENNEWITZ,</a> <a href="#Lazar">BOB LAZAR</a>
and, later on, <a href="#Cooper">BILL COOPER.</a> When Bob Lazar went
public on US TV in 1989, he said that he did not believe any of Lear's
claims and distanced himself from Lear and any of his associates.<p>

<b><a name="Disinformation">DISINFORMATION</a></b> A strategy used by
the governments of the world to cover up any knowledge they have of
UFOs. Disinformation is when a person or organisation lies to a person
by knowingly giving him or her fake documents or telling them false
"facts".<p>

<b><a name="Doty">DOTY, RICHARD</a></b> The AFOSI Special Agent who
fed <a href="#Bennewitz">PAUL BENNEWITZ</a> <a
href="#Disinformation">DISINFORMATION</a> and employed <a
href="#Moore">WILLIAM MOORE</a> to feed Bennewitz more information and
to spy on various prominent ufologists. Doty was given the code name
<a href="#Falcon">"FALCON"</a> by Moore when they both appeared with
<a href="#Condor">"CONDOR"</a> on "UFO Cover-Up...Live" in the US. The
show was a big embarrassment to the UFO community when they claimed
that <a href="#EBE">EBE</a>'s were living in secret hideaways and like
strawberry ice cream and Tibetan music.<p>

<b><a name="ET">ET</a></b> Extra-terrestrial. A term used to refer to

<b><a name="ET-Exposure">ET EXPOSURE LAW</a></b> In July 1969, the ET
Exposure Law was added to US law without public debate, a law that
prohibits anyone to come into contact with a UFO or any aliens. If a
person breaks this law, he/she can be fined up to $5000 and be jailed
for up to a year. On top of that, a NASA administrator is empowered to
determine, with or without a hearing, if a person has been
"extra-terrestrially exposed" and can impose that the person can be
locked up in quarantine under armed guard for _any_ period of time.
The decision cannot be reversed, not even by a court order, making the
law completely against the American Constitution. The law also
effectively makes anyone involved in a <a
href="#Close-Encounter">CLOSE ENCOUNTER</a> a criminal.  Since the law
is in Title 14, Section 1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations, very
few people know about it since you would have had to have gone through
at least 1210 other laws in the book to find it.<p>

<b><a name="Flying-Saucer">FLYING SAUCER</a></b> When Kenneth Arnold
reported his 1947 daylight sighting of nine boomerang-shaped UFOs over
the north west of the USA, a newspaper covered the story and called
the crafts "flying saucers" because Arnold said that their movements
were similar to that of a saucer skipping across the surface of a lake
despite the fact that the UFOs weren't saucer-shaped. The name
stuck.<p>

<b><a name="FSR">"FLYING SAUCER REVIEW"</a></b> The longest running
UFO journal in existence, running since the 1950's. Unfortunately not
the authoritative journal it used to be in its heyday due to changes
of editors. The current editor, Gordon Creighton believes that we are
all being controlled by alien forces of some sort and that we can do
nothing to stop them. He is also convinced that a significant
percentage of the Earth's population is half-alien-half-human, and
some people are completely alien.<p>

<b><a name="FOIA">FOIA</a></b> Freedom of Information Act. This is an
American law that allows members of the public to obtain copies of
classified documents by having all or parts of the documents
declassified by order of a federal judge. The judge may refuse the
declassification of a document if it is necessary for the document to
remain classified because it affects national security. At least, that
is in theory. In practice it has been very unreliable, if one group
requests for a set of documents and gets them, it doesn't necessarily
mean that a second group will be able to get them. If the government
denies they've got the documents that you are looking for, they may
not be telling the truth. It has been known for a government to deny
that it has _any_ documents on an incident yet they release some a few
months later.<p>


<b><a name="Foo">FOO FIGHTERS</a></b> Shiny metallic-looking sphere
seen floating in the skies in World War II from 1943 onwards. After
the war, neither side claimed to have sent them up there. The
Americans called them "foo fighters", a term derived from a
comic-strip phrase "Where there's foo, there's fire."<p>

<i>--G--</i><p>

<b><a name="Ghost">GHOST ROCKETS</a></b> In 1946, over two thousand
UFOs were observed flying above Scandinavia. They looked like missiles
with a flame exhaust at one end, but travelled at varying speeds (from
very fast to fairly slow) and performed various exotic manoeuvres at
these speeds. There were reports at the time that some had landed and
exploded. Neither East nor West admitted launching these rockets.
Western scientists analysed fragments from these missiles and said
that they were made of an organic substance that resembled carbide.
When a Greek investigation publicly announced in 1967 that these were
not missiles, the investigation was ordered to close by the Army and
further information was covered in a blanket of secrecy.<p>

<b><a name="Greys">GREYS</a></b> The most common type of alien seen in <a
href="#Close-Encounter">CLOSE ENCOUNTER</a> cases.  Height varies from
two feet to five feet, are humanoid, and usually have black bug-like
eyes, little or no nose and a small slit for a mouth.<p>

<b><a name="Good-T">GOOD, TIMOTHY</a></b> Author of best selling books
"Above Top Secret", "Alien Liaison", "Alien Update" and the "UFO
Report" series. "Above Top Secret" documented the worldwide government
cover-up of UFO related material and incidents. It also published the
faked MJ-12 briefing document. Despite that, it is widely regarded as
_the_ book to read if you're seriously interested in UFOs.  "Alien
Liaison" went one step further by dealing with disinformation, <a
href="#Cattle-Mutilations">CATTLE MUTILATIONS</a> and the ROBERT LAZAR
case, but is thought of as fairly unreliable since parts of it were
heavily influenced by the claims in the <a href="#MJ-12">MJ-12</a>
documents, the claims of <a href="#Moore">BILL MOORE,</a> and also the
claims of <a href="#Oeschler">BOB OESCHLER</a> that he worked on a top
secret project to produce an exhibition called "Cosmic Journey" in
which the US government was allegedly going to display a preserved
alien body and a section of a UFO. "Alien Update" can be thought of as
"UFO Report 1993" since it is in exactly the same format as the other
books in the "UFO Report" series.<p>

<b><a name="Gulf-Breeze">GULF BREEZE SIGHTINGS</a></b> A series of UFO
sightings in Gulf Breeze, Florida that have taken place since 1987,
but the most concentrated period of sightings was between November
1987 and May 1988 and were centred around Ed and Frances Walters.
During this period, Ed claims that aliens have attempted to abduct
both him and his wife using a blue ray, but failed. He also claims
that he knew when another encounter with a UFO was imminent because he
would feel a humming noise in his head. When he got this humming
noise, he would rush out with his camera and would take a picture of
the UFO which would be waiting for him in the sky.  The Walters took a
total of forty photos with various cameras over that period and all of
them were evaluated by various scientists and were proved that they
were not faked. The most impressive photos included a blue ray that
was used to transport people to and from the UFOs, a UFO photographed
that was partially obscured by a tree (very hard to fake) and also the
same UFO hovering above a highway with a reflection on the road of the
bright light on the underside of the UFO.<p>

<b><a name="Hill-Abduct">HILL ABDUCTION CASE</a></b> A controversial
abduction case, controversial because it all hinges on information
gained by performing <a href="#Hypnotic">HYPNOTIC REGRESSION</a> on
Betty and Barney Hill. In September 1961, the Hills were returning
from a holiday and were driving along a New Hampshire road when they
saw a bright light moving rapidly in the sky. They stopped the car and
got out to have a closer look with binoculars. The light then reversed
its direction and the couple got back into their car and drove on. The
light then turned back and approached their car, so they stopped again
to look at it.  The craft was coin shaped with blue lighted windows
along the edge, through which they saw figures running about. Barney
walked over the road to get an even better look when two wings came
out of either side of the craft which had red lights on the wing tips.
He then got shocked and _very_ agitated and ran back into the car and
the two of them went back on their journey home. When they got back,
they realised that they were some two hours late and they didn't know
why.  After a few days, Betty had a series of disturbing dreams
relating to a possible UFO abduction, so she and Barney agreed to go
under hypnotic regression to try and find out just _what_ happened
during those two lost hours. The two were sent into a hypnotic sleep
both together and separately, and both stories matched up with each
other for the times when they were together during the UFO incident.
The story went like this: When the Hills stopped the car the second
time, it was because it was stalled by the UFO. The two were helped
out of their car by a few men (alien men) and were taken off of the
road and up a ramp into the UFO. They were then separated and put into
different rooms where they underwent an examination involving taking
samples from various areas of the body. Before being joined together
and being allowed to leave, Betty was shown a three-dimensional
holographic star map and was able to draw it out after a regression
session. An amateur astronomer took the drawing of the star map and
searched through the near stars to see if she could get a match for
the star configuration drawn by Betty. After another five years of
searching, she found one, and therefore calculated that the aliens
must have come from the  <a href="#Zeta-Ret">ZETA RETICULI</a> system.<p>


<b><a name="Hynek-Classification">HYNEK CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM</a></b> 
A system used to categorize the various types of
UFO sightings invented by Dr J. Allen Hynek. The categories are as
follows...
<ul> 
<li>NOCTURNAL LIGHT   Any anomalous light(s) seen in the night sky whose 
description rules out the possibilities of aircraft lights, stars, meteors and
the like.
<li>DAYLIGHT DISK   UFOs seen in the distant daytime sky. The UFOs classed 
in this category can be other shapes as well, like cigars, eggs and ovals.
<li>RADAR-VISUALS   Where UFOs are tracked on radar and can be seen at the 
place illustrated at the same time.
<li>CLOSE ENCOUNTERS...
<ul>
<li>OF THE FIRST KIND (CEI)  A UFO in close proximity (within approx 
500 feet) of the witness.
<li>OF THE SECOND KIND (CEII)  A UFO that leaves markings on the
ground, causes burns or paralysis to humans, frightens animals, interferes with
car engines or TV and radio reception.
<li>OF THE THIRD KIND (CEIII)   A CEI or CEII which have visible 
occupants.  
</ul>
</ul>
	There are also two more unofficial classes of Close Encounter...
<ul>
<li>	    OF THE FOURTH KIND (CEIV)   Abduction cases.
<li>	    OF THE FIFTH KIND (CEV)   Communication occurs between a person and

<b><a name="Hypnotic">HYPNOTIC REGRESSION</a></b> There is a theory
that everything you see and hear is stored into the subconscious
memory, and that it is possible to recount experiences via the use of
hypnotic regression, in which the person is sent into a trance and
re-enacts the experience. However, such a tool is very unreliable
since they could be thinking about something else or mix two different
experiences together. Another problem with hypnotic regression is
interpreting what is recounted. In a non-UFO related case, an English
girl was sent into a hypnotic state and started to talk non-stop in
French. What she said was recorded and the investigator concluded that
the girl must have been French in a past life. This theory was readily
accepted until someone read the transcription of what the girl had
said and found that it was an _exact_ copy of a French text she had
read. It has also been found that pathological liars can lie whilst
under hypnosis.<p>

<b><a name="Lazar">LAZAR, ROBERT SCOTT</a></b> Robert Lazar is a
scientist with two masters degrees, one in physics, the other in
electronics. He wrote his thesis on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). He has
worked in Los Alamos as a technician and then as a physicist in the
Polarized Proton Section dealing with particle accelerators. In his
spare time, he has built a jet powered car _and_ a jet powered
motorbike (max. speed 350mph!), as well as a car capable of running
off of hydrogen. In March 1989, Lazar appeared on KLAS-TV in the US
claiming to have worked in an above Top Secret installation known as
<a href="#S4">S-4,</a> ten miles south of <a href="#Area-51">AREA
51</a> in the Nevada desert. He was a scientist who was employed
between December 1988 and April 1989 to examine a captured flying
saucer to try and reverse engineer the saucer's propulsion mechanism.
He claims that there were nine different saucers at <a
href="#S-4">S-4</a>, although he was only working on one of them.  He
was told that the crafts used a propulsion system that uses gravity
waves, a theory that mainstream science hasn't discovered yet
(scientists don't know what gravity actually _is_, there are many
theories, but there hasn't been one that is universally accepted yet)
and the energy needed is supplied by irradiating Element 115, an
element not found on Earth and which cannot be synthesized. A kilogram
of the element releases the same amount of energy as 47 10-megaton
hydrogen bombs. He says that he had 500 pounds (227.27kg) of the
element to work with, but each craft only needed 223 grams of the
element. Whilst working on one of the craft, he was allowed to
actually go inside the craft and he was also present at a test flight
in which the craft underwent a few simple manoeuvres in the air. When
he went public in March 1989, he appeared on US TV in shadow with his
voice altered, under the pseudonym "Dennis", an inside joke since his
boss at S-4 was called Dennis Mariani, in an attempt to remain
anonymous. On 29/3/89 he took three of his friends, one of them John
Lear, to the edge of S-4 to observe any UFO test flights through a
telescope. They saw (and filmed) a bright light rise in a step
manoeuvre, that is, it would hover in the air, briefly disappear and
reappear a few feet higher, and then the light went down in the same
way. When they went again the following week on 6/4/89, they were
caught by a security guard. Their ID details were recorded on a
computer in Area 51 and they were ordered to leave the area, despite
it being public land. They did leave and the following day, Lazar was
ordered to go to Area 51 for a meeting with some security guards and
an FBI agent. It was then that he resigned and left. After he was
fired at whilst travelling on an Interstate highway, he decided that
he'd better go public on TV under his own name, the theory being that
if anyone kills him after going completely public, then that action
would prove that he was telling the truth. He went on TV to tell the
full story in November 1989 and his story has (to my knowledge)
remained consistent since then.<p>

<b><a name="Lear">LEAR, JOHN</a></b> The estranged son of Bill Lear,
inventor of the Lear Jet.  John Lear is the only pilot who holds every
airman certificate awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration. He
has flown over 160 different type of aircraft and had flown many
missions for the CIA. He is a friend of <a href="#Bennewitz">PAUL
BENNEWITZ</a> who told Lear everything that he had heard from <a
href="#Doty">RICHARD DOTY</a> and <a href="#Moore">WILLIAM MOORE</a>
and Lear believed most of it. Lear was also a friend of <a
href="#Lazar">ROBERT LAZAR</a> who told him about the various goings
on at <a href="#Area-51">AREA 51</a>; Moore showed him the various
documents he had been given by Doty, and from those three sources
began work on his Lear Hypothesis, also known as the <a
href="#Dark-Side">DARK SIDE HYPOTHESIS.</a> He then subscribed to
Paranet and found a friend in <a href="#Cooper">BILL COOPER.</a> With
Cooper's help, he finished his hypothesis and sent it to the Paranet
Bulletin Board. He then decided to test the UFO society by faking some
government documents about aliens, the Krlll (pronounced "Krill")
Files. All of the UFO society (but one) checked out the material
included in the files and found large inconsistencies and lies. The
one person who didn't was Cooper, who claimed to have seen the
documents when he was working for the government. When the files were
declared as faked, Lear and Cooper were barred from Paranet and the
friendship between them broke down, Cooper accusing Lear of being a
government agent. Lear is now lecturing about his Hypothesis.<p>

There are allegedly over thirty compartments of Top Secret which means
that if you have a Top Secret clearance, it doesn't mean that you have
access to all Top Secret documents, you must require the "need to
know". Documents that require the "need to know" are classified as Top

<b><a name="Missing">MISSING TIME</a></b> Some people say that when

of missing time.<p>

<b><a name="MJ-12">MJ-12</a></b> The MJ-12 (standing for "Majestic
Twelve") mystery was sparked off with the 1987 publication of an
alleged briefing document from ex-US President Truman to
President-Elect Eisenhower in November 1953.  The document dealt with
government knowledge about UFOs, aliens, and above Top Secret
projects. It listed the twelve members as Dr Lloyd Berkner, Dr Detlev
Bronk, Dr Vannevar Bush, James Forrestal, Gordon Gray, Vice Admiral
Roscoe Hillenkoetter, Dr Jerome Hunsaker, Dr Donald Menzel, General
Robert Montague, Rear Admiral Sidney Souers, General Nathan Twining
and General Hoyt Vandenberg. James Forrestal had a mental breakdown
and committed suicide in 1949 and was replaced by General Walter
Smith. MJ-12 (also known as Majic-12, Majority-12, Majesty-12) is
allegedly a Top Secret research and development/intelligence operation
set up by and answerable to the US President. All thirteen members had
died by the time the briefing document was publicised, so none of the
details could be checked out.  What could be verified was the
document's authenticity, and when it was found that the signature on
the briefing document was identical in ratio to a 1947 memo from
President Truman to Vannevar Bush and the briefing document was proved
to be a fake. However the MJ-12 controversy still rumbled on with
people saying that although the document has been proved to be a piece
of <a href="#Disinformation">DISINFORMATION</a>, parts of it must therefore be true. The document
touched upon the <a href="#Roswell">ROSWELL CASE</a>, as well as <a href="#Projects">PROJECTS SIGN, GRUDGE and
BLUE BOOK</a> and <a href="#Arnold">KENNETH ARNOLD</a>'s sighting of nine flying saucers, all of
which have been proved to be true by UFO researchers. Ufologists were
split as to whether there _ever_was_ a Majestic 12.  When <a href="#Lazar">ROBERT LAZAR</a>
revealed that his work was classified as <a href="#Majestic">MAJESTIC,</a> it added weight to
the opinion that there may have indeed been such an organisation.
Opinions differ as to what MJ-12 could be if it exists, some say it
was a simple committee that evaluated the UFO reports that were
siphoned out of <a href="#Projects">PROJECT BLUE BOOK</a>, while others say that they are
running the CIA, FBI, the world's drugs market and are planning to
take over the world and rule in partnership with the <a href="#Greys">GREYS.</a><p>

<b><a name="Moore">MOORE, WILLIAM</a></b> Moore is an ex-teacher who
chose to go into the writing profession in 1979 and was very involved
in an investigation of the 1947 <a href="#Roswell">ROSWELL CASE</a>.
He worked with APRO for a while before accepting a place on the APRO
board. He learnt about <a href="#Bennewitz">PAUL BENNEWITZ</a>'s
claims from fellow board member Jim Lorenzen, but didn't take too
great an interest in the case. Whilst he was on a promotional radio
show tour promoting his new book "The Roswell Incident", he received
phone calls, at two different radio stations, from a nearby Air Force
Base sergeant who wanted to meet him. When the first call came, he was
too busy, but after the second call, they arranged a meeting and there
he met <a href="#Doty">RICHARD DOTY.</a> Doty told him that he (and
nine other military people, all ten identified by names of birds)
would tell him various "facts" of what the US government was up to in
regard to UFOs if he spied on <a href="#APRO">APRO</a> and passed <a
href="#Disinformation">DISINFORMATION</a> on to Paul Bennewitz. Moore
complied and was exposed to various Top Secret documents about highly
sensitive government projects, including <a href="#Projects">PROJECTS
SIGMA, REDLIGHT, AQUARIUS, GALILEO, POUNCE and SNOWBIRD.</a> In
return, Moore gave Bennewitz doctored documents given to him by Doty.
Moore learnt that the US government had indeed worked with aliens in
advancing US space technology, and that three EBEs had been kept in
various Air Force Bases. In October 1988, Moore went public on the TV
show "UFO Cover-Up...Live" with <a href="#Falcon">"FALCON"</a> and <a
href="#Condor">"CONDOR"</a> who would tell the same stories that they
had told Moore. That show was considered to be the most farcical
embarrassment ever broadcast due to the fact that the informant's
revelations included declarations that the aliens liked Tibetian style
music and strawberry ice cream. Moore was devastated, and in the 1989
<a href="#MUFON">MUFON</a> annual conference, he confessed that he had
passed on disinformation from Doty to Bennewitz in order to
investigate deeper into the UFO riddle and revealed that he had spied
on various personalties in ufology.<p>

<b><a name="Oeschler">OESCHLER, ROBERT</a></b> Bob Oeschler joined the
US Air Force in 1968 in the American Forces Radio and Television
service filming classified prototype weapons systems during the
Vietnam War. When he returned to the US, he spent eighteen months at
Wright-Patterson AFB before working for NASA, specializing in missions
technical analysis as a prototype designer of control and mobile
surveillance systems. He gets his information from his alleged
contacts in the US Intelligence Community.  A controversial character,
his work in ufology seems to be OK, even though he has made the odd
wild claim. He has claimed to have worked on a government project
called "Cosmic Journey" which was an exhibition of the various US
space missions and included a section on aliens. He claims that there
was going to be a UFO in the exhibition along with a cryogenically
preserved alien body. This project was then shelved indefinitely due
to the 1988 US presidential election.  Then, in October 1993, he gave
a radio interview on BBC Radio One and claimed that he had observed a
UFO from 200 feet in the Nevada desert and basically hijacked ROBERT
LAZAR's story, claiming that everything Lazar heard and saw, he heard
and saw too. In other words, whilst his UFO investigations work is
very good (he did a very thorough and professional analysis of the <a

a set of newsgroups on Usenet. It was the first organisation that

<b><a name="Projects">PROJECT...</a></b><p>
<ul>

  <li>AQUARIUS A Top Secret project that was started in 1953 and was
set up to accumulate as much data as possible about alien life forms
and to distribute the collected information to the relevant projects.
Its existence was revealed by <a href="#Moore">WILLIAM MOORE</a> when
he released three pages of a "Project Aquarius Executive Briefing
Document" to the public. Unfortunately for Moore, this document is now
thought to be a fake due to its sloppy presentation (there was a logo
on the cover which looked like it had been drawn on with a felt-tip
pen) as well as missing background detail. Moore was asked to release
more proof that Project Aquarius existed, but he refused, saying that
the burden of proof is on those saying that the document is a hoax.

  <li>BLUE BOOK The last publicly acknowledged USAF investigation into
UFOs, and something of a controversial one, which started in March
1952. Its aims were to find explanations for UFO sightings, to assess
whether they were a threat to national security, and to determine if
the UFOs used advanced technology from which the US could learn.
Reports were collected, analyzed and filed according to their results.
No-one noticed anything was wrong with the project until one of the
people on the investigation team sent in his own sighting. It was
filed, but when he wanted to refer back to his report, it had
disappeared. He then alleged that any reports that were both
unexplained and could cause public uproar were siphoned off out of
Blue Book to somewhere else higher up in authority, a claim that
ufologists now see as fact. Blue Book was wound up in 1969 as a result
of the <a href="#Condon-Report">CONDON REPORT</a> and one of its
investigators, Dr J. Allen Hynek, went on to form the first scientific
based UFO group, the Center for UFO Studies, in 1973.

  <li>GALILEO An S-4 project dealing with flying recovered discs.

  <li>GRUDGE The successor to PROJECT SIGN which was launched to
effectively denounce the UFO problem. Journalists were encouraged to
write articles saying that UFOs didn't exist. The final report said
that, despite getting 23% more reports than Project Sign did, all
sightings could be dismissed on psychological ground and that any
further investigation should be downgraded greatly, which it was.
Project Grudge was shut down in 1950.

  <li>POUNCE A Top Secret project in 1953 that evaluated all UFOs in order
to gain more space technology knowledge.

  <li>SIGMA An ongoing 1954 Top Secret project that looked into how to
communicate with aliens. That projects existence was revealed in the
PROJECT AQUARIUS Briefing Document and is said to have succeeded in
1964 when a USAF intelligence officer met two other aliens at a
prearranged location in a desert in New Mexico. However, there is a
"Project Sigma" listed in the 1986 Defence Marketing Services Code
Name Directory as a "Top Secret Air Force program involving Rockwell
International" and has been officially identified as a laser weapons
project.

  <li>SIGN The first official USAF UFO investigation which started in
January 1948.  Its brief was to determine what UFOs were. It lasted
until February 1949, its final report saying that 20% of the cases
were unexplainable.

  <li>SNOWBIRD An ongoing 1972 Top Secret project that researched,
developed and implemented alien spacecraft technology and test flown
recovered UFOs. It is possible that the UFO involved in the <a
href="#Cash-Landrum">CASH/LANDRUM CASE</a> was built by the Americans
as part of this project, however another "Project Snowbird" has been
found described as a "Joint Army/Air Force peacetime military exercise
in the sub-arctic region in 1955" in the 1963 Gale Research's Code
Names Dictionary.  Project Snowbird is another project that was only
revealed in the PROJECT AQUARIUS Briefing Document.

  <li>TWINKLE A highly secret study into green fireballs seen in New
Mexico. By the time an investigator arrived at a scene where fireballs
had been observed, they would have disappeared so they couldn't be
investigated properly, and Project Twinkle was shut down. It was
thought that since the fireballs moved to another location before
investigators came onto the scene, the fireballs were controlled by
some intelligence.

<b><a name="Roswell">ROSWELL CASE</a></b> In July 1947 a flying saucer
crashed near Corona, New Mexico during a violent night-time
thunderstorm. The next morning, Mac Brazel found some wreckage on his
ranch spread over about half a mile which neither he nor his family
could identify. Three days later he took some wreckage to show to the
local sheriff, George Wilcox, who in turn contacted Roswell Air Army
Field and told Major Jesse Marcel of the situation. He inspected the
wreckage that Mac Brazel had brought with him to the sheriffs office
and then reported to his commanding officer, William Blanchard. He
ordered Marcel to get someone (Sheridan Cavitt) from counter
intelligence to collect as much wreckage from Brazels ranch as they
could onto their two vehicles, the wreckage was then collected and
flown to Washington, via Fort Worth. The next day, Marcel and Cavitt
returned to Brazels ranch to collect more wreckage to take back to
Roswell AAF. Cavitt went straight there whereas Marcel stopped on the
way to show his family some of the wreckage, in particular, a small
piece of tin-foil like material which would bend and be folded quite
happily, but would continually fold back out into shape leaving no
crease whatsoever. There was also a piece of very light plastic like
material, except it wasn't plastic. It was like a wooden dowel and was
a couple of inches long. It would bend slightly, but you couldn't
scratch, cut, burn or melt it. Meanwhile, Lydia Sleppy at Roswell
Radio station KSWS was transmitting a story about the crashed saucer
over the teletype when transmission was interrupted by someone
claiming to represent the FBI. The Army initially released a story to
the press saying that they had captured a flying saucer, but then
quickly put out another story saying they hadn't got a saucer, just a
weather balloon. It was _not_ a weather balloon. Mac Brazel was placed
under house arrest for a week whilst his ranch was combed for more
debris, and it was then when the main saucer body was found, complete
with four aliens, two dead, one seriously injured and another
attending to it which seemed to be unharmed. Mac Brazel was then told
that he shouldn't tell anybody about what he had found. He was
rumoured to have been bribed with a freezer (very expensive at that
time).<p>

<b><a name="SETI">SETI</a></b> The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. This is a US

transmitter are able to be picked up from space (in theory). If they
detect any abnormal emissions, they will investigate them further to
try and find out where they originate from. UFO researchers are very
skeptical of this project, saying it is just a front put up to try and
publicly "prove" that UFOs don't exist since they don't expect to find
any emissions that cannot be identified. According to an article by
Dr. Pierre Guerin in <a href="#FSR">"FLYING SAUCER REVIEW"</a>, the government already
_knows_ that aliens exist and that they are cooperating with them and
that they know that the aliens _don't_ use electromagnetic waves at
all. It would be similar to trying to detect Indian smoke signals
using a radio receiver. The SETI project was given the order to close
down by US Congress in October 1993 due to budget cuts. It wasn't a
success.<p>

SYSTEM</a>.<p>

<b><a name="Vallee-Classification">VALLEE CLASSIFICATION
SYSTEM</a></b> 
A system used to categorize the various types of
UFO and paranormal experiences invented by Dr Jacques Vallee and is now used
more often instead of the <a href="#Hynek-Classification">HYNEK
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM</a> since it gives the reader
a more detailed summary of a case. The categories are as follows...
<ul>
<li>	AN RATING   Classifies any anomalous behaviour.
<ul>
<li>	    AN1   Anomalies which have no lasting physical effects. i.e. 
amorphous lights, unexplained explosions.
<li>	    AN2   Anomalies which _do_ have lasting physical effects. i.e. 
poltergeists, materialized objects, areas of flattened grass, corn circles.
<li>	    AN3   Anomalies with associated entities. i.e. ghosts, yetis, 
spirits, elves and other mythical/legendary entities.
<li>	    AN4   Witness interaction with the AN3 entities. i.e. near-death 
experiences, religious miracles and visions, OBEs (out-of-body experiences).
<li>	    AN5   Anomalous reports of injuries and deaths. i.e. SHC 
(spontaneous human combustion), unexplained wounds as well as permanent healing 
that results from a paranormal experience.
</ul>
<li>	MA RATING   Describes behaviour of a UFO. It is analogous to the 
Nocturnal Light, Daylight Disk and Radar Visual Hynek classifications.
<ul>
<li>	    MA1   A UFO has been observed which travels in a discontinuous 
trajectory. i.e. vertical drops, manoeuvres or loops.
<li>	    MA2   MA1 plus any physical effects caused by the UFO.
<li>	    MA3   MA1 plus any entities observed on board. i.e. the airship 
cases of the late nineteenth century.
<li>	    MA4   Manoeuvres accompanied by a sense of reality transformation 
for the observer.
<li>	    MA5   A manoeuvre that results in a permanent injury or death of 
the witness.
</ul>
<li>	FB RATING   Fly-by rating.
<ul>
<li>	    FB1   A simple sighting of a UFO travelling in a straight line 
across the sky.
<li>	    FB2   FB1 accompanied by physical evidence.
<li>	    FB3   A fly-by where entities are observed on board (rare).
<li>	    FB4   A fly-by where the witness experienced a transformation of 
reality into the object or its occupants.
<li>	    FB5   A fly-by which the witness would suffer permanent injuries or
even death. i.e. CASH/LANDRUM CASE.
</ul>
<li>	CE RATING   Close Encounter rating. Similar to the Hynek Close
Encounter ratings.
<ul>
<li>	    CE1   UFO comes within 500 feet of the witness, but no after effects
are suffered by the witness or the surrounding area.
<li>	    CE2   A CE1 that leaves landing traces or injuries to the witness.
<li>	    CE3   Entities have been observed on the UFO.
<li>	    CE4   The witness has been abducted.
<li>	    CE5   CE4 which results in permanent psychological injuries or 
death.
</ul>
<li>	SVP RATING   The all-important credibility rating. "Marks" out of four 
are given for the three categories of source reliability (first digit), site 
visit (second digit) and possible explanations (third digit). A rating of 222 or
higher indicates the case was reported by a reliable source, the site has been 
visited and a natural explanation would require a major alteration of at least 
one parameter.
<ul>
<li>	    SOURCE RELIABILITY RATING
<ul>
<li>		0   Unknown or unreliable source.
<li>		1   Report attributed to a known source of unknown or 
uncalibrated reliability.

<b><a name="Vimanas">VIMANAS</a></b> Flying devices are commonplace in
many religions, and Hinduism is no exception. According to ancient
Sanskrit texts found a few years ago by Westerners in a South Indian
temple, Vimanas were open topped flying devices, not strictly UFOs
since they were restricted to the Earth's atmosphere. Dr Roberto
Pinotti is an Italian scientist, and on the 12th of October 1988 was a
speaker in the World Space Conference in Bangalore, India. He referred
to several Hindu texts and pointed out that Indian gods and heroes
fought in the skies using piloted vehicles armed with weapons. These
weapons consisted of seven different types of mirrors and lenses which
were used for offensive and defensive purposes. The "Pinjula Mirror"
offered a form of "visual shield" preventing the pilots from "evil
rays", and the weapon named "Marika" was used to shoot enemy aircraft.
Dr Pinotti said that these weapons "do not seem to be too different
from what we today call laser technology." The vehicles themselves
were made of special heat absorbing metals, called "Somaka, Soundalike
and Mourthwika".  According to Dr Pinotti, the "principles of
propulsion as far as the descriptions were concerned, might be defined
as electrical and chemical, but solar energy was involved as well."
Other scientists have put forward the theory that the craft were
driven by some sort of mercury ion propulsion system.  Dr Pinotti
concluded that the fact that Vimanas were written about hundreds,
perhaps even thousands, of years ago, plus that they resembled modern
UFOs would suggest that India had a "...superior but forgotten
civilisation. In the light of this, we think it will be better to
examine the Hindu texts and subject the descriptive models of Vimanas
to more scientific scrutiny." "So where does the ET connection come
in?" you're asking me. Well, since the texts were written hundreds or
even thousands of years ago, we can safely assume that no human
civilization could produce _any_ flying machines, but these Vimanas
_did_ exist, along with a mercury ion propulsion system and a form of
laser technology, so where could they get the ideas for these devices
from? Enter some ET influences and you're away. But that leads us to
the question of "where did all this new technology go?" We don't know,
but since the texts exist and the properties of the Vimanas have been
proved to be possible by scientists, we know that they did exist.<p>

<b><a name="Walton">TRAVIS WALTON ABDUCTION CASE</a></b> In November
1975, a group of six tree-trimmers were driving home from work in a
truck in the Sitgreave-Apache National Forest in Arizona, USA. The
driver stopped the truck when he noticed that a flying saucer was
hovering about fifteen feet above some nearby trees. Travis Walton
approached the craft on foot, despite the objections of his workmates.
He was then knocked to the ground by a blue and white light. When the
men in the truck saw this, they were terrified and sped off down the
road leaving him for dead.  Once they had calmed down, they returned
to that spot and couldn't find any sign of Travis or the flying
saucer. Five days later, Travis was returned to earth wondering what
had happened to him for the past few days. He found out by undergoing
<a href="#Hypnotic">HYPNOTIC REGRESSION</a>, the same technique that
was used in the <a href="#Hill-Abduct">HILL ABDUCTION CASE.</a> This
is what the regression revealed: When he came to after being knocked
out by the blue and white light, he was lying on his back on a table
in what he thought was a hospital. It was _not_ a hospital, a fact
that was brought home to him when he focused on three figures standing
around him.  These were aliens, Travis described them as looking like
5-foot foetuses with mushroom-white skin and they wore tight-fitting,
tan-brown robes. On seeing this, Travis got _very_ scared and tried to
attack them, but they just backed off into another room, leaving
Travis alone, so he started to walk around. He walked into a separate
room and saw a large backed chair in the centre of it with a few
buttons on one arm of the chair and a lever on the other.  He played
about with those and the ship responded to some of his actions. A more
human-looking alien wearing a helmet then walked in and took him for a
guided tour of the ship, ignoring any questions that Travis asked him.
They then walked into a hangar containing three other saucers and was
met by three other human-like aliens, two men and a woman. Travis was
then put onto a table and a mask was put over his face. The next thing
he remembered he was waking up on a pavement in a village a few miles
away from his home watching the saucer move off silently.<p>

<b><a name="Zeta-Ret">ZETA RETICULI</a></b> A binary star system that
is roughly 37 light years away from Earth. The aliens that abducted
Betty and Barney Hill (see <a href="#Hill-Abduct">HILL ABDUCTION
CASE)</a> were calculated to come from a planet in this system, and <a
href="#Lazar">ROBERT LAZAR</a> claimed that the nine UFOs he saw in
S-4 came from one of the planets in the Zeta Reticuli star system.<p>

"UFO: The Gulf Breeze Sightings" by Ed & Frances Walters.<p>

I highly recommend that you read the starred books, especially "Above
Top Secret" and "UFOs : The Gulf Breeze Sightings", "ATS" because of
it's thorough investigation into the worldwide UFO cover-up and it's
use of documents released under the US Freedom of Information act, and
"UFOS : TGBS" because it is a very believable first-hand account of Ed
and Frances Walters' close encounters of 1987/8 and it also includes
all 40 photos that they had taken during that period.<p>

For more information:<p>

FTP to the following sites and you'll be able to download more

rubbish on these sites as well as some reliable stuff, you'll just
have to sort the chaff from the wheat.<p>

<h2>What to do if you see a UFO.</h2>

1. Scream. Honestly! This will attract the people around you who will wonder
what you're screaming about. You then point out the UFO to them and you
instantly gain a few back-up witnesses to the sighting. Sightings which have
only one witness carries very little weight, but one reported by two independent
witnesses adds a lot of credibility to a UFO sighting.<p>

2. If you have a camera, try and take a few pictures. The best photos of UFOs
have background and foreground details in the shot, try not to just photograph
it in the sky. This enables the investigator to give a better estimate of the
size of the UFO.<p>

3. Write down what you saw as soon as possible. Draw a sketch of it and show
where any lights were positioned on the craft. Also describe the path it flew.<p>

4. If the UFO landed on the ground or even just scraped it for a seconds, try
and stop anybody from getting near the area. If you have a camera, photograph
the area.<p>

5. REPORT the sighting AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. This allows the UFO investigator to
interview the witnesses whilst the memory of the event is still fresh. <p>

If the sighting was in the UK, write to the BUFORA Director Of investigations at :<p>
