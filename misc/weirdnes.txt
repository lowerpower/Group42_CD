high weirdness by email v2.1  send info and errata to: mporter@nyx.cs.du.edu
----------------------------
This version *supersedes* previous "editions"; they may safely be deleted
without loss of important information.
As always, this is coming out in a rush, so there are probably lots of holes,
etc. Also, this is a rather long document, and unless you have some sort of
keyword search you may have trouble finding what you're after. I am hoping to
get a hypertext version of this woven into the WorldWideWeb some day [telnet
info.cern.ch and look around] but dont hold your breath. In the mean time
just delete what you dont want. IF YOU ARE GOING TO ARCHIVE THIS OR REPRODUCE
IT, FEEL FREE TO EDIT IT FOR COMPREHENSIBILITY, RELEVANCE, ETC.

At the last minute, trying to put something together for release, I have
simply joined together some "unprocessed" files - they describe:
i] some things from the slopoke ftp site
ii] contents of the red.css political archive [ftp]
iii] scott yanoff's internet resource list
iv] an IRC FAQ
v] some stuff 'left over' from the future-culture FAQ
vi] cult of the dead cow newfiles
vii] ftp.rahul.net archive contents
viii] email addresses for sf fan groups
In the interests of getting info out, etc, this hodgepodge is going out in a
separate file - if anyone wants to archive it as well, & you're on a dos
system, I suggest weird2-1.doc and weird2-1.sup as file names.

if you see something in the unseen category & want to write a review, send it
to me, say whether you want your name used, etc.

A  general note: the "best" general net guides are in my opinion
the FutureCulture FAQ (see cyberpunk section) & the Scott Yanoff guide
(appended to this document).
For hardcopy, try the books by Krol and LaQuey, and watch out for Howard
Rheingold's new book on the Internet...

And speaking of books... Have a look at the novella "Voices", by the
mysterious "Scotto", available via ftp from penguin.gatech.edu,

         comments by Anon of Ibid:
            * This site has lots of Crowley texts and gifs, including the
            *complete* texts of the Book of Lies, Book of the Law, Book 4,
            Magick in Theory and Practice, Magick Without Tears, and some
            (or all) copies of the Equinox. (Crowley's magickal journal/
            zine/publication type thing) All this stuff is in directory
             /pub/magick/incoming. But there's lots more than Crowley stuff.
            Check this site out.
[Back to me:]
Also worth perusing are wilson.on.cis, an online conference with RAWilson as
guest participant, and cybercraft, which contains an exposition of Leary's
8-circuit model. ALSO, copies of the Equinox are retailing where I live
for about $700 (for 10 vols.) at present. You could probably make yourself
same money, and do yourself a favor, and violate some sort of copyright law
by printing copies of the Equinox based on the slopoke material.
  In fact the whole slopoke site is just one of the best. They have an old
alt.slack archive (old*slack!), extensive Notes on Kabbala that you won't
find anywhere else, the Principia Discordia.

One final note for now, but only for those who've persisted all the way
through this. If you're interested in these sorts of ideas, but with a
Discordian/SubGenius sort of slant, you might want to try ploughing through
the "Travelling Scriptures of the Church of Virtuality\Reality", or the
Scriptures of V\R for short. Principia Discordia mixed with equal parts of LSD
and MUD. You can get them (there's about 1 Meg of text so far) via anonymous

there's an automatic decompression thingy for any file ending .Z, so you
can ftp-by-mail even *those* ones! /pub/subgenius contains a bob.gif, plus
lots of other SubG stuff; and of course they have the Principia Discordia.
/pub/journals has *heaps* of stuff, FutureCulture, m00se Illuminati (for
info on *them* mail dickson@hartford.bitnet), Purps (the Purple
Thunderbolt of Spode, the Otisian newsletter (see above)), other stuff I

In Robert Anton Wilson's _Illuminatus! Trilogy_, he describes
a process used by Discordians, Erisians and Anarchists against
governments, corporations and in general, The Establishment.
This process involves sending many letters from different
parts of the country/world and is called Operation Mindfuck.
With the advent of e-mail, Operation Mindfucks are much more
easily coordinated.  One such network can be joined by e-mailing

objectivism
    Contact:  objectivism-request@vix.com  (Paul Vixie)
    Purpose:  A mailing list where students of Objectivism can discuss
    their ideas, concrete issues, exchange news, etc.  Any issue that
    may have some relevance to Objectivists is appropriate here.
objectivism-request@vixie.sf.ca.us **
objectivism discussion list - seems to be fairly low traffic - to access the
archives mail objectivism-listserv@vix.com with the single-line msg 'help'

objectivism-philosophy
    Contact: objectivism-request@twwells.com (T. William Wells)
    Purpose: A mailing list for discussion of the philosophy of
    Objectivism. This is not a general Objectivism mailing list;
    discussions are restricted to the philosophy itself.

Let me add a little rant here expressing my annoyance that
talk.philosophy.objectivism was voted down. WHY did you vote 'no', those of
you who did? "Oh, I'm tired of the newsgroup hierarchies fragmenting." Pfah!
If you're not interested in Objectivism you wouldnt have had to read the
newsgroup. And if you _were_ interested in Objectivism, and voted against it..
I don't understand you _at all_.

pkd-list
    Contact: pkd-list-request@wang.com
    Purpose: The discussion of the works and life of Philip K. Dick
    (1928-1982), one of the world's most unusual science fiction writers.
    Topics include his books and stories, and books and stories about him
    and his life; however, discussion can (of necessity) branch out into
    the nature of reality, consciousness and religious experience.
not responding to my inquiries, unfortunately
they have now! took em 3 months, but I'm on. this one goes in spurts. I'm more
interested in the later Valis stuff, but theres also discussion of Dick's
earlier works, for those who find the gnostic overtones of the later ones
distasteful.

PMC-TALK - discussion forum for PMC list (=postmodern culture?)
PMC@ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu is the editors' address
an incredible range of files: poetry, postmodern ecology, "stemmatics",
James Joyce, mail art, Gulf War, concepts of time, everyday aesthetics,
logs of 2 years' worth of discussions - just looking at the titles I
can't guess what some of them are about. Send for PMC-TALK GUIDE for
proper info.
"... if you need PMC-TALK GUIDE and don't know how to get it,
send the following one-line mail message to LISTSERV@NCSUVM (on

alife
    Contact: alife-request@cognet.ucla.edu
    Purpose: The alife mailing list is for communications regarding
    artificial life, a formative interdisciplinary field involving
    computer science, the natural sciences, mathematics, medicine and
    others.  The recent book _Artificial Life_, Christopher Langton, ed.,
    Addison Wesley, 1989 introduces the scope of artificial life as a field
    of study.  Alife was chartered in February 1990 at the Second Artificial
    Life Workshop, held in Santa Fe & organized by the Center for Nonlinear
    Studies at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Santa Fe
    Institute.  The list is intended primarily for low-volume, high-content
    scientific correspondence and as a publically accessible forum for the
    interested members of the public.  Membership as of July 1990 includes
    over 1,200 addresses on four continents.  There is an FTP-accessible
    archives/repository of past traffic, software and papers.  The list
    is maintained by the Artificial Life Research Group, Computer Science
    Department, Lindley Hall 101, Indiana University Bloomington, IN 47405.
    There are conditions on redistribution of the list in order to minimize
    any misunderstanding or exaggeration concerning this new area of study.

          numbers too large for current yr/mo have previous yr/mo prepended.
          get also defaults to current year, e.g. `get 9005' during 1991 gives
          `get 9109005' , and months/numbers too large for current year
          default to previous year. mixed formats e.g.
          `get 1 08005 2 55 harvmac.tex 9109058 2.abs'   also work.)
listing         returns list of year/month's currently available.
list yymm's      returns title/author's of papers currently held for
                   given yr/mo subsets,  e.g. `list 9109'.

*** EXTROPIANS ***
extropians-request@gnu.ai.mit.edu **
serious discussion of extropian/upwing ideas such as physical immortality,
anarchocapitalism, postindustrial society etc
    Purpose: The unifying characteristic of the list recipients is
    their latest interest in anarchocapitalist politics, techniques
    of life extension (including cryonics), the technological extension
    of human intelligence and perception, nanotechnology, spontaneous
    orders, memetics, and a number of other related ideas.  If these
    topics seem to you to be naturally related and mutually consistent,
    you might already be an Extropian.

                                         Derek Zahn
  Summary: A response to Hilary Putnam's view that evolution produced our
           minds by lots of kludges, making AI an inherently infeasible task.

  Summary: Preprint of 1992 IEEE Physics of Computation Workshop paper
           suggesting that AI as goal-directed behavior is non-reversible
           and thus must pay entropic penalties, especially for measuring
           the environment.  Communication, however, may be much cheaper.

*** INFORMATION SERVICES ***

email nuts@ora.com for orderinng info re "!%@:: A Directroy of Electronic Mail
Addressing and Networks" (a paper publication)

amixinfo@markets.amix.com - amix is american information exchange - they
are apparently an online information market (!?)
- after the last Hwbemail was posted to Usenet the full Amixinfo blurb was
posted, here are some excerpts:
AMIX, the American Information Exchange, is something completely new --
an online Information Marketplace (R).  On AMIX, anyone can both buy and
_sell_ documents, software, or anything that can be stored digitally.
Those who buy or sell customized information can carry out consulting
contracts, even very small ones, easily and profitably.  AMIX handles all
the funds transfer automatically.
This Information Marketplace has been open for business continuously since
January 1, 1992.  Consulting contracts are being made and fulfilled; 
document sales are occurring on a daily basis in key markets; and information
providers continue to "stock the shelves" with new goods in all markets.  
The AMIX software allows customers to explore the system online with guest 
access, and to register their own account online to receive full access.
Customers who open their accounts now will have their monthly fees waived
for the month in which they sign up and for the following month.
To receive the AMIX software disk, enabling guest exploration of the system
and self-registration, contact AMIX by email at amixinfo@markets.amix.com
or by phone (415) 903-1015.
What follows is an overview of AMIX: its concepts, structure, and function; 
the market-building phase; and advantages of early entry into the market.
[but i wont include this..]

pit-manager.mit.edu /pub/usenet hundreds of directories with all sorts
  of things archived it seems, eg /news.answers has heaps of faqs,
  /alt.drugs a few alt.drugs regular postings

NEWSPOSTING by mail - Once upon a time apparently, you could post
to news by mailing ucbvax.berkeley.edu in the format
  favourite-newsgroup@ucbvax.etc
and the text of your message would be posted to favourite.newsgroup. That
service isn't working any more, *but* someone told me that the same thing
can now be done through cs.utexas.edu (I think).
Scott yanoff says this is working but I say it isn't. but try one of the
anonymous servers, eg email help@anon.penet.fi
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT OTHER ANONYMOUS SERVICES LIKE THIS ONE! the one in
Finland is getting overworked, I am sure. Or in general any other news/mail
gateways.

Subject: learning email/Internet

A lot of people have talked about email hacks here, and some have mentioned
not being terribly familiar yet with Internet.  Here's a couple good
pointers:
0
starters:
_The Internet Companion_ by Tracy LaQuey, with Jeanne Ryer, forward by Al
Gore.
"A Beginner's Guide To Global Networking".  Hey, it's only eleven bucks,
it's extremely readable, and even the direst Net guru can learn a few tricks
here.  Tracy knows the Net, in vivid detail, and explains its workings at
the level of somebody who knows enough to power up their Mac or PC.  ISBN
0-201-62224-6, Addison-Wesley, 1993.  I'll post a better review to the Net
later..  Send email to: "internet-companion@utexas.edu" for info, ordering,
etc.

not-so-novice:
There's an email list called Cypherpunks outta Berkeley.  If U know what
you're doing here, you might wanna get on it..  Lots of encryption
discussion, but also the place where these anonymous remailers have been
breeding.  Guaranteed that you'll learn more than you ever thought possible
about email hacks, if you can grok that list's discussions.  Send email to:
cypherpunks-request@toad.com

    Purpose: This list is under the aegis of l'Alliance Monarchists
    and is dedicated to promoting the cause of traditional monarchy
    and the Counter Revolution.  We believe in government based on
    natural law principles, decentralization, subsidiarity, an economy 
    based on the principles of distributive justice, and the defense of 
    traditional Western values.
    We believe in a Europe, United, Traditional, and Free from the
    Atlantic to the Urals, but we oppose the centralizing bureaucracy
    of the Maastricht treaty.  While we are based in the US, we are 
    affiliated with L'Alliance pour la maintenance de la France en Europe, 
    and we have members, as well as fraternal relations with the monarchist
    organizations, in most Western European countries.
    We work for the strengthening of existing monarchies, the restoration
    in those countries with a monarchist tradition, and the building up
    of an infrastructure appropriate to the instuaration of monarchy in
    those countries without a living monarchist tradition.

home of luigi - bob drake - editor/assembler of taproot, "a quarterly
publication of independent, underground, and experimental language-centred
arts..." who have put out over 40 collections of such - now taproot is
experimentally going online with a collection of zine reviews. i have seen
issue #0, part 1, which contains those reviews; i am not a zine person
myself (i have my hands full with what i'm getting over the net!!) but
some of the stuff reviewed looked really interesting. there's also reviews
of poetry chapbooks (?) (unseen) and future issues will include mailart
sections. [speaking of which, is there such a thing as internet mailart
yet?] send a request and luigi-bob will mail you with whatever he has.
worth getting. and say you liked it if you did (same applies to all these
people); feedback is essential at this stage of development.

cyberculture
cyberpunk (literary and cultural movements)
cyberspace
new edge
nootropics or other drugs
raves
technoculture
virtual reality
music, movies, books, magazines that fit into the mold

NOTE [from me]: YOU CANT GET AGRIPPA or AGR1PPA FROM future-request ANY MORE.

        [Last Updated 12-October-1991]
   MindMachine Digest is a list devoted to discussions
   on the use, construction, and future potential
   of mind machines. Mind machines are electronic devices
   or methods that non-invasively alter human consciousness.
   Other topics of discussion can include: meditation,
   accelerated learning, hypnosis, float tanks, and other
   methods of altering consciousness. A strong emphasis is placed
   on the scientific study of these methods as well as the
   construction of mind machines devices.

What this is doing in the subgenius directory I don't know - transcript of the
chapter from "Are You a Transhuman?" by FM2030 [formerly FM Esfandiary] in
which he outlines the ideology he tentatively designates "Up-Wing" -
pro-physical immortality, pro-space colonization, "telespheres",
teledemocracy, "networks of intimacy" etc etc. also available via anon ftp
from slopoke, /pub/incoming/upwinger. These ideas have a lot in common with
Extropian ideas (see elsewhere) except that FM's slant is more collectivist in
its orientation I think.

Psyche e-zine - contact X91007@phillip.edu.au - speculative science / culture
-------------------------------------------------------
Announcement: New Electronic Magazine 'Psyche'.
[first issue out march '93?]0
Examples of some of the general areas that Psyche will cover
are: the mind-body problem; altered-states-of-consciousness;
psychoactive drugs; shamanism; dream states; hypnosis;
artificial intelligence; meditative states; ecstatic
religious states; blindsight; language and mind.
In an attempt to offer a grounding in some of the central
themes of Psyche, major review articles of influential
ideas/books/movements will also be solicited. Examples of
what these might be are: John Searle's Chinese Room Problem;
Daniel Dennett's book 'Consciousness Explained'; Gordon
Wasson's theories regarding Soma; Roger Penrose's book 'The
Emperor's New Mind'.
While Psyche will not be peer-reviewed this does not mean
that it will become a haven for New Age/Lunatic Fringe ideas.
I have just completed a BSc Honours majoring in psychology,
and I am currently studying the way the brain codes the
position of objects. I would like to balance by skills with
others and so am particularly interested in getting in
contact with people with backgrounds in either computer
science, philosophy or anthropology to act as sub/co-editors.

        SUPPLEMENT TO high weirdness by email v2.1

*** what this file is ***

At the last minute, trying to put something together for release, I have
simply joined together some "unprocessed" files - they describe:
i] some things from the slopoke ftp site
ii] contents of the red.css political archive [ftp]
iii] scott yanoff's internet resource list
iv] an IRC FAQ
v] some stuff 'left over' from the future-culture FAQ
vi] cult of the dead cow newfiles
vii] ftp.rahul.net archive contents
viii] email addresses for sf fan groups
In the interests of getting info out, etc, this hodgepodge is going out in a
separate file - if anyone wants to archive it as well, & you're on a dos
system, I suggest weird2-1.doc and weird2-1.sup as file names.

*** THE IRC FAQ ***
(1) What is IRC?
        IRC stands for "Internet Relay Chat". It was written by Jarkko
Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi) in 1988. Since starting in Finland, it
has been used in some 20+ countries spanning the globe.  It was designed
as a replacement for the "talk" program but has become much much more
than that. IRC is a multi-user chat system, where people convene on
"channels" (a virtual place, usually with a topic of conversation) to
talk in groups, or privately.
        IRC gained international fame during the late Persian Gulf War,
where updates from around the world came accross the wire, and most
people on irc gathered on a single channel to hear these reports.

(2) How is IRC set up?
        The user runs a "client" program (usually called 'irc') which
connects to the irc network via another program called a "server".
Servers exist to pass messages from user to user over the irc network.

(3) How do I use a client?
        You either compile the source yourself, have someone else on
your machine compile the source for you, or use the TELNET client.
"telnet bradenville.andrew.cmu.edu". Please only use the latter when you
have no other way of reaching irc, as this resource is quite limited.

(4) Where can I get source for the irc client?
UNIX client-> cs.bu.edu /irc/clients
              plod.cbme.unsw.edu.au
              nic.funet.fi pub/unix/irc
              ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de pub/net/irc
              slopoke.mlb.semi.harris.com
              there is also a client avaliable with the server code.
EMACS elisp-> cs.bu.edu /irc/clients/elisp
              nic.funet.fi
              ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de
              slopoke.mlb.semi.harris.com
EMACS elisp "irchat"->  cs.bu.edu /irc/clients/elisp
                        lehtori.cc.tut.fi:/pub/irchat
                        nic.funet.fi:/pub/irchat
VMS ->        cs.bu.edu /irc/clients/vms
              coombs.anu.edu.au
REXX client for VM->    cs.bu.edu /irc/clients/rxirc
                        ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de pub/irc/rxirc
MSDOS->         cs.bu.edu /irc/clients/msdos
                freebie.engin.umich.edu:/pub/irc/clients/MSDOS

Macintosh->     cs.bu.edu /irc/clients/macintosh
                sumex-aim.stanford.edu /info-mac/comm

(5) Which server do I connect to?
        It's usually best to try and connect to one geographically
close, even though that may not be the best. You can always ask when you
get on irc. Here's a list of servers avaliable for connection:
                csd.bu.edu
                ucsu.colorado.edu
                badger.ugcs.caltech.edu
                ug.cs.dal.ca
                nic.funet.fi
                vesuv.unisg.ch
                munagin.ee.mu.oz.au
                sunsystem2.informatik.tu-muenchen.de

This is, by no means, a comprehensive list, but merely a start. Connect
to the closest of these servers and join the channel #Twilight_Zone
When you get there, immediately ask what you want. Don't say "I have a
question" because then hardly anyone will talk.

(6) OK, I've got a client and I'm connected to a server? Now what?
        It's probably best to take a look around and see what you want
to do first. All irc commands start with a "/", and most are one word.
Typing /help will get you help information. /names will get you a list
of names, etc.

The output is typically something like this-> (Note there are more
channels than this, this is just sample output).

Pub: #hack      zorgo eiji Patrick fup htoaster
Pub: #Nippon    @jircc @miyu_d
Pub: #nicole    MountainD
Pub: #hottub    omar liron beer Deadog moh pfloyd Dode greywolf SAMANTHA

"Pub" means public (or "visible") channel. "hack" is the channel name.
"#" is the prefix (see number 7 below). A "@" before someone's nickname
indicates he/she is the "Channel operator" of that channel. A Channel
Operator is someone who has control over a specific channel. It can be
shared or not as the first Channel Operator sees fit. The first person
to join the channel automatically gets Channel Operator, and can share
it with anyone he/she chooses (or not).
0
(7) I hear this talk about "+" channels, but I don't see any. What were
they?
        "+" channels were in older server versions. They no longer
exist, and probably will stay dead in later code revisions.

(8) What are good channels to try while using irc?
        #hottub and #initgame are almost always teeming with people.
#hottub is meant to simulate a hot tub, and #initgame is non-stop game
of "inits" (initials). Just join and find out!
        Many irc operators are in #Twilight_Zone ... so if you join
that channel and don't hear much talking, don't worry, it's not because
you joined, operators don't talk much on that channel anyways!
0
(9) How can I find out more about how + and # channels are changing?
        ftp to cs.bu.edu and look at irc/irc-2.7.CHANGES

(10) What if someone tells me to type something cryptic?
        Never type anything anyone tells you to without knowing what it
is. There is a problem with typing a certain command with the ircII
client that gives anyone immediate control of your client (and thus can
alter your account environment also).
0
(11) What is NickServ? What if I can't remember my NickServ password?
        To quote from NickServ's help text, NickServ's purpose is to
keep unique nicknames on irc. NickServ sends a warning to anyone else
who signs on with your nickname.  If you don't use IRC for 10 weeks,
your nickname expires for reuse.
0
        Only a NickServ operator can change your nickserv password.
To find out which NickServ operators are online, send
/msg NickServ@service.de OPERWHO

Nicknames with a "*" next to them are online at the time.

(12) What is IPCLUB? GIF-Archives of IRC-persons?
        IPCLUB stands for IRC Picture Club. It is an E-Mail service
provided by tommi@phoenix.oulu.fi for all the users of the Internet. For
more help, mail tommi@phoenix.oulu.fi with the subject of "IPCLUB/HELP".
0
(13) Where can I learn more?
        A good place to start might be downloading the irc tutorials.
They're avaliable via anonymous ftp from cs.bu.edu in
/irc/support/tutorial.* .. You can also join various IRC related mailing
lists. "operlist" is a list that discusses current (and past) server
code, routing, and protocol. You can join by mailing
operlist-request@eff.org. You can join the irchat mailing list by
mailing irchat-request@cc.tut.fi. There is a low traffic ircII mailing
list, mail dl2p+@andrew.cmu.edu to be added. Another mailing list,
ircd-three@eff.org, exists to discuss protocol revisions for the 3.0
release of the ircd, currently in planning. Mail
ircd-three-request@eff.org to be added to that.
0
(13) What do I do if I'm still confused or have additions to this posting?
        email hrose@eff.org or ask for help (in #Twilight_Zone) on irc.



*** LEFTOVERS FROM THE FUTURE CULTURE CYBEROGRAPHY ***
this is all stuff from the FC FAQ which ought to be included just because it's
on the net, but which for one reason or other I haven't put in the other
sections yet.

 _________________________________/Text Files\_________________________________

201: "One Wrong Move" by The Deth Vegetable.  We start '93 off right with this
strong cDc debut from Deth Veggie.  An artist with a shotgun?  You KNOW it's
gonna be rad.
0
202: "Monster Jennifer, or Celibacy Can Kill You" by Omega.  Another '93 cDc
debut by Omega, sysop of Moody Loners With Handguns BBS and author of a tech
article published in the November, '92 issue of MONDO 2000.  Let's sing!
"Jennifer, hey, it's Jennifer... she's got a penis, hey wow, she's really
beautiful and kinda crazy... HEY!  IT'S JENNIFER!"
0
203: "The Briefing" by Reid Fleming.  Yet ANOTHER cDc debut, this one a
gripping tale of political intrigue and space aliens.  "Mr. President, you're
NOT on Candid Camera."

204: "Life in General" by Video Vindicator.  Mr. Fraud himself takes keyboard
in hand to deliver a heaping batch of opinions for you to ponder.  He disses
lame females!  He disses lame cars!  This file's got it all!
0
205: "That Which Strikes Terror Into the Hearts of Men" by Lady Carolin.  A
creepy old house, a dorky womanizer, and a mad grrrl with a chainsaw boogie
down!  Wooh!  It's the battle of the sexes!  ACTION!  ZOW!!
0
206: "The Power of Art" by THE NIGHTSTALKER.  It's the crazed man with feces on
his mind, mailing lumps of his bowel's best work to the President's lovely
daughter.  How touching!  Never let it be said that cDc lacks tender-hearted
affection!  We're all very fuzzy and warm.
0
207: "F23" by Obscure Images.  Ominous cyberpunk innuendo stuff with
mind-control and Catholic confessions.  You know it's REAL cyberpunk 'cause it
was a t-file FIRST.
0
208: "A Visit to the Slaughterhouse" by Transderm-Nitro.  Hey hey - let's go on
a pleasant little jaunt down to the slaughterhouse and kill us some cows!
Yeehaw.  It's educational - Mr. Nitro breaks it on down for YOU.  Dead cows,
it's a subject EVERYONE's interested in.
0
209: "Helmet Interview: July 17, 1992" by G.A. Ellsworth.  Transcription of
G.A. interviewing Page Hamilton, singer and bandleader of Helmet.
0

# #   The ftp site for acidwarp is ftp.rahul.net, in /pub/atman/mind-candy.
#
# I've tried to connect there several times. It always just hangs. Anyone
# else had any luck?

I got in with no problem this afternoon.  
The path is a little different than above.     
Some intersting stuff here.
Here's a deep of /pub/atman, which I trimmed down with vi.
Notice it looks like backs of futureCulture are there, too.
