<h3>Basic Alliance Teleconferencing</h3><p>
An Original Text File by Bungalow Bill<p>
President/Founder, the Center for the Study of Viral Pathology<p>Introduction:<p>------------<p>This file will deal with accessing, understanding and using the Alliance Teleconferencing Systems. It has many sections and for best use should be printed out. Enjoy!<p>Alliance:<p>--------<p>Alliance Teleconferencing is an independant company which allows the general public
to access and use it's conferencing equipment.<p>Many rumors have been floating around that Alliance is a subsidary of AT&T. Well, they are wrong. As stated above, Alliance is an entirely independant company. They use sophisticated equipment to allow users to talk to many people at once.<p>The Number:<p>---------<p>Alliance is in the 700 exchange, thus it is not localized, well, not in a way. Alliance is only in certain states, and only residents of these certain states can access by dialing direct. T
his, however, will be discussed in a later chapter. The numbers for alliance are as follows:<p>	0-700-456-1000 (chicago)<p>		        -1001 (los angeles)<p>		        -1002 (chicago)<p>		        -1003 (houston)<p>		        -2000 (san francisco)<p>		        -2001 (dallas)<p>		        -2002 (boston)<p>		        -2003 (tallahasee)<p>		        -3000 (miami)<p>		        -3001 (los angeles)<p>		        -3002 (portland)<p>		        -3003 (baltimore)<p>Dialing:<p>-------<p>As stated before, Alliance 
is only in certain states and only these states can access them via dialing direct. However, dialing direct causes your residence to be charged for the conference and conference bills are not low! Therefore, two ways have been discovered to start a conference without having it billed to ones house. They are as follows:<p>     1) Dialing through a PBX<p>     2) Billing to a loop<p>     I am sure there are many more but these are the two I will deal with.<p>Dialing through a PBX:<p>------------------
----<p>Probably the easiest method of creating a free conference is through a PBX. Simply call one in a state that has Alliance, input the PBX's code, dial 9 for an outside line and then dial alliance.<p>An example of this would be:<p>PBX: 800-241-4911<p>When it answers it will give you a tone.  At this tone input your code.<p>Code: 1234<p>After this you will receive another tone, now dial 9 for an outside line.  You will now hear a dial tone.<p>Simply dial Alliance from this point and the conf
erence will be billed to the PBX. See PBXhack.txt for more info on PBX's.<p>Billing to a loop:<p>----------------<p>A second method of receiving a free conference is by billing it to a loop. A loop is 2 numbers that when two people call, they can talk to each other. You're saying whoopee right? Wrong! Loops can be very usefull to phreaks.  First, dial Alliance direct. After going through the beginning procedure, which will be discussed later in this tutorial, dial 0 and wait for an Alliance operator. Wh
en she answers tell her you would like to bill the conference to such and such a number. (A loop where your friend is on the other side) She will then call that number to receive voice verification.<p>Of course your phriend will be waiting and will accept the charges. Thus, the conference is billed to the loop.<p>Logon Procedure:<p>------------------<p>Once Alliance answers you will hear a two-tone combination. This is their way of saying 'How many people do you want on the conference?' Simply type i
n a 2-digit combination, depending on what bridge of Alliance you are on, between 10 and 59.  After this either hit '*' to cancel the conference size and input another or hit '#' to continue.<p>You are now in Alliance Teleconferencing and are only seconds away from having your own roaring conference going strong!<p>Dialing in Conferees:<p>---------------------<p>To dial your first conferee, dial 1+npa+exc+suff and await his/her answer.<p>npa=area code<p>exc=exchange<p>suff=suffix<p>If the number
 is busy, or if no one answers simply hit '*' and your call willbe aborted. But, if they do answer, hit the '#' key. This will add them to theconference.<p>Now commence dialing other conferees.<p>Joining Your Conference:<p>----------------------<p>To join your conference from control mode simply hit the '#' key. Within asecond or two you will be chatting with all your buddies. To go back intocontrol mode, simply hit the '#' key again.<p>Transferring Control:<p>----------------------<p>To trans
fer control to another conferee, go into control mode, hit the #6+1+npa+exc+suff of the conferee you wish to give control to.<p>If after, you wish to abort this transfer hit the '*' key.<p><note>: Transfer of control is often not available. When you receive a message stating this, you simply cannot transfer control.<p>Muted Conferences:<p>-----------------<p>To request a muted conference simply hit the 9 key. A muted conference means that the operator cannot come into the conversation for any reaso
n, and I highly suggest that you utilize this option.<p>Dialing Alliance Operators:<p>------------------------<p>Simply dial 0 as you would from any fone and wait for the operator to answer.<p>Ending Your Conference:<p>---------------------<p>To end your conference all together, that is kick everyone including yourself off, go into control mode and hit '*'. After a few seconds simply hang up. Your conference is over.<p>Are Alliance Operators Dangerous:<p>------------------------------<p>No. Not 
in the least. The worst they can do to you while you are having a conference is drop all conferees including yourself. This is in no way harmful, just a pain in the ass.<p>Alliance and Tracing:<p>------------------<p>Alliance can trace, as all citizens of the United States can. But this has to all be pre-mediated and AT&T has to be called and it's really a large hastle, therefore, it is almost never done. Alliance simply does not want it known that teenagers are fucking them over. The only sort of safet
y equipment Alliance has on-line is a simple pen register. This little device simply records all the numbers of the conferees dialed. No big deal. All Alliance can do is call up that persons number, threaten and question. However, legally, they can do nothing because all you did was answer your phone.<p><note>: Almost all instructions are told to the person in command by Alliance recordings. A lot of this tutorial is just a listing of those commands plus information gathered by either myself or the fellow
 phreaks of the world.<p>
