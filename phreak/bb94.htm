Well, I've been promising DeadKat an article since COTNO #1, and was
searching frantically for a subject that I could write a useful/informative
article on...having failed dismally in my quest, I decided to turn my
attention to a beginners guide to present day blueboxing.  This article
will only deal with the practical uses of CCITT 5 (C5) signalling systems,
and NOT with the more advanced systems such as R2.  Becoming familiar with
C5 signalling will provide you with a good grounding in blueboxing,
therefore making understanding a guide on a future system easier.  And so
to the main text...


<H3>"You just blast 2600hz right?"</H3>

No.  All too often when blueboxing is mentioned in the context of actually
doing it today, some dolt pipes up with this.  Treasure your old Mark Tabas
files, for they contain some excellent information even today, especially
concerning routing codes, but forget all about the R1 signalling described
within his 'Better Homes and Blueboxing' guide.  The system we are
concerned with today is C5, so swiftly clear the limited space available in
your mind.  The first point I would like to make is that you will NOT be
siezing trunks within your own country.  The focus of your attentions will
be those 1-800 wonders known as 'Country Direct' numbers, which will
connect you to the telephone system of some far-off nation for the princely
sum of $0.00.  While these are certainly not the only countries you should
experiment with, South American and Asian countries are usually the best
bet for a C5 connection that you can seize.  From nearly all European
locations it is possible to bluebox over Chile for example, and lines to
Columbia, the Philipines, Taiwan and Thailand are also often C5 connections
to your country.  While these provide a good starting point for your
adventures with C5, don't restrict your attempts to only the aforementioned
places...You never know what you might find...


<H3>"So, uhh, what next?"</H3>

After dialling a country direct number to a country on C5, you will usually
hear a very audible 'chirp' (some may choose to call it a 'ping' even...)
when the line is picked up.  This is the moment to start sending the tones
required to manipulate the line for your purposes.  A few countries using
C5 may not give you a 'chirp' when your call is connected, but when the
call is disconnected.  Before you can start to signal your call, you will
need to 'sieze a trunk'.  To do this you send a compound signal of 2600hz
and 2400hz for approx. 150-450ms.  On sending this signal the line should
respond with a sound similar to the one you heard when your call to the
country direct was completed.  Next you send a 2400hz signal, usually for
approximately the same length of time as the first compound signal.  The
delay between these two tones is often crucial, so experimentation is
essential.  There are no concrete rules for siezing a C5 line, although I
usually use 150ms length for both tones as a starting point.  If playing
the first tone leads to immediate disconnection then decrease the length of
the tone - if the opposite is the case, and the line ignores your first
signal, then increase its length (personally I use steps of 10ms but feel
free to jump up 50ms if you feel the urge).  BillSF of HackTic Holland
informs me that newer C5 systems nearly always require timings of 150ms per
signal +/-20ms, and with an inter-signal delay of 10/20ms, and I have also
found this to be true.  When you have successfully gained control of the
line, you will have by this time heard two acknowledgements from the line,
one per signal sent.  At this point you are ready to begin signalling your
call.  The first digit you must dial is the KP1 or KP2 signal.  This
determines that the call is either terminal (local), or transit
(international) respectively.  An international call is usually what we
want, so we send the following dialstring: KP2+countrycode+0+acn+ST.  For
example, if we wanted to dial the Colorado office of the Secret Service, we
would send KP2+103038661010+ST.  If we wanted to place a call to a number
in a European country then the dialing format is identical.  This is the
correct dialing format in accordance with all the technical CCITT 5 texts I
have read, but not always the correct method in practice.  Macao (country
code 853) was long known to be breakable from the United Kingdom before
anyone figured out that the correct routing was
KP2+00+countrycode+number+ST, so again the key word is experiment.  Not all
countries will 'play fair' in terms of their accepted routings.
	To place a call to within the country you are calling couldn't be
simpler however.  The correct format is KP1+0+number+ST, and I have never
found any nation deviating from this template.  One interesting route to
note at this point is KP1+2+Code11+ST (see freq. list for Code11), which
will nearly always connect you with the inward operator in the country
whose country direct number you have dialled.  Lots of interesting
information may be gleaned from a conversation with these operators, such
as correct routings, and most operators are more than willing to furnish
you with the routings for their technical assistance/engineering
departments, who will further assist you, often to the point of telling you
the exact timings you require.  Remember that their equipment is telling
them that you are an operator, so feel free to spin any suitable yarn about
testing international connections etc., and also bear in mind that in 99%
of cases the operator's limited grasp of the english language is in your
favour.
	Also, be prepared to try other digits in place of 0 between ccode and
number in the dialstring for a transit call.  KP2+ccode+2+number+ST will
usually work for example, and in some cases is the only way to route the
call (the country direct to Taiwan from the UK was a good example of this).
The digits 0,1,2 and 9 are the only ones I have found to be acceptable in
this way, but I wouldn't discount the possibility of being able to use
others over some nations.


<H3>"It doesn't work?"</H3>

Then you're doing something wrong.  Not all countries will allow you to
place transit calls over their lines so if you really have experimented
with that line and had little or no success then move on, there's no real
shortage of country direct numbers on C5...  You might want to try sending
a short burst of 2400hz previous to breaking/siezing the trunk to 'free'
the transit lines.  I have found this to be neccessary on the country
directs from the UK to Brazil and French Guiana in order to place a transit
call successfully.  Another thing to bear in mind is the fact that the
country you are trying to (ab)use may only call: a) Countries in close
proximity, and/or b) One or two countrycodes.  This is true of certain
lines in Canada, and also of most South American C5 links to the UK.  Trial
and error is the only way to establish if this is the case on any given
dialup.


<H3>"D3Y M0Ni+0R D3 LiN3Z" & "They have 2600hz detectors you know..."</H3>

Well, what can I say?  You never make use of a pure 2600hz tone, so even if
it IS filtered/detected you don't have to worry.  The most obvious way I
can see of being detected blueboxing is to make 10hrs of international
calls per day over whichever 1-800 direct you're using.  Very few telco's
are going to ignore 140 calls/day to Guyana Direct per month.  Use your
common sense to avoid detection, that's it.

(These are the C5 signalling frequencies I use nearly every day, so if you
spot an inaccuracy in the above frequency set you are cordially invited to
blend your phallic muscle...)<P>


Now to the timings.  All the normal digits (0-9) should be 55ms in length
and have a 55ms delay in accordance with the technical specificiations
laid out in the CCITT manuals.  However, in practice these timings may be
decreased to as little as 30ms per digit, perhaps even less in
exceptional cases.  The command and operator digits (KP1/2, ST, C11/12)
are usually 100ms in length, with the delay the same as that set for the
normal digits.  Certain South-American countries that I have (ab)used have
required that the command digits, more specifically the KeyPulse signals
and the ST, be much shorter than this, although usually still with a length
longer than that of digits 0-9.

That's all folks.  If you don't know how to produce these tones then you 
shouldn't really be reading this - go read your SimCity 2k docs...
