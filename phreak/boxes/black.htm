Black Box
-------------------- 
 

  HERE IS HOW YOU CONSTRUCT A BLACK BOX.
 
    WHEN YOUR PHONE IS JUST SITTING THERE DOING NOTHING THE
  VOLTAGE THROUGH THE PHONE LINE IS ZERO. THEN IF SOMEONE CALLS
  YOU (FOR SOME STRANGE REASON) AND THE PHONE IS RINGING. THE
  VOLTAGE JUMPS TO 48 VOLTS WHICH TELLS MA BELL TO STAND BY IF YOU
  SHOULD PICK UP SO SHE CAN BILL YOU. WHEN YOU EVENTUALLY PICK UP
  THE PHONE, THE VOLTAGE DROPS TO 10 VOLTS AND THE BILLING STARTS.
  WHAT A BLACK BOX DOES IS KEEPS THE THE VOLTAGE AS 36 VOLTS,
  THEREFORE THE INCOMING CALLER NEVER GETS BILLED (INGEINIOUS)
 
    THE ORIGINAL BLACK BOX WAS CREATED BY AN EX-BELL EMPLOYEE WHO
  WENT BY THE NAME "CAPTAIN CRUNCH". HE GOT HIS NAME FROM THOSE
  LITTLE WHISLES YOU GOT IN BOXES OF CAPTAIN CRUNCH BECAUSE THEY
  EMITED A TONE THAT WAS EQUAL TO A COIN.CAPTAIN CRUNCH JUST
  ANNOUNCED  HIS RETIREMENT FROM PHREAKING WHEN HE WAS RELEASED
  FROM A CALIFORNIA JAIL. HE WAS CAUGHT WITH A BLUE BOX.
 
   CONSTRUCTION OF A
    BLACK BOX
 
    1] A 36 VOLT ZENER DIODE.
    2] A CERAMIC OR MYLAR CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICROFARAD.
    3] A ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR OF 1.0 MICROFARAD.
 
   YOU CAN GET THESE AT YOUR LOCAL RADIO SHACK DEALER.
 
  FIRST YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP YOUR PHONE.YOU SHOULD NOTICE THREE
  WIRES COMING IN FROM THE BACK OF THE PHONE, A GREEN, RED, AND
  YELLOW. MOST OF THE TIME THEY CAN DIFFER.DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE
  YELLOW WIRE, WE WILL NOT BE USING THIS.YOU WILL NEED TO FIND THE
  MOST POSITIVE OF THE REMAINING TWO WIRES.(ALMOST ALWAYS THE
  GREEN WIRE). NOW CONNECT THE BANDED END OF THE ZENER DIODE TO
  THE MORE POSITIVE OF THESE TWO WIRES. "IN SERIES". YOU HAVE JUST
  COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP.  FOR THE SECOND STEP YOU NEED A
  CERAMIC OR MYLAR CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICROFARAD. YOU CONNECT THIS
  "IN PARRALLEL" ACROSS THE DIODE. THIS IS NEEDED TO ALLOW THE
  DIODE TO PASS VOICE SIGNALS.  NOW FOR THE FINAL STEP TAKE YOUR
  ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR OF UP TO ONE MICROFARAD WITH ITS '+' END
  CONNECTED TO THE BANDED END OF THE DIODE AND THE OTHER END
  SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE ANODE END OF THE DIODE. MA BELL IS
  NOT TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO THIS.IF THE PHONE RINGS FOR ABOUT A
  HALF-HOUR THEY WILL THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG AND BILL YOU
  ANYWAY.  WHEN USING A BLACK BOX,YOUR PHONE WILL CONTINUE RING
  EVEN THOUGH YOU PICKED IT UP. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SWITCH TO
  CONNECT ONE OF THE RINGER WIRES.THAT WILL SHUT IT OFF. THAT'S
  IT! HAVE PHUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  To all who dare --

     What is a BLACK BOX?   A BLACK BOX
is  a device that is hooked up to  your
fone  that fixes your fone so that when
you get a call,  the caller doesn't get
charged for the call.  This is good for
calls  up to 1/2 hour,  after 1/2  hour
the Fone Co.  gets suspicious, and then
you can guess what happens.

The way it works:

     What  this little beauty  does  is
keep the line voltage from dropping  to
10v  when  you answer your  fone.   The
line is insted kept at 36v and it  will
make  the  fone think that it is  still
ringing while your talking.  The reason
for the 1/2 hour time limit is that the
Fone CO. thinks that something is wrong
after 1/2 an hour of ringing.

     All  parts  are  available   Radio
Shack.   Using the least possible parts
and arangement,  the cost is $0.98 !!!!
And  that  is  parts for two  of  them!
Talk  about  a deal!   If you  want  to
splurge  then  you can get a  small  PC
board,  and  a switch.   There are  two
schematics  for this box,  one  is  for
most  normal fones.   The second one is
for  fones  that don't  work  with  the
first.  It was made for use with a Bell
Trimline touch tone fone.

connect together for the switch.

     Here is the PC board layout that I
recommend  using.   It  is neat and  is
very easy to hook up.

  **************     ****************


     Once you have hooked up all  the
parts,  you must figure out what set of
wires  go to the line and which  go  to
the fone.   This is because of the fact
that LED's must be put in, in a certain
direction.  Depending  on which way you
put the LED is what controls what wires
are for the line & fone.

How to find out:

     Hook  up the box in one  direction
using one set of wires for line and the
other for fone.

*NOTE*  For Model I switch should be
OFF.
*NOTE*  For Model ][ switch  should  be
        set to side connecting the led.

     Once  you have hooked it up,  then
pick up the fone and see if the LED  is
on.  If it is, the LED will be lit.  If
is  doesn't light then switch the wires
and try again.  Once you know which are
which  then label  them.   *NOTE*  - If
neither  directions  worked  then  your
switch was in the wrong position.   Now
lable   the   switch  in  its   current
position as BOX ON.

How to use it:

     The purpose of this box is not  to
poeple  who  call you so it would  make
sence  that  it  can only  be  used  to
receive! calls.   When the box is  *ON*
then you may only recieve calls.   Your
fone will ring like normal and the  LED
on  the box will flash.   If you answer
the fone now, then the LED will
light and the caller will not be
charged.
Hang  up  the fone after you  are  done
talking like normal.   You will not  be
able  to  get a dial-tone or call  when
the  box is on,  so turn the box  *OFF*
for  normal calls.   I don't  recommend
that you leave it on all the  time,  as
you don't want it to answer when Ma
Bell calls!

PLEASE NOTE THE BLACK BOX WILL NOT
FUNCTION UNDER MOST NEWER ESS SWITCHING
SYSTEMS.....
