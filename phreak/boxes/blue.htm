Blue Box
--------------------

  THIS IS THE TONE MATRIX FOR A BOX WHICH GENERATES TONES THAT
  OPERATORS USE TO DIAL.ROTARY WORKS AS WELL, ON OPERATOR LINES,
  BUT THIS IS TECHNOLOGICAL(!).  NOW I AGREE WITH THE OPINION OF A
  WELL KNOWN PHREAK THAT 'BOXING' IS/WILL BE FOR THE MOST PART
  DEAD, BUT THIS IS TRADITION... FIRST,YOU DIAL DIR.ASST, OR AN
  OPER. ETC, THEN YOU BLAST TE LINE WITH A 2600HZ TONE. THIS GIVES
  YOU THE LINE, THIS IS ALSO HOW MA BELL TRACKS DOWN BLUE
  BOXERS...  THERE  ARE 2600HZ DETECTORS SYSTEMS, AND EVEN ON OLD
  #4 CROSSBARS... ONCE ON A OPER.TRUNK LINE, YOU USE YOUR BLUE
  BOX/ROTARY TO DIAL...  SO,  IF YOU USE2600HZ, WHICH IS
  NECESSARY, UNLESS YOU ARE *VERY* CAREFUL, YOU WILL BE SNAGGED.
  FINALLY, THIS IS WHAT YOU READ!SO LONG AND HARD FOR:

  USE KP TO START A CALL, AND ST TO STOP, WITH THE BELOVED 2600HZ
  TONE TO DISCONNECT.  I ALSO HEAR THAT 2600HZ RESETS SPRINT NODES
  AND GIVES YOU THEIR INITIAL TONE..  NOW, IF YOU'RE WONDERING
  ABOUT WHAT TO CALL FROM AN OPERATOR TRUNK, HERE ARE SOME GOODIES

                        Blue Boxes, Part II
 
 
       While  reading  the fine article on the blue box I saw  that
  there a lot of data left out of the document.   I hope this adds,
  in some small way, to the information.
       First the tones.   While all the informatio is correct, the
  timing specs were not included.   The tone pairs are to remain on
  for 1/10 sec. with 1/10 sec. of slience between digits.  The 'KP'
  tones  should be sent for 2/10 sec.   A way to defeat the  2600hz
  traps  is to send along with the 2600z some pink  noise(most  of
  the  energy  in this signal should be above 3000hz,  this  signal
  won't make it over the toll network,  but should carry as far  as
  your  local  toll  center) so that the traps  won't  find  'pure'
  2600hz  on the trunk.   Ths is not a perfectly safe way to  box,
  but it should slow down the discovery.
       As  to use,  the first thing you need to understand is  that
  there  are  two(2)  types of toll completing  trunk,  inward  and
  outward.  The names are reference to the ofice that is switching
  the  call(The toll center that serves the WATS line  you  called)
  and each type of trunk has a different class of service.  From an
  inward toll completing trunk, you can reach the different service
  operators,  the toll test board  and the Inward Operator.   Some
  offices also allow remote testing and it is in these offices that
  you  can access the outward toll completing trunks.   The Outward
  trunks  allow  you  to  make  Verification(emergency)  calls,  do
  service  monitoring(tapping),  stack trunks(busy out  all  trunks
  between  LA and NYC),  enable and disable TSPS positions,  and in
  some cases(on some 4A's) issue temporary rerouting instructions(
  send  all calls from LA to NYC via Miami,  Boston,  or any  other
  class  5  office or offices).   Both type of trunk allow  you  to
  place a 'standard' call with a box.
       In  some  offices,  mostly the small ones with a  toll  test
  board that is unattended at night and on weekends, you can get an
  outward  toll completing tUh oh...

--------------------

WE ALL KNOW THAT THE TOUCH TONES FREQUENCIES ARE COMPOSED
OF TWO TONES (TWO DIFFERENT FREQS.) SO THAT IS THE REASON
WHY WE HAVE 2 VCO'S ( VOLTAGE CONTROLLED OSCILLATORS). WE
WILL CALL THESE VCO#1 AND VCO#2. IF YOU HAVE NOTICED
VCO#1 AND VCO#2 ARE EXACTLY THE SAME TYPE OF CIRCUITS.
THAT IS WHY ONLY ONE WAS DRAWN. BUT REMEMBER THAT WHATEVER
GOES FOR VCO#1 ALSO GOES FOR VCO#2. BOTH VCO'S ARE COMPOSED
OF A HANDFULL OF PARTS. ONE CHIP TWO CAPACITORS 2 RESISTORS
AND FIVE POTENTIOMETERS. ALL OF THIS WILL GIVE YOU (WHEN PROPERLY
CALIBRATED) ONE OF THE FREQS. NECESSARY (THE OTHER ONE WILL
COME FROM VCO#2) FOR THE OPERATION OF THE BB. BOTH OF THESE
FREQS. WILL BE MIXED IN THE SPEAKER THUS FORMING THE REQUIRED
TONE.
 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED DESIGNS I HAVE EVER MADE.
WHY?. BECAUSE OTHER DESIGNS WILL DRAIN THE BATTERY AFTER 10 -
CALLS! THIS DESIGN WILL MAKE THEM LAST 10 MONTHS!!!!!!. BUT
NEVERTHELESS DON'T FORGET TO PUT IN A SWITCH FOR ON AND OFF.
 OK LET'S BUILD THE TWO VCO'S AND CALIBRATE THE UNIT BEFORE
WE GET TO THE KEYBOARD CONTRUCTION. 
 
                       VCO CONTRUCTION
                       === ===========
  TOOLS REQUIRED
 
 1 OSCILLOSCOPE    (RECOMMENDED BUT NOT REQUIRED)
 1 FREQ. COUNTER   (REQUIRED)
 1 VOLT METER       "  "  "
  ELECTRONICS TOOLS  (PLIERS, DRILL, SCREWDRIVERS, ETC)
 
 
      PARTS
 
 R1    1.5K RESISTOR  5%
 R2    1K   RESISTOR  5%
 C1    .1UF ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR   16VDC
 C2    .01UF ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR (MYLAR) 16VDC
 IC1   2207  VCO CHIP  BY EXAR ELECTRINICS
 REMEMBER THE ABOVE IT IS ONLY FOR VCO#1 BUT THE SAME GOES FOR
 VCO#2.
 
  R3-R4  150 OHM RESISTORS  5%
  C3-C4   .1 UF  ELECTROLITIC CAPACITOR   10VDC
  P1-P10 200K TRIMMER POT - 20 TURNS
  DIODES USED IN THE KEYBOARD ARE 1N914 TYPE (40 OF THEM)
  AND 13 SWITCHES FOR THE KEYBOARD SPST. MOMENTARY.
 
  SPKR= YOU CAN USE A TELEPHONE SPEAKER FOR THIS(IT WORKS BEST)
        BUT REMEMBER TO TAKE OUT THE DIODE THAT IS CONNECTED
        ACCROSS IT.
****************************************************************
                 IMPORTANT NOTES
 
   1 DO NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE THAN A MYLAR CAPACITOR FOR C2
   2 PINS 10,9,8 SHOULD BE TIED TOGETHER AND BE LEFT  FLOATING.
   3 ALL RESISTOR SHOULD BE 5%! NOTHING ELSE
   4 A TELEPHONE SPEAKER GIVES THE BEST RESULTS
*****************************************************************
 
 
                TROUBLE SHOOTING
 
 BY NOW YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSTRUCTED THE TWO VCO'S
ON A BREAD BOARD OR ANYTHING THAT PLEASES YOU.
 
 CHECK FOR COLD SOLDER JOINTS, BROKEN WIRES, POLARITY
OF THE BATTERY, ETC.........
 
 BEFORE WE APPLY POWER TO THE VCO'S WE HAVE TO ADJUST THE POTS
FOR THEIR HALF WAY TRAVEL POINT. THIS IS DONE BY TURNING THEM
21 TURNS TO THE RIGHT AND THEN 10 TURNS TO THE LEFT. DO THE
SAME FOR ALL TEN OF THEM.
 
NOW APPLY POWER TO THE UNIT CHECK TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE POWER
IN THE CHIPS BY PUTTING THE POSITIVE LEAD OF YOUR VOLT METER
ON PIN 7 AND THE NEGATIVE LEAD ON PIN 12. IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING THERE TURN OFF THE UNIT ANT RECHECK THE WIRING.
 
WHEN YOU GET THE RIGHT VOLTAGES ON THE CHIPS, CONNECT A
DIODE TO A PIECE OF WIRE (LOOK AT FIG. 2 FOR THE ORIENTATION
OF THE DIODE) FROM GROUND TO ANY POT AT POINT T (LOOK CAREFULLY
AT THE SCHEMATIC FOR POINT T IT IS LABELED T1-T10 FOR ALL POTS)
 YOU SHOLD BE ABLE TO HEAR A TONE, IF NOT DISSCONNECT THE LEAD
AND PLACE THE SPEAKER CLOSE TO YOUR EAR AND IF YOU HEAR A CHIRP
LIKE SOUND, THIS MEANS THAT THE TWO VCO'S ARE WORKING IF YOU DON'T,
IT MEANS THAT EITHER ONE OR BOTH OF THE VCO'S IS DEAD.
SO IN THIS CASE IT IS ALLWAYS GOOD TO HAVE AN OSCILLOSCOPE ON HAND.
 
 DISCONNECT THE SPEAKER FROM THE CIRCUIT AND HOOKUP THE OCILLISCOPE
TO ONE OF THE LEADS OF THE SPEAKER AND THE GROUND FROM THE SCOPE
TO THE GROUND OF THE BATTERY. CONNECT AGAIN THE GROUND LEAD
WITH THE DIODE CONNECTED TO IT FROM GROUND TO ANY POT ON THE
VCO THAT YOU ARE CHECKING AND YOU SHOULD SEE A TRIANGLE WAVE
IF NOT TURN THE POT IN WICH YOU ARE APPLYING THE GROUND TO
QUNTIL YOU SEE IT. WHEN YOU DO SEE IT DO THE THE SAME FOR THE
OTHER VCO TO MAKE SURE IT IS WORKING. (AMPLITUDE IS ABOUT 2VAC)
WHEN YOU GET THE TWO VCO'S WORKING YOU ARE SET FOR THE ADJUSTMENT
OF THE INDIVIDUALS POTS...
 
                       ADJUSTMENT
 
 
   DISCONNECT THE SPEAKER FROM THE CIRCUIT AND CONNECT A FREQ.
COUNTER (THE POSITIVE LEAD OF THE COUNTER TO ONE OF THE SPEAKERS
LEADS THAT BELONGS TO VCO#1 OR CONNECT IT TO PIN 14).
 
   CONNECT THE NEGATIVE LEAD TO THE BATTERY NEGATIVE AND
CONNECT THE JUMPER LEAD WITH THE DIODE FROM GROUND TO POT NUMBER 1
T1 .( THE FIRST POT NUMBER 1 POINT T1)
 IF YOU GOT IT WORKING YOU SHOULD HEAR A TONE AND GET A READING ON THE
COUNTER.  ADJUST THE POT FOR A FREQ. OF 1700HZ AND CONTINUE DOING THE
SAME FOR POTS 2-5 EXCEPT THAT THEY GET DIFFERENTS FREQS.
 
 
                    P1= 1700HZ
                    P2= 1300HZ
                    P3= 1100HZ
                    P4=  900HZ
                    P5= 1500HZ
 
 NOW DISCONNECT THE FREQ. COUNTER FROM THE SPEAKER LEAD OF VCO#1 OR
FROM PIN 14 (WHICH EVER YOU HAD IT ATTACHED TO AT THE BEGINNING) AND
CONNECT IT TO THE SPEAKER LEAD OF VCO#2 OR TO PIN 14 OF VCO#2 AND
PERFORM THE SAME ADJUSTMENTS TO P6-10.
 
                    P6= 1100HZ
                    P7=  700HZ
                    P8=  900HZ
                    P9=  2600HZ   MAGIC NUMBER!!!!!
                    P10= 1500HZ
 
  WHEN YOU FINISH DOING ALL OF THE POT GO BACK AND RECHECK THEM
AGAIN.
 
 
                 KEYBOARD
 IF YOU LOOK AT FIG-2 YOU WILL SEE THAT THE KEYS ARE SIMPLE SWITCHES
CONNECTED TO GROUND AND TWO DIODES ON THE OTHER END. THESE DIODES
ARE USED TO SIMPLIFY THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE KEYBOARD BECAUSE OTHERWISE
THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GROUND SIGNAL FOR BOTH VCO'S WOULD HAVE BEEN
DONE MECHANICALLY.  ONE DIODE WILL GO TO VCO#1 AND THE OTHER WILL GO TO
VCO#2. FIG-3 SHOWS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD.
 
 
          DBELOW IS A TABLE THAT WILL HELP YOU CONNECT
 THE KEYS TO REQUIRED VCO'S POTS.

      THIS IS A DIAGRAM OF HOW TO LOCATE THE DIFFERENT PINS ON THE
 CHIP PLEASE NOTICE THAT PIN ONE IS THE CLOSEST TO THE NOTCH ON TOP
 OF THE CHIP.  THE FIRST THING WE'LL DO IS TO CONNECT POWER TO THE
 CHIP  (REMEMBER  THAT  YOU NEED TO BUILD TWO OF THESE  TO  GET  A
 COMPLETE  SYSTEM) THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CONNECTING THE POSITIVE
 WIRE OF THE BATTERY LEAD TO PIN 1 ONE LEG OF R1 AND R2 IS  SOLDER
 TO PIN 11 THE OTHER LEG OF R1 GOES TO PIN 1 OR TO THE POSITIVE OF
 THE BATTERY.   THE OTHER LEG OF R2 GOES TO GROUND, C1 GOES BETWEEN
 PIN 10 AND GROUND.
  THE TIMING CAPACITOR OR C2 GOES BETWEEN PINS 2 AND 3 OF THE CHIP
 PINS 8 AND 9 SHOULD BE GROUNDED TO GROUND.  PIN 14 IS THE OUT PUT
 AND  THIS  IS WHERE ONE LEG OF C4 (C3 GOES ON THE OTHER  VCO)  IN
 SERIES  WITH R3(THE SAME GOES FOR THE OTHER VCO) AND TO ONE  LEAD
 OF THE SPEAKER.
 
 
      THE TRIMMER POTS P1 TO P10 SHOULD BE GROUPED IN GROUPS OF  5
 POTS  EACH. THE WAY YOU GROUP IT IS BY SOLDERING ONE END OF THE
 POT TO EACH OTHER LEAVING THE WIPER AND THE OTHER END FREE.
 
                    ] THIS END GOES TO PIN 6 OF THE CHIP

This Blue Box is based on the Exar 2207 Voltage Controlled Oscillator.
There are other ways to build Blue Boxes, some being better and some not as
good, but I chose to do it this way.  My reason for doing so: because at the
time I started this project, about the only schematic available on BBS's was
the one written by Mr. America and Nickie Halflinger.  Those plans soon (in
about 90 seconds) became very vague in their context with a couple in-
consistencies, but I decided to "rough it out" using those plans (based on the
Exar 2207 VCO) and build the Blue Box using that as my guide.  During the
construction of the Blue Box, I decided to type-up a "more complete and clear"
set of Blue Box schematics than the file that I based mine on, in order to help
others who may be trying/thinking of building a Blue Box.  I hope these help.

Note:  You should get a copy of the Mr. America/Nickie Halflinger Blue Box
plans.  Those plans may be of help to anyone who may have difficulty
understanding these plans.  Also, these plans currently do not support CCITT.

+---------------------------------+
| Why should I build a Blue Box ? |
+---------------------------------+

    Many of you may have that question, and here's my answer. Blue Boxing was
the origin of phreaking (excluding whistling). Without the advent of Blue
Boxes, I feel that some of the advances in the telecommunications industry
would've taken longer to develop (The need to stop the phone phreaks forced
AT+T Bell Laboratories to "step up" their development to stop those thieves!).
There is no harm in building a Blue Box (except the knowledge you will
gain in the field of electronics).  Although there are software programs (Soft
Blue Boxes) available for many micro's that will produce the Blue Box
Multi-Frequency (MF) tones, they are not as portable as an actual Blue Box (you
can't carry your computer to a telephone, so you must use it from home which
could possibly lead to danger).
Many phreaks are announcing the end of the Blue Box Era, but due to
discoveries I have made (even on ESS 1A and possibly ESS 5), I do not believe
this to be true.  Although many people consider Blue Boxing "a pain in the
ass", I consider Blue Boxing to be "phreaking in its' purest form".  There is
much to learn on the current fone network that has not been written about, and
Blue Boxes are necessary for some of these discoveries.  The gift of free fone
calls tends to be a bonus.

Note: Blue Boxes also make great Christmas gifts!

+---------------------------------------+
| Items needed to construct a Blue Box. |
+---------------------------------------+
Here is the list of items you will need and where you can get them.  It
may be a good idea to gather some of the key parts (the chips, and especially
the potentiometers, they took about 6 months to back order through Digi-key.  A
whole 6 fucking months!) before you start this project.  Also, basic
electronics tools will be necessary, and you might want to test the circuit on
a bread board, then wire-wrap the final project. Also, you will need a box of
some sort to put it in (like the blue plastic kind at Radio Shack that cost
around $5.00).

Note: An oscilliscope should be used when tuning in the
potentiometers because the Bell system allows
only a 7-10% tolerance in the precision of the
frequencies.

The resistors should be a +/- 5% tolerance.
The speaker can be from a regular telephone (mine just happened to be from
an old Autovon phone).  But make sure that you remove the diode.
The Potentiometers should have a 100K Ohm range (but you may want to make
the calculations yourself to double check).
The 9-volt battery can be obtained for free if you use your Radio Shack
Free Battery Club card.
The Exar 2207 VCO can be found if you call the Exar Corp. located in
Sunnyvale, California.  Call them, and tell them the state you live in, and
they'll give the name and phone number to the distributor that is located
closest to you. The 2207 will vary from about $3.00 for the silicon-grade
(which is the one you'll want to use) to about $12.00 for the high-grade
Military chip.
Note:  When you call Exar, you may want to ask them to send you the
spec-sheets that gives greater detail as to the operation and construction of
the chip.

| Multiplex Keypad System |
+-------------------------+

First, the multiplex pattern used in the 4x4 keypad layout. I suggest that
keys 0-9 be used as the Blue Box's 0-9 keys, and then you can assign A-D, *, #
keys to your comfort (ie. * = Kp, # = St, D = 2600, and A-C as Kp1, Kp2   or
however you want).

Note: On your 2600 Hz. key (The D key in example above)
it may be a good idea to tune in a second
potentiometer to 3700 Hz. (Pink Noise).

This is just one way to build a Blue Box.  If you choose this way, then I
hope this file is adequate enough to aid you in the construction.  Although
these are not the best plans, they do work. This file does not tell you how to
use it or what to do once it's built.  For that information I mention that you
read Mark Tabas's "Better Homes and Blue Boxing" files, or any other files/BBS
subboards that deal with that realm.
If you need help, I sluggest (thanks for that one Taran) that you ask a
close friend, possibly an electronics teacher, or a phreak friend to help you.
Also, if you need help or have questions or comments about this file, you can
address them to me.  I can be contacted through the LOD/H Technical Journal
Staff account on the boards listed in the Intro, or on the few boards I call.

REMEMBER TOTAKE OUT THE DIODE THAT IS CONNECTED ACCROSS IT.


IMPORTANT NOTES

1. DO NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN A MYLAR CAPACITOR FORC2.
2. PINS 10,9,8 SHOULD BE TIED TOGETHER AND BE LEFT FLOATING.
3. ALL RESISTORS SHOULD BE 5%!  NOTHING ELSE!
4. A TELEPHONE SPEAKER GIVES THE BEST RESULTS.


TROUBLE SHOOTING

By now you should have constructed the two VCO'S on a bread board
or anything that pleases you.  Check for cold solder
joints,broken wires,polarity of the battery, etc.  Before we
apply power to the VCO'S we have to adjust the pots for their
half way travel point.  This is done by turning them 21 turns to
the right and then 10 turns to the left.  Do the same for all ten
of them.

Now apply power to the unit check to see that you have power in
the chips by putting the positive lead of your volt meter on pin
7 andthe negative lead on pin 12.  If you do not have anything
there turn off the unit and RECHECK THE WIRING.

When you get the right voltages on the chips, connect a diode to
a piece of wire (look at fig. 2 for the orientation of the diode)
from round to any pot at point T (look carefully at the schematic
for point T it is labeled T1-T10 for all pots). You should be
able to hear a tone, if not disconnect the lead and place the
speaker close to your ear and if you hear a chirp-like sound,
this means that the two VCO'S are working if you don't,
it means that either one or both of the VCO'S are dead.  So in
this case it is always good to have an ocilloscope on hand.
Disconnect the speaker from the circuit and hook the ocilliscope
to 1 of the leads of the speaker & the ground from the scope to
the ground of the battery. Connect again the ground lead with the
diode connected to it  from ground to any pot on the VCO that you
are checking and you should see a triangle wave if not turn the
pot in which you are applying the ground to until you see it.
When you do see it do the the same for the other VCO to makesure
it is working. (amplitude is about 2VAC). When you get the two
VCO's working you are set for the adjustment of the individual
spots.


ADJUSTMENT

Disconnect the speaker from the circuit and connect a freq.
counter (the positive lead of the counter to one of the speakers
leads that belongs to VCO#1 or connect it to pin 14.

Connect the negative lead to the battery negative and connect the
jumperlead with the diode from ground to pot number 1.T1 (the
first pot number 1 point T1).  If you got it working you should
hear a tone and get a reading on the counter.  Adjust the pot for
a  freq. of 1700hz and continue doing the same for pots 2-5
except that they get different freqs. which are:

:            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$           :
:            $            $           :
:            $ P1 1700hz  $           :
:            $ P2 1300hz  $           :
:            $ P3 1100hz  $           :
:            $ P4  900hz  $           :
:            $ P5 1500hz  $           :
:            $            $           :
:            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$           :

Now disconnect the freq. counter from the speaker lead of VCO#1
or from pin (which ever you had it attached to at the beginning)
and connect it to the speaker lead of VCO#2 or to pin 14 of VCO#2
and make the same adjustments toP6-10.:

:            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$          :
:            $             $          :
:            $ P6  1100hz  $          :
:            $ P7   700hz  $          :
:            $ P8   900hz  $          :
:            $ P9  2600hz  $          :
:            $ P10 1500hz  $          :
:            $             $          :
:            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$          :

When you finish doing all of the pots go back and re-check
them.


KEYBOARD

IF YOU LOOK AT FIG-2 YOU WILL SEE THAT THE KEYS ARE
SIMPLE SWITCHES. CONNECTED TO A GROUND AND TWO DIODES ON THE
OTHER END. THESE DIODES ARE USED TO SIMPLIFY THE CONSTRUCTION OF
THE KEYBOARD BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GROUND
SIGNAL FOR BOTH VCO'S WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE MECHANICALLY.  THE
DIODE WILL GO TO VCO#1 AND THE OTHER WILL GO TO VCO#2. FIG-3
SHOWS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD.

BELOW IS A TABLE THAT WILL HELP YOU CONNECT THE KEYS TO THE
REQUIRED VCO'SPOTS.
