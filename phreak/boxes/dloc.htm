  STUFF YOU'LL NEED:
  ------------------

  A SOLDERING IRON
  A SPOOL OF LOW RESISTANCE WIRE
  2 FEMALE FONE JACKS
  2 SPST TOGGLE SWITCHES
  4 GOLD PLATED ALLIGATOR CLIPS
  A BOX TO PUT IT ALL IN
  SOME SOLDER
  A BRAIN

  HERE'S A SIMPLE DIAGRAM OF HOW IT IS
  PUT TOGETHER:

                   @            @
  KEY:             G            R

                   G            R
                   G            R
                   G            R
                   G            R
                   G            R
                   @            @

  ASSEMBLE IT AS ABOVE, AND PUT IT IN THE BOX, WITH THE TOGGLE
  SWITCHES PARALLEL, AND THE FEMALE JACKS MOUNTED ON EITHER SIDE
  OF THE BOX. OR, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE TROUBLE OF MAKING
  IT BY YOURSELF, YOU CAN GET ONE FOR $7.50 FROM DLOC. OURS ARE
  ENCASED IN A STURDY PLASTIC BOX, WITH OUR LOGO STENCILED ON THE
  SIDE, AND ARE VERY WELL MADE. IF YOU WANT TO BUY ONE, CONTACT A
  DLOC MEMBER ON ONE OF THE BOARDS LISTED BELOW IN THIS FILE.

  DLOC BOX FUNCTIONS:
  -------------------

  HOOKUP: TO HOOK UP THE BOX, PLUG YOUR FONES INTO THE JACKS ON
  THE BOX. ON MINE, THE WIRES ARE LABELED EVERY FOOT SO THAT I
  KNOW WHICH TRUNK I'M ON. CLIP THE APPROPRIATE SET OF CLIPS ON
  THE TERMINALS YOU WISH TO INVADE, AND THEN LISTEN/DIAL THROUGH
  WHICHEVER PHONE IS CONNECTED. THIS BOX HAS TWO LINES GOING
  THROUGH IT, WITH AN OPTION TO CONFER- ENCE THE TWO. I ADDED THIS
  SO IF WHILE ON ALLIANCE TELECONFERENCING, YOU WANT TO DIAL AN
  800,900,700, OR 976 NUMBER, YOU CAN SIMPLY DIAL IT WITH THE
  OTHER TRUNK AND THEN CONFERENCE THE TWO.

  CONFERENCING THE TWO LINES: TO JOIN THE TWO LINES, TURN BOTH OF
  THE TOGGLE SWITCHES TO THE ON POSITION.

  NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT NO PHONE IS CONNECTED TO THE BOX WHEN YOU
  HOOK UP THE CLIPS, AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH SWITCHES ARE
  TURNED OFF.
