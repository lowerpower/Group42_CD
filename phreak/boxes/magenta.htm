Magenta Box
--------------------

  First of all I named this the Magenta Box because all of the
  fags that made boxes, whose only purpose is adding a hold
  button to your phone, used all of the fucking colors.  I can
  afford a fucking piece of shit Radio Shack 2-line phone with
  hold.  A box's purpose is to mess with the Telco., not to add
  a fucking hold button to your phone.  Anyway I will get on with
  this.

  PARTS LIST:
               SPDT Miniature PC RELAY (about 9v, 500 ohm)
               DPDT Miniature PC RELAY (about 6v, 500 ohms, 12 mA)
               2000 or so uF electrolytic capacitor
               1 meg resistor
               .01 uF capacitor
               2    555 timer chip
               2 diodes (1N914)
               10 K resistor
               1 K resistor

  If you don't know how to put together a project by looking at a
  schematic, then isn't the project to start with.  I would ask someone
  with some electronics knowledge to give you a helping hand.  This
  has to be put together on a pc-board.
  Enough talk, now the schematic:

  Whew!  Well, the schematic explains almost everything.  It would be
  helpful to you if you used one color for the line #1 clips and another
  for the line #2 clips.  It will work even if you get the ring and tip
  mixed up, but you must get all of the clips on the right line.  But,
  to be safe, you could put tags on each clip labeling it RING #1, TIP #2,
  ect.

  Installation.  Find one of those green posts that are about 3 feet high.
  They are everywhere.  Get a socket wrench to open it up.  There will
  be (a) row(s) of paired up posts.  Each pair of posts represents a line.
  YOU *MUST* KNOW THE NUMBER OF LINE #1.  Sometimes the number is tagged
  on to the pair of wires leading up to the posts, if so pick these posts
  as your line #1.  Then you can pick any other set of posts for line #2.

  Now to the good part.  Use of the the final product.  When you call up
  line one from your house you will get a dial tone almost immediately.
  Using DTMF you can dial anywhere that the person who owns line 2 has
  service to.  Which means you can direct dial alliance, Australia, and
  your favorite BBS for FREE.

  The Telco. will undoubtably discover the device after 2 days, so post
  the number on your favorite boards so you can abuse it while it is in
  service.  With a 2000 uF capacitor and a 1 meg resistor you will
  get a 50 minute call before it disconnects you.  By lowering the value
  of the resistor and capacitor you can change the time to your taste.
  So don't dial a wrong number, because you will have to wait 50 minutes
  until it resets again.  The formula for the time is the following:

  2*R1    C1              C1 is in microfarads
  ---- * ----             R1 is in Kohms
  100     10              See schematic for location of R1 and C1.
  -----------  = Minutes
      60

  The time produced by this formula is only approximate.

  Well, that is one of the more complicated boxes to build.  But it
  is very useful and will pay for itself with its first use.   It
  would be wise to remove it before the Telco. finds it so you won't
  have to make another, or install it on a line that belongs to a
  family that is on vacation (GOOD IDEA)

  Well, there it is.  I hope it saves you a lot of cash.


  If you wish to have one built for you.  Leave me E-mail on the Iron Curtain
  or the CornerStone or any other board I frequent.  It won't be more than $15,
  hopefully it will only be about $8.

    This is a portable ringing generator which, if connected to a phone
    line, will make the phone on the end of it ring. It works by using a
    relay as a vibrator to generate A.C. which is then stepped up by a
    transformer and fed through a capacitor into the phone line to make the
    phone ring!

    YOU WILL NEED:

    One 5V relay with single pole change-over (SPCO) contacts
    One 6-0-6V mains transformer {KEZ SEZ: US users see text for mod.}
    Two 2uF 250V non-electrolytic capacitors
    One 6V lantern battery
    One push-to-make switch
    Wire

    HOW TO MAKE IT:

    The circuit diagram shows the relay in the normal state, ie when
    current is NOT Flowing!

    HOW TO USE IT:

    Connect the output wires to a suitable beige boxing point on a phone
    line. {or use a modular plug - middle two pins of the US type, outer
    two pins of the four-way UK type}

    HOW IT WORKS:

    The telephone ringing voltage is about 90V rms, which is about 255V
    peak to peak. This circuit feeds 6V peak to peak into the 6V winding of
    a transformer, which should generate 240V peak to peak in the 240V
    primary. {So in America you will have to use a 3-0-3V transformer to
    get the right step-up ratio, as your mains voltage is only 120V.} The
    relay is wired through its own contacts. At first a current flows, so
    the contacts change over and the battery current now flows into the
    transformer instead of the relay coil. This produces a pulse of current
    in the other winding, which flows through the capacitors and into the
    phone line. Meanwhile, the relay isn't connected any more and so flies
    back. This produces a pulse of current in the opposite direction on the
    mains side of the transformer. Any phone on the line will ring while
    the switch is held closed. With practice you should be able to emulate
    the ringing sound perfectly! It will certainly confuse a few people!
