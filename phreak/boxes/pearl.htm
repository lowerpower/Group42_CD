Pearl Box
-------------------- 
 
The Pearl Box:Definition - This is a box that may substitute for many boxes
which produce tones in hertz. The Pearl Box when operated correctly can pro-
duce tones from 1-9999hz. As you can see, 2600, 1633, 1336 and other crucial
tones are obviously in its sound spectrum.
 
Materials you will need in order to build The Pearl Box:
========================================================
C1, C2::::::::.5mf or .5uf ceramic disk capacitors
Q1::::::::::::NPN transistor (2N2222 works best)
S1::::::::::::Normally open momentary SPST switch
S2::::::::::::SPST toggle switch
B1::::::::::::Standard 9-Volt battery
R1::::::::::::Single turn, 50k potentiometer
R2::::::::::::  "     "    100k potentiometer
R3::::::::::::  "     "    500k potentiometer
R4::::::::::::  "     "    1meg potentiometer
SPKR::::::::::Standard 8-ohm speaker
T1::::::::::::Mini transformer (8-ohm works best)
Misc.:::::::::Wire, solder, soldering iron, PC board or perfboard, box to
              contain the completed unit, battery clip
 
Instructions for building The Pearl Box:
========================================
 
Since the instruction are EXTREMELY difficult to explain in words, you will be
given a schematic instead. It will be quite difficult to follow but try it any
way. There is also a Hi-Res picture you can get that shows the schematic in
great detail.

Now that you are probably thoroughly confused, let me explain a few minor de-
tails. The potentiometer area is rigged so that the left pole is connected to
the center pole of the potentiometer next to it. The middle terminal of T1 is
connected to the piece of wire that runs down to the end of the battery.
 
Correct operation of The Pearl Box:
===================================
You may want to get some dry-transfer decals at Radio Shack to make this job a
lot easier. Also, some knobs for the tops of the potentiometers may be useful
too. Use the decals to calibrate the knobs.
R1 is the knob for the ones place, R2 is for the tens place, R3 if for the
hundreds place and R4 is for the thousands place. S1 is for producing the all
the tones and S2 is for power.
Step 1: Turn on the power and adjust the knobs for the desired tone.
       (Example: For 2600 hz- R1=0:R2=0:R3=6:R4=2)
Step 2: Hit the pushbutton switch and VWALA! You have the tone. If you don't
  have a tone recheck all connections and schematic.

INTRO:  After reading the fucked up shit on the original pearl box, I decided
        that there was an easier and cheaper way of doing the same thing with
        an IC and parts you probably have just laying around the house.

PARTS:  CD4049 RCA intigrated circuit
        .1 uF disk capacitor
        1 uF 16V electrolitic capacitor
        1K resistor
        10K resistor
        1meg pot
        1N914 diode
        some SPST momentary pushbutton switches
        9 Volt battery & clip
        and miscalanious shit you should have laying around the house.

EXTRAS:
        To keep tones that you wanna use frequently like 1850 Hz then all you
        have to do is put in a variable resistor and adjust it to where you
        have the correct tone, then just put a push-putton switch on the line.
        You can link them together in a chain, etc.
