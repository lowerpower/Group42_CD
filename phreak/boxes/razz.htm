Razz Box
--------------------

  Introduction:

          So you want to be James Bond eh? So you want to be a private eye eh.
  Well here's your chance to pick up some very important clues or ideas using
  your neighbors telephone line. Forget about climbing a telephone pole this
  sort of boxing can be done on the ground.

  Purpose:

          To tap your neighbors line without your neighbor knowing it. You can
  also make FREE (let me repeat that) FREE!! Phone calls to your favorite
  K-RAD-GNEW-WAREZ boards.

  Materials:

  1. Line Man's headset (no you can't buy one that's why we're making one you
     IDIOT)
  2. Alligator clips (clips is Plural so you need Two)
  3. A phone (preferbly one of those one peice kind that like the ones with the
     numbers and the thing the hangs up on the ONE phone piece)
  4. A Telephone wall jack box or whatever they're called
  5. Some green and some red wire
  6. Some intelligence (very Much needed)

  Plans:

          First hook up your one piece phone to the wall jack box. Then take
  the alligator clips and attach red wire to one and green wire to the other
  one. You should have 2 alligator clips with wire attached. Now strip the
  wire and open the Wall jack box you have and attach the red wire with the
  red screw on the box and the green wire with the green screw on the box.
  Your stuff should look like this.

  Hints:
  \/\/\/- Green wire Alligator clip
  /\/\/\- Red   Wire Alligator Clip

  Using Your newly made device:

          Now that you have made or created your little Razz Box then you are
  ready to go outside and do your stuff. First go to a neighbor's house and
  find the black telephone wires. They should look like Example #1. Then cut
  off a bit of the plastic covering so the alligator clips go in easier and
  you now stick the alligator clips one on the right and one on the left side
  of the plastic wire as shown on the diagram. The Black plastic wire should
  look like the diagram. You should get a dialtone. If you do not then switch
  the alligator clips around till you do. Remember your neighbors can hear you
  as well so get one of the phones with the MUTE option so you can plug into
  theres quietly.
