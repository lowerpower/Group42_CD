Red Box
--------------------

  This article is presented as a news item only. It is not to be taken as an
  encouragement to make fraudulent telephone calls.

  Red boxing consists of simulating the tones produced when coins are
  deposited in a pay phone. Coin tones are beeps of 2200 Hz + 1700 Hz as
  follows:

  5 cents - 1 beep, 66 milliseconds duration.

  10 cents - 2 beeps, each 66 milliseconds duration with 66 millisecond
  pause between beeps.

  25 cents - 5 beeps, each 33 milliseconds duration with a 33 millisecond
  pause between beeps.

  Two methods have commonly been used by phone phreaks to produce these
  tones and make free calls.

  1. The traditional Red Box consisting of a pair of Wien-bridge oscillators
  with the timing controlled by 555 timer chips.

  2. Producing the signals with a computer which are recorded and then
  played back into the mouth piece of a pay phone.

  A third method has recently appeared which is a real mind blower. A phreak
  in the Midwest has extensively tested a method of red boxing which uses
  nothing more than a pair of brass or aluminum whistles. The whistles are
  1/4 inch in diameter by 4 inches long and are tuned by means of a wooden
  dowel rod which fits snugly inside. The whistles can be brought precisely
  on frequency by tuning them against a known signal source such as a
  computer capable of producing the tones. Once tuned, the whistles are
  glued or taped together so they can be blown together to produce the dual
  tone used in coin signaling.  It has been tested and proven that with a
  little practice these whistles can be used to make free calls. Now you can
  blow your money without spending a cent.

   Essentially,the red box is a device used to fool the phone company
into thinking you are depositing coins into a payphone.  Every time you
drop a coin into a payphone, the phone signals the type of coin inserted
with one or more bursts of a combination of 1700hz and 2200hz.  The tone
bursts are coded as follows:
Nickel:One 60 millisecond pulse
Dime  :Two 60 millisecond pulses separated by 60 milliseconds
Quarter:Five 35 millisecond pulses separated by 35 milliseconds

                         HOW TO USE IT
                         -------------

   Operation is simple.  Simply dial a long distance number (some areas
require you to stick in a genuine nickel first), wait for the ACTS
computer to demand your cash, and press the "deposit" button on the red
box for each coin you want to simulate.  The coin signals are coupled
from the red box into the phone with a small speaker held to the
mouthpiece.  For local calls, either you must first deposit a genuine
nickel before "simulating" more coins or place your call through the
operator with 0 + 7d.  Use some care when the operator is on the
line--sometimes they catch on to your beeper ploy.

                         CIRCUIT OPERATION
                         -----------------

   Each time the pushbutton is pressed, it triggers half of IC1,
configured as a monostable multivibrator to energize the rest of the
circuit for a length of time determined by the setting of the coin
selector switch.  This in turn starts the other half of IC1, configured
as an astable multivibrator, pulsing on and off at regular intervals at
a rate determined by the 50k pot between pins 12 and 13.  The output of
the astable thus alternately powers of IC2, configured as a square wave
oscillator, providing the required 1700hz and 2200hz to the op amp which
acts as a buffer to drive the speaker.

                         CONSTRUCTION
                         ------------

   Assemble the circuit as you wish.  Component placement is not
critical.  I found the easiest method was to use point-to-point wiring
on a "universal" PC grid board with solder ringed holes.  Use sockets if
you aren't a whiz with a soldering iron.  Be sure to leave easy access
to the potentiometers for alignment.

                         ALIGNMENT AND TESTING
                         ---------------------

   For alignment, a frequency counter and tiggered sweep oscilloscope
are extremely handy (but not absolutely necessary.)

   Install a temporary jumper from +9v supply to pin 14 of IC2 and
temporarily disconnect the 0.01uF capacitors from pins 5 and 9 of IC2.
Power up the circuit.  Measuring the output from pin 5 of IC2 with the
frequency counter, adjust the 20k pot between pins 1 and 6 for an output
of 1700hz.  Now adjust the 20k pot between pins 8 and 13 for an output
of 2200hz from pin 9 of IC2.  Remove the temporary jumper and re-attach
the capacitors to pins 5 and 9.  (Note: if no frequency counter is
available, the outputs can be adjusted by ear one at a time by
zero-beating the output tone with a computer generated tone of known
precision.)

   Next, temporarily disconnect the wire between pins 5 and 10 of IC1.
Set coin selector switch in the "N" (nickel) position.  With the
oscilloscope measuring the output from pin 9 of IC1, adjust the 50k pot
between pins 12 and 13 of IC1 for output pulses of 60 millisecond
duration.  Reconnect the wire between pins 5 and 10.  (Note: If no scope
is available, adjust the pulse rate by ear using computer generated
tones for comparison.)

   The remaining adjustments are made by ear.

   Leave the selector switch in the "N" position.  Adjust the 50k pot
labelled "Dime" for a quick double beep each time the pushbutton is
pressed.

   Finally, set the selector to "Quarter".  Adjust the 50k pot labelled
"Quarter" until exactly 5 very quick beeps are heard for each button
press.  Don't worry if the quarter beeps sound shorter and faster than
the nickel and dime ones.  They should be.

                         CONCLUSION
                         ----------

   If all went well to this point, your red box should be completely
aligned and functional.  A final test should now be conducted from a
payphone using the DATL (dial access test line) coin test.  Dial
09591230 and follow the computer instructions using the red box at the
proper prompts.  The computer should correctly identify all coins
"simulated" and flag any anomalies.  With a little discretion, your red
box should bring you many years of use.  Remember, there's no such thing
as spare change.!

I bought the guts to a hallmark card at 3 pm yesterday, before 5 I had a 
working box... Heres the instructions for the complete idiot (or those 
just having trouble)

Materials:
---------
1 Hallmark digital recording card (~$8, card store)
1 1/8 inch mono phono plug (~$1 or in a junk bin)
1 SPST switch, or momentary contact NORMALLY OPEN (~$1 or junk bin)
The QUARTER.VOC File (and access to a sound card to play it, and software 
  that lets you loop it) *THIS FILE IS UUENCODED AT THE END OF THIS TEXT*
1 case of some sort (I used a case from a DAT, but anything you can put 
  the stuff in will work.  Perhaps the case from a Data Tape or a 8mm Video 
  tape, or just a casette)
1 Tube of silicone sealant (epoxy will probably do, I just happened to 
  have silicone on hand)


What to do:
----------

1. Remove all components from the plastic thing inside the card, this 
includes sliding the battry pack out of it's drawer.

2. Cut the following wires:

   Both wires going to microphone (both are green, mark which one goes to 
    the center of the mike)
   Both wires to the battery pack (red and white)
   Both wires to the switch mechanisim (green and black)

2a. (OPTIONAL) It is a wise idea (if you are fairly experienced at 
soldering/desoldering on small PC boards) to desolder all the wires and 
replace them with ones of a thicker gauge.  THe ones that hallmark 
supplies are just too damn thin and have a real tendancy to break at 
connections.  REMEMBER, the wires in this card are supposed to be 
protected in the little plastic grooves that you removed them from.  

3. Discard the switch mechanisim.

4. Wrap the battery pack in electrical tape (I used red tape just to be
    cheesy, since the box is clear)

5. Solder the SPST switch to the black and green wires that used to go to 
    theo original switch (polarity is NOT important)

6. Solder the phono plug to the 2 green wires.  Polarity shouldn't really 
  be important, but to be on the safe side, the wire that ran to the center 
  of the mike (I told you to mark it) should go to the TIP of the plug.

7. Connect the battery. (This battery pack puts out 6.25VDC, I suppose 
you could replace it with another battery, but why bother?)  POLARITY IS 
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!.  The red wire goes to the Positive terminal, and 
the white goes to the negative.  On my box, if the pack is laying flat, 
with the exposed part of the batteries pointing up, the positive terminal 
is the one on the left (if you are facing the terminals)  I'd use a 
multimeter just to be sure.

8. Glue the pc board to the top of the battery (this saves space and 
hassle later, but is not necessary for operation)

9. Program the thing...
  
   I used the QUARTER.VOC file (sorry, i don't have a copy of it in any other
   format) and I looped it 10 times, with a random delay of between .5 
   and 1 seconds between each quarter (who puts them in at regular intervals 
   anyway?)
   
   Plug the phono plug into your soundcard, turn the volume Waaaaaaay 
   down (trial and error will give you the proper volume) and play the 
   voc file (after setting the switch on the pc board to the record 
   position, and flipping the SPST at the beginning of the VOC file)

10. Test it...

   Best way to test is to call a long distance Directory Assistance (Im 
partial to 808-555-1212 which is Hawaii)

If it doesn't work, go back to step 9.  The ideal volume is one that can 
be heard clearly, but does not cause the speaker to break up.

11. Once you have the thing programmed, there is no need to keep the 
phono plug attatched.  If you want to save room, cut it off.

12. Put the thing in the case.  Drill several holes in the case where the 
speaker will mount.  I mounted the speaker with silicone very carefully 
applied to the edges of the speaker.  Same was true of the battery pack.  
The switch obviously mounts in a hole on the side of the case.

Thats it...

Comments/Questions:

Why the SPST Switch?

 First off, I thought the switch that came with the thing looked really 
cheaply made, and would probably break.  Secondly, bu putting in a switch 
instead of a momentary switch, it allows me to record $2.50 on the box, 
and play the whole thing back just by flipping the switch, rather than 
having to hold it down.

There you have it. the Under $10 red-box.
