<h2>Redbox: the Radio Shack Dialer Modification</h2>
So you've heard about the redbox and you'd like to know more about how they are built.
Here's how:
Go out and buy a Radio Shack memory dialer - Part #43-146.<br>
The device looks like this:<img align=top src="dialer2.jpg" width=100 height=150><br>

<img align=right src="dialer1a.gif" width=270 height=233>
Click <a href="dialer1.jpg">here</a> for a more detailed shot. A crystal around 6.5 MHz is required.
A 6.5536 MHz is more widely used and can be used as a replacement but will not work in some areas.
To modify the device, cut or desolder the existing crystal (it is shown as the small cylindrical
object at the bottom of the picture) and resolder the new crystal in its place. The new crystal is
the ovular object to the right of the black blob. The crystals come in many different shapes and sizes.
The best one that we've found for the operation is from Digi-Key (1-800-344-4539)
part number <b>x415-nd</b>.  The tricky part is placing the crystal in a
location that will permit the case to close properly.<br>
The * button will now produce a sound similar to the coin tone. For added convenience, program the three
programmable buttons with a single tone (nickel), two *'s (dime), and 5 *'s (quarter).<br>
