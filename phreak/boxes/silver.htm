Silver Box
--------------------

Tools and materials :  Soldering Iron, Solder, Some 22 ga.wire, a SPDT switch,
and a screwdriver.

1) Unscrew your phone (must be a touch tone, desk type)
2) Remove the mounted pad and take the clear plastic cover from the bottom.
3) Hold the pad with the numbers 0, *, # facing you, and turn it upside down, 
   so you can see the yellow pc board.
4) You should see 2 black round doughnuts.
5) Position the board so the solder points for the left doughnut face you.
6) Count over four points from the left, and attach a (green) wire to that
   point.
7) Between you and the doughnuts, there should be 2 long yellow capacitors.  To 
   the right of these, and on the edge of the board there should be 3 gold 
   contacts. We will use the one on the left.
8) The contact originally is spot welded, so snip it open.
9) To the one nearest you, attach a (red) wire to the other one, a (yellow)
   wire.
10) Run the wires out of the phone, and solder the switch.
11) The orientation should be (red) to center. The switch will now alternate 
    between normal and 1633hz fourth column tones.


                        Silver Box Documentation

The silver box transforms keys 3,6,9,# to A,B,C,D.  

Those tones stand for:

A - Flash
B - Flash override (priority)
C - Priority communication
D - Priority overide (top military)

        Those keys only work on certain networks.  Now what do you do with  
those extratones?  Call any long distance directory by dialing (area code)
555-1212 and while it rings press the # key then as the operator answers you 
will disconnect them instantly and hear a pulsing tone, press 6 (normal tone
and it will stop.  Then, if another person does the same thing on another
line and then presses 7 you should have a voice link.  414 A/C is good for one
that.  You can screw around with the tones and see what you get.

ATTENTION:
  BE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO SOLDER!  THIS
COULD PERMENANTLY DAMAGE YOUR PHONE!!!
READ EVERYTHING BEFORE DOING ANYTHING!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Ingreadients:
     1    Blue wire about 1 foot.
     1    Gray wire about 1 foot.
     1    Brown wire about 1 foot.
          (Better to overkill....)
     1    Single pole/Double throw
          (SPDT) switch. (Smallest
          you can find.)
     1    Standard bell phone.

Tools:
     1    Soldering Iron and Solder.
     1    flat-tip screwdriver.
     1    Very patcient person.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
1:   Take the casing off your phone by
     loosening the two screws
     underneath it.  (Don't take the
     screws all the way off!)
2:   Loosen (But don't remove) the
     screws on the side of the touch-
     tone keypad. (The ones that attach
     it to the mounting bracket.) and
     CAREFULLY remove the keypad from
     the mounting bracket.
3:   You will notice a plastic cover on
     the keypad; seperate the two
     halves and get the out of your
     way. (Don't destroy them, you will
     need them later.)
4:   Now, look at the top of the pad
     (so the 123 row is facing away,
     and the *0# row is toward you.
     Turn over the keypad. You should
     see a mass of wires, gold plated
     contacts, discrete components, and
     two large doughnut shaped black
     thingies. (These are the coils hat
     make the touch-tone frequencies.
     All you are going to do is connect
     the wires that Ma Bell "Forgot"
     to.)
5:   Look at the coil on the left (with
     5 solder contacts facing you,
     rather than being perpendicular to
     you.) Count over 4 contacts FROM
     the left (or 2 conacts FROM the
     right) and solder the GRAY wire to
     the fourth post FROM the left.
6:   Solder the other end of the GRAY
     wire to the LEFT pole of the SPDT
     switch.
7:   (The point of no return)..........
     Take a look at the bottom edge of
     the keypad. You should see a row
     of three gold plated contacts (to
     the right of two very large
     capasitors) look at the one on the
     left and GENTELY seperate the two
     touching connectors (They are
     soldered together with a drop of
     solder) and spread them apart.
8:   Solder the brown wire to the top
     contact (The one futhest from
     you), and solder it to the RIGHT
     pole of SPDT switch.
9:   Now, take the blue wire and solder
     it to the bottom (Closest)
     contact.  Solder the other end of
     this wire to the CENTER pole of
     SPDT switch.
***************************************
                 DONE
***************************************
10:  Now put you phone back together.
     (To make it look professonal, make
     a hole in the plastic top of your
     phone and stick the SPDT switch
     through it.
  Now, (Hopefully) when the switch is
in on position you will have a normal
phone and when it is in the other
position the 3, 6, 9, and # keys (Which
are now the A, B, C, and D keys) will
magically produce the SILVER BOX TONES!

--------------------

  First off, a silver box adds the
four extra tones to your phone that
Ma Bell never told you about. They go
like this:

               1  2  3  A
               4  5  6  B
               7  8  9  C
               *  0  #  D

  There used to be many places were
you could use SILVER BOX tones, but
now you can only use it in places were
Ma Bell hasn't gotten around to
replacing here old switchboxes,
(4A), or on Autovan.
  Autovan is a special military phone
line, like a mass of private lines
hooked together (I think, but I'm not
sure).
  To see if a specific area has the
old 4A switchboxes try this test:
  Call up there directory assistance by
using XXX-555-1212, (Where XXX is
the area code you are check out. Now
hold down the "D" key as soon as you
finish dialing. (If you are using the
SILVER BOX that I showed you how to
make; Switch to SILVER BOX tones
and hold down the "#" key.) The phone
should start ringing and the operator
will answer.
  If the operator screams at you to
stop pressing your keypad, then hang
up and try a diffrent areacode. (This
one does not work.)
  If you get a pulsing tone the you got
a good line! Now try out different
numbers. 6 and 7 usually form a loop
line and two people with SILVER
BOXES can talk. But some of these
are whatched, so DON'T say anything
you wouldn't want your mother to
hear!
  I have heard the 213 works but is
being watched. Try out of the way
states like Iowa, Monatana, Wyoming,
ect...

  This will tell you how to make a
portable silver box out of:

       A Radio Shack touch tone pad
       Some wire
       A Soldering iron
       And a SPDT switch

NOTE: You should have an I.Q. above
room tempature before attempting this.
Also, read all of this article before
starting.

WARNING: This may be hazardous to your
freedom.

1} Take off the plastic cover that
stores the batteries and remove the
screw that is in the center of the
batteries. Now use a screw driver to
pry open the box.

2} Now you should have the two halves
in your hands. On the side that has the
circuit board, it should be held by two
clips. Remove the circuit board now.

3} You should now be able to see the
back side of the keypad. Connecting the
the key pad and the circuit board is a
ribben cable. With the ribben ends
connected to the keypad away from you,
count from the left over four wires.
On the fourth wire, take and cut the
plastic on either side on the wire.
Then desolder it.

4} Now stare at the circuit board. Look
at the connections of the chip.
(SEE FIG.) There should be four pins
not connected to anything. On the
ninth pin (first row, first pin) solder
a 3 inch wire to it. The other end goes
to the left side of the spdt switch.

5} Go back to the cable. Solder a 2
inch to the ribben cable you just took
out. This is because it won't reach the
switch. The other end goes to right
side of the switch.

6} Now take a two inch wire and solder
it to the hole that the cable came out
of. Becareful not to get solder on the
other wires. Now take the other end and
solder it to the middle of the switch.

7} Make a hole in the top of the case
to put the switch through. And put it
back together.

THE FIGURE!!
OF THE CHIP.

THE PIN >9< 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

         1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

(Pretty cool eh?)

_______________________________________

Switch the switch left according to the
way you soldered it to make silver box
tones on the 3,6,9, and # keys.
Switch it to the right for a normal key
pad.
Switching it to the middle does
NOTHING!!!!

This silver is small enough to fit in
your pocket for phreaking at your
nearest pay phone or where ever.
