     If there are two pay phones next to each other, you can call
long distance on one and put the coins in the other. When the
operator cuts in and asks you to deposit money, drop the coins in
the one you are not using, but hold the reciever up to the slots
so the operator can hear the bells ring. When you've finished,
you can simply press the return button on the phone with the
coins, and you'll get them back. (Or tape record the sounds etc)
{For this, nowadays, put the reciver up to the earpiece on the
other phone and procede as above stated.}
