  This article will tell you how to change a normal touch tone
  keypad and convert it to a portable unit. In addition, we
  give the touch-tone frequencies.

  First of all, the tones made by a touch tone telephone are not
  single tones, they are a combination of two tones, making "DTMF"
  (dual tone multi-frequency). The normal tone telephone dials 12
  different signals, but is capable of dialing 16 different signals
  (see bulletin on silver boxes).

  The power required by a keypad is about 25 volts, but they will
  work with as little as 15, thereby allowing the use of two 9-
  volt radio batteries.  As you may have guessed, they are also
  designed to operate with a telephone type speaker (and phone
  line), and not the standard 8-ohm speaker which needs to be used
  for adequate volume.  To accompolish this, we use a matching
  transformer, this is one of those miniature ones available at
  Radio Shack.  Enough of the theory, now for the circuit.

  You will need:

  A touch tone keypad
  A miniature 1000 to 8 ohm transformer (Radio Shack # 273-1380)
  A standard 8-ohm speaker
  Two 9-volt radio batteries
  Two 9-volt battery clips
  A case to put it all in (optional)

  A few construction notes, I suggest that you solder and tape all
  connections.  It is also important to read this entire bulletin
  before attempting to construct this.

  First, connect the RED wire of the transformer to either
  terminal on the speaker.  Now connect the WHITE wire from the
  transformer to the other terminal on the speaker.  Next, connect
  the RED (positive) wire of one battery clip to the black wire of
  the other battery clip.  Now connect the the remaining RED wire
  on the second battery clip to the GREEN wire from the touch tone
  pad.  Connect the BLUE wire from the touch tone pad to the
  ORANGE-and-BLACK striped wire from the touch tone pad.  To these
  two wires, now connect the remaining black lead from first
  battery clip.  You have now finished the power connection to the
  keypad.  Connect the BLACK wire from the keypad to the BLUE wire
  on the transformer.  Next connect the RED-and-GREEN striped wire
  from the keypad to the GREEN wire on the transformer.  The BLACK
  wire on the transformer should not be connected to anything,
  along with quite a few wires from the keypad.  The connection of
  the keypad is now complete.  All you have to do is connect two
  nine volt batteries to the battery clips, and you'll be ready to
  go. You may want to mount it in a case for easy portability.
  Note that the silver box modification CAN be made to this unit,
  allowing complete remote phreaking.  When none of the buttons
  are pressed, this unit uses NO power, thereby eliminating the
  need for a power switch, and extending the life of the
  batteries.

  The following are the frequency combinations generated by each
  button on the keypad.

            To bring the White Box to its full potential Silver box

THIS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU HOW TO
CHANGE A NORMAL TOUCH TONE KEYPAD AND
CONVERT IT TO A PORTABLE UNIT. IN
ADDITION, WE GIVE THE TOUCH-TONE
FREQUENCIES.

FIRST OF ALL, THE TONES MADE BY A
TOUCH TONE TELEPHONE ARE NOT SINGLE
TONES, THEY ARE A COMBINATION OF TWO
TONES, MAKING "DTMF" (DUAL TONE
MULTI-FREQUENCY). THE NORMAL TONE
TELEPHONE DIALS 12 DIFFERENT SIGNALS,
BUT IS CAPABLE OF DIALING 16 DIFFERENT
SIGNALS (SEE BULLETIN ON SILVER).

THE POWER REQUIRED BY A KEYPAD IS
ABOUT 25 VOLTS, BUT THEY WILL WORK
WITH AS LITTLE AS 15, THEREBY ALLOWING
THE USE OF TWO 9- VOLT RADIO
BATTERIES.  AS YOU MAY HAVE GUESSED,
THEY ARE ALSO DESIGNED TO OPERATE WITH
A TELEPHONE TYPE SPEAKER (AND PHONE
LINE), AND NOT THE STANDARD 8-OHM
SPEAKER WHICH NEEDS TO BE USED FOR
ADEQUATE VOLUME.  TO ACCOMPOLISH THIS,
WE USE A MATCHING TRANSFORMER, THIS IS
ONE OF THOSE MINIATURE ONES AVAILABLE
AT RADIO SHACK.  ENOUGH OF THE THEORY,
NOW FOR THE CIRCUIT.

YOU WILL NEED:

TONE KEYPAD
A MINIATURE 1000 TO 8 OHM
   TRANSFORMER (RADIO SHACK # 273-1380)
A STANDARD 8-OHM SPEAKER
TWO 9-VOLT RADIO BATTERIES
TWO 9-VOLT BATTERY CLIPS
A CASE TO PUT IT ALL IN (OPTIONAL)

A FEW CONSTRUCTION NOTES, I SUGGEST
THAT YOU SOLDER AND TAPE ALL
CONNECTIONS.  IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO
READ THIS ENTIRE BULLETIN BEFORE
ATTEMPTING TO CONSTRUCT THIS.

FIRST, CONNECT THE RED WIRE OF THE
TRANSFORMER TO EITHER TERMINAL ON THE
SPEAKER.  NOW CONNECT THE WHITE WIRE
FROM THE TRANSFORMER TO THE OTHER
TERMINAL ON THE SPEAKER.  NEXT,
CONNECT THE RED (POSITIVE) WIRE OF ONE
CLIP TO THE BLACK WIRE OF THE
OTHER BATTERY CLIP.  NOW CONNECT THE
THE REMAINING RED WIRE ON THE SECOND
BATTERY CLIP TO THE GREEN WIRE FROM
THE TOUCH TONE PAD.  CONNECT THE BLUE
WIRE FROM THE TOUCH TONE PAD TO THE
ORANGE-AND-BLACK STRIPED WIRE FROM THE
TOUCH TONE PAD.  TO THESE TWO WIRES,
NOW CONNECT THE REMAINING BLACK LEAD
FROM FIRST BATTERY CLIP.  YOU HAVE NOW
FINISHED THE POWER CONNECTION TO THE
KEYPAD.  CONNECT THE BLACK WIRE FROM
THE KEYPAD TO THE BLUE WIRE ON THE
TRANSFORMER.  NEXT CONNECT THE
RED-AND-GREEN STRIPED WIRE FROM THE
KEYPAD TO THE GREEN WIRE ON THE
TRANSFORMER.  THE BLACK WIRE ON THE
TRANSFORMER SHOULD NOT BE CONNECTED TO
ANYTHING, ALONG WITH QUITE A FEW WIRES
FROM THE KEYPAD.  THE CONNECTION OF
KEYPAD IS NOW COMPLETE.  ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS CONNECT TWO NINE VOLT
BATTERIES TO THE BATTERY CLIPS, AND
YOU'LL BE READY TO GO. YOU MAY WANT TO
MOUNT IT IN A CASE FOR EASY
PORTABILITY. NOTE THAT THE SILVER BOX
MODIFICATION CAN BE MADE TO THIS UNIT,
ALLOWING COMPLETE REMOTE PHREAKING. 
WHEN NONE OF THE BUTTONS ARE PRESSED,
THIS UNIT USES NO POWER, THEREBY
ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR A POWER
SWITCH, AND EXTENDING THE LIFE OF THE
BATTERIES.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE FREQUENCY
COMBINATIONS GENERATED BY EACH BUTTON
ON THE
KEYPAD.
