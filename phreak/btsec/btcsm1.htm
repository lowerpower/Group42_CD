<H4>1.1 Introduction</H4>

British Telecom (BT) is highly reliant on electronic systems to support its
business processes. Computers are used in many critical points in the business: in
switching systems, administration systems and management systems. Many of
these systems are either interconnected, or are planned to be interconnected,
BT's infrastructure of systems will become highly integrated.<P>

This evolutionary process makes security even more important. It is becoming
possible to access a wide variety of information from a single terminal.
Furthermore, a security flaw or failure in one system may allow unauthorised
access or misuse of other systems.<P>

BT possesses valuable information about its customers and their commercial
operations which it is our responsibility to safeguard. Coupled with this should be
an awareness of the possibility of computer crime by people inside and outside BT.<P>

While security failures are, like any other quality failure, bad business practice,
the repercussions may be more serious.<P>

There are many motivators for good electronic security. BT is obliged under the
terms of its current licence to observe a Code of Practice on disclosure of
customer information. Disclosure of information could also provide likely
movements in the price of BT shares or those of our suppliers. It could be used to
embarrass the business by disclosure of commercial negotiations. The business
could also suffer through corruption or loss of data. There could also be personal
legal liability under the terms of the Data Protection Act in the event of security
failure. All these possibilities make the security of BT computer operations
increasingly important.<P>

Good security does not have to be expensive. Often simple, low-cost measures,
combined with a positive attitude to security, can achieve considerable reduction
in the vulnerability of BT systems.<P>

<H4>1.2 Scope and purpose</H4><P>

Although this manual is called the Computer Secunty Manual, it encompasses all
electronic systems that are broadly computer-based. It applies equally, for
example, to digital switching systems and building access control systems, as well
as to the mainframe and personal computers for which it has customarily been
used.<P>

BT is now operating in a global environment and its activities cover most parts of
the world. Many of its non-core activities and overseas operations are carried out
through subsidiary companies. All people working in these wholly-owned
subsidiaries are also "BT people". "BT" refers to the parent company and all its
wholly owned subsidiaries. Adoption of the CSM in partly-owned subsidiaries will
be a matter negotiated between the Director of Security and Investigation and the
senior management of each part-owned subsidiary.<P>

The purpose of the Computer Secunty Manual is to enable BT people to recognise
possible threats to BT s systems, and to bring together the current guidance on
e!ectronic security principles and practices which may be used to minimise the
risk.<P>

<H6>Examples of threats include:</H6><P>
<UL>
<LI>natural calamities such as fire or flood
<LI>sophisticated tampering
<LI>software errors
<LI>hardware failure
<LI>vulnerability of communication links
<LI>anauthorised use of terminals
<LI>hacking
<LI>deliberate damage, and
<LI>fraud.
</UL><P>
The Computer Security Manual is primarily intended for those who specify
security requirements in BTs systems and those who implement them, it is also
essential reading for users of those systems so that they may understand the
rationale behind the protective measures that may be imposed upon them.
While it is recognised that the threats to BT's systems are constantly changing,
the guidance given is the best available at the time of issue. It should be
recognised however, that guidance will need to be revised when existing threats
change or new threats appear.<P>

<H4>1.3 Relationship to the previous issue</H4><P>

Although some of the policies on electronic systems security affecting computers
have changed since the last issue, the previous structure has been retained where
possible, so as to cause minimum inconvenience to users of the manual.<P>

<H4>1.4 Structure of the manual</H4><P>

This version of the Computer Security Manual contains mandatory requirements,
called CSM Policies, which should be followed in the design, implementation and
operation of systems.<P>

The CSM Policies describe various mechanisms that can be employed to protect
the security of an electronic system, and are derived from threats (that have been
found) and countermeasures that can be used.<P>

The main text provides guidance and background to the CSM Policy statements.<P>

The chapters have been ordered to reflect the larger view of systems (networked
systems and the supporting network infrastructure), and then narrowing that view
to large computer systems, personal computers, and so on.<P>

The page number found at the bottom of each page is in the format chapter-page
in chapter and facilitates the easy replacement of entire chapters without upsetting
the numbering of pages in subsequent chapters.<P>

<H4>1.5 Feedback</H4><P>

The policy and guidance contained in e Computer Security Manual is prepared
and issued after extensive discussion with experts in electronic security
throughout the business. The Electronic Security Unit welcomes feedback from
users on the adequacy of the guidance given, so that future issues may be
improved.<P>

<H4>1.6 Use of the CSM by suppliers and contractors</H4><P>

The CSM is the baseline document for the protection of BT's electronic assets on
BT premises, in transit, at employees' homes or on contractors' premises. Where a
supplier or contractor has obligations to protect BT assets, a copy of the CSM may
be loaned to supply the necessary guidance provided:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Agreement is obtained from DSecI

<LI>A non-disclosure agreement is in place with the supplier or contractor based on
the "Acceptance Agreement from BT"' contained within the Information Security
Code

<LI>Sections 10 and 11 are removed from the manual before it is lent to anyone outside
BT.

<LI>The manual is returned to BT upon completion or termination of the contract.<P>

</OL>
Updates to the CSM will be sent to the manager who originally arranged the loan,
who must ensure that the update arrangements meet criteria 3 and 4 above. The
CSM must be returned on completion of termination of the contract.<P>

<H4>1.7 Acknowledgements</H4><P>

We would like to thank the help received by all parts of the BT Group in the
production of this version of the Manual. In particular, Group Security, Group
Information Services, British Telecom International, British Telecom Security
Consultancy, Business Communications, Development and Procurement, Internal
Audit, and to others for their feedback to this, and previous issues of the Manual.<P>
