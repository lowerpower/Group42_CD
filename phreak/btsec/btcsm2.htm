<H4>2.1 Introduction</H4><P>

This chapter describes the objectives of the Computer Security Manual, and places
electronic security in the context of the security infrastructure for BT s business
operations and processes.<P>

<H4>2.2 Corporate policy on electronic system security</H4><P>

The electronic systems security policy for the BT Group as affirmed by Malcolm
Argent, Group Director &amp; Secretary, on 8th August 1990 is reproduced below.<P>

"The British Telecom Group attaches particular importance to the security of its
business processes and systems. The Group's policy on electronic security is to ensure
that we properly safeguard all our switching systems, information systems and other
electronic assets, having regard to legal and regulatory requirements, our
commercial interests and sound business practices.<P>

This policy covers all aspects of the electronic environment: systems; administration
procedures; environmental controls; hardware; software; data and networks. It
applies to all stages in the system life cycle, from feasibility study through to in service
and operations. It applies no matter whether the system is developed or bought by BT.
It is the responsibility of managers at all levels to observe this policy themselves and to
ensure that it is fully understood and followed by their people.<P>

To help managers carry out their responsibilities, the Director of Security and
Investigation will issue appropriate guidelines, on a continuing basis, supplementing
the requirements of the Computer Security Manual, The Information Security Code
and the Physical Security Handbook to take account of changing threats to BT's
electronic systems. He will also be the central point of information for the Company's
policy on electronic security and will monitor compliance with it. "<P>

<H4>2.3 Objective</H4><P>

The Computer Security Manual draws together the policies applying to computer
systems in particular, and electronic systems in general, supplementing it with
guidance and advice on implementation. Within the BT Group there are many
different computer systems supporting a multitude of business processes.
Therefore it is not possible to produce specific recommendations for the security
of every aspect of every system. The objective of the Manual is to concentrate on
the baseline policy and guidelines generally applicable to BT systems.<P>

<H4>2.4 Relationship to other security policies</H4><P>

The Computer Security Manual is an elaboration and extension of the information
security strategy contained in the Information Security Code.<P>

<H4>2.4.1 Application</H4><P>

Except where inapplicable, the Policies enumerated in the Computer Security
Manual are MANDATORY. For example: Passwords are not a mandatory feature
of all BT systems, but where an analysis suggests that passwords are a sufficiently
strong measure to regulate access to those systems, the relevant policies on
passwords contained in this Manual become mandatory. Policies usually appear
after any descriptive text and are numbered to assist the checking of compliance
in systems.<P>

While Policies are mandatory, all supporting guidance and advice on
implementing the policies is discretionary, although strongly recommended to
achieve a harmonious and consistent approach to electronic security throughout
the BT Group. Policies appear within boxes.<P>

<H5>POLICY 2.1: ASSIMILATION OF REVISED MANDATORY POLICY</H5><P>

From the date of publication, this issue of the Computer Security Manual
applies to all new systems supporting BT's business operations and processes.
It also applies to any changes to existing systems, in particular where an
opportunity to update security occurs, so as to achieve greater compliance with
the policies given in this manual.<P>

<H4>2.5 Responsibility for security</H4><P>

Every BT employee, and those contracted to work for BT have the responsibility
to ensure the security of BT assets. Where the asset is information, the degree of
protection needed is defined by the owner of the information. Additional measures
may be required beyond those necessary to protect BT's information assets
because of legal requirements.<P>

<H4>2.5.1 Business operation or process owner</H4><P>

It is the responsibility of the owner of each business operation or process to
recognise the value of their activity, and the potential impact on the business from
security failure. In the context of the Computer Security Manual, ownership of a
process is defined as the manager responsible or accountable for the process.<P>

The responsibility of the business operation or process owner also extends to
ensuring that, in general terms, security of the systems supporting the process is
adequate in relationship to the impact of security failure. A service level agreement
should exist between the business process and the system owners.<P>

<H5>POLICY 2.2: RESPONSIBILITY ASSIGNED TO PROCESS OWNERS</H5><P>

The owner of each business process shall ensure that security is adequate in
the systems that support the process.<P>

<H4>2.5.2 System supplier</H4><P>

The process owner will be responsible for evaluating the impact of security failure
and deciding on the general requirements for security. The detailed
implementation of security controls and countermeasures to meet the owner's
requirements will be the responsibility of the system supplier whose computer
systems support the process. The process owner and the computer supplier will
usually be linked through a customer/supplier relationship. The quality of
computer security, including the adherence to the policies described in this
Manual should be the subject of a Service Level Agreement.<P>

<H4>2.6 Derivation of security requirements</H4><P>

<H4>2.6.1 Value and impact analysis</H4><P>

The security measures needed to safeguard each business process will be
determined from the sensitivity of the material handled and the impact of security
failure, defined in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. The owner of
each business operation or process will ensure that the value of the information
processed and the impact of security failure are known since they are the core
parameters in the rationale of cost-effective security. Sometimes the value of the
information may be obvious and easily quantified as a monetary expression. On
other occasions, the value of the information or processing capability is less
apparent, protection being necessary to safeguard only the reputation or
credibility of the Business.<P>

Impact of failure includes the concepts of asset value, importance, damage to the
business because of information disclosure, loss of accuracy or currency of the
information, and loss of the use of business-critical resources.<P>

<H4>2.6.2 Data sensitivity</H4><P>

The Information Security Code describes the privacy marking to be used to
identify information which requires a level of protection beyond that provided by a
clear desk policy. Currently this protection is defined only in terms of the
confidentiality requirements of security. There is no comparable marking for
integrity or availability.<P>

Information stored using electronic media is more vulnerable when stored than
information on paper . It can be easily modified without trace, and its content is
not immediately obvious. It is readily deleted, and in large systems can be easily
lost. Therefore the sensitivity of electronic data should be specified in terms of the
impact of loss arising from failure of confidentiality, integrity or availability.<P>

To preserve compatibility with the paper-based system, data sensitivities for
electronic information use the same criteria for assessing the impact of security
failure, thus allowing common threat models to be used.<P>

<H4>2.6.2.1 Sensitivity level 1</H4><P>

Information for which the impact of inaccuracy, alteration, disclosure or
unavailability would be to cause inconvenience or reduction in operational
efficiency.<P>

<H4>2.6.2.2 Sensitivity level 2</H4><P>
Information for which the impact of inaccuracy, alteration, disclosure or
unavailability would be to cause any of the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Significant financial loss to BT;

<LI>Significant gain to a competitor;

<LI>Marked embarrassment to BT;

<LI>Marked loss of confidence to BT and its commercial dealing;

<LI>Marked reduction of BT's standing in the community or to relationships generally.
Information marked IN CONFIDENCE has sensitivity level 2.<P>
</UL>
<H4>2.6.2.3 Sensitivity 1evel 3</H4><P>
Information for which the impact of inaccuracy, alteration, disclosure or
unavailability would be to cause any of the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Substantial financial loss to BT;

<LI>Substantial gain to a competitor;

<LI>Severe embarrassment to BT;

<LI>Serious loss of confidence in BT;

<LI>Serious reduction of BT's standing in the community or to relationships generally.
Information marked IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE has sensitivity level 3 and are
called in this manual High Impact Systems.<P>
</UL>
<H4>2.6.2.4 Sensitivity levels above 3</H4><P>
Impact scenarios exist for failures of security for data beyond sensitivity level 3.
Specialist advice is available from the Director of Security and Investigation on
electronic systems which process: corporate plans; business propositions (new
enterprises, flotations, joint ventures, take-overs); personnel and industrial
relations matters; marketing strategies and plans; financial and tariff proposals,
and high-level contractual matters, or other information which is price-sensitive
within the terms of the Stock Exchange Listing Agreement.<P>

<H4>POLICY2.3: VALUE OF ASSETS AND IMPACT OF FAILURE</H4><P>

The value of the information, assets or processing capability to be protected
shall be estimated and recorded, as shall the impact of possible disclosure,
inaccuracy, incompleteness or unavailability of that information.<P>

<H4>2.6.3 Countermeasures</H4><P>
A fundamental objective is to ensure that the countermeasures deployed to protect
sensitive information or processes should be practical and appropriate to the
threats against the electronic systems, giving due regard to the impact of security
failure.<P>

While insufficient, inappropriate, or poorly implemented countermeasures may
leave a system unduly vulnerable, excessive countermeasures may lead to
complacency, the neglect of security operating procedures, and an unjustifiably
high overhead of processing power, or severe operational difficulties.<P>

<H4>POLICY 2.4: COUNTERMEASURES</H4><P>

The cost of countermeasures should be appropriate to the threats to security
and business processes, the value of the information being protected and the
impact of any security failure.<P>

<H4>2.6.4 Risk analysis</H4><P>

It is the responsibility of the owner of each business operation or process to
assess and manage effectively the degree of risk to commercially sensitive
information, and the resilience of critical business processes supported by
computer-based systems. The risk analysis will take cognisance of the value of the
information or critical processes being protected, and the perceived threats to the
system. Furthermore, the risk analysis should not be a once-only exercise. It
should be repeated regularly and revalidated whenever significant changes occur
to the security assumptions.<P>

<H4>POLICY2.5: RISK ANALYSIS</H4><P>

At all principal stages during the life cycle of each project involving the storage
or processing of commercially sensitive information, or the provision of High
Impact Systems, a risk analysis shall be undertaken. The analysis, which must
be repeated periodically or revalidated to assess the impact of change, must be
so as to determine the vulnerability of the commercially sensitive information
or applications in its processing environment, given the prevailing threats to
security, the countermeasures deployed, and the value of the information being
processed.<P>

<H4>2.7 Security policy for the life cycle</H4><P>

The preparation of a Security Policy Document (Security Statement) should be
viewed as an integral part of the life-cycle of business processes. At the beginning
of each project a security policy will be prepared to guide the implementation of
security in the systems that will support the business operation. This vital step is
necessary to ensure that correct business planning decisions are taken. Where
security is a relevant feature of a process, its provision will be costed and included
in business cases going forward for financial approval.<P>

<H4>POLICY 2.6: SECURITY POLICY DOCUMENT</H4><P>

A Security Policy Document will be prepared by the owner of a business
process, outlining the system, the impact or loss associated with possible
security failure, the threats to the system, the proposed countermeasures, and a
risk analysis. The Security Policy Document will guide development and
implementation of security features during the development life- cycle of the
system that supports the business process, of which electronic security is an
integral part. A Security Policy Document is also required for existing systems
where the impact of security failure is high.<P>

Details of all BT multi-user, administration and management systems must be
registered by the Development Manager on the Applications Inventory. This is the
catalogue of the company's software assets, and is used to inform People of what
systems exist and assist management of the portfolio. The requirement to register
covers systems that are either developed or procured by BT. Details may be found
in section 10.<P>

<H4>2.8 Security evaluation, certification and accreditation</H4><P>

The accreditation life cycle is a process for checking that appropriate security is
built into the specification, development and operational procedures for systems,
thereby ensuring that the security requirements of the business are met prior to
the system becoming operational.<P>

Security accreditation for electronic systems has three main objectives:<P>
<UL>
<LI>to ensure that the level of security in BT's High Impact Systems is adequate;
<LI>to prevent systems without adequate security being deployed until remedial
action has been undertaken; and
<LI>to provide a framework for the continued improvement of the quality of security
in BT's systems.<P>
</UL>
<H4>2.8.1 Scope of accreditation</H4><P>

System security accreditation is a process which is undertaken to ensure that
security mechanisms, procedures and functions have been implemented in a way
that guarantees a level of confidence in the quality of the system security.<P>

The BT scheme, which is broadly based upon the 'Information Technology
Security Evaluation Criteria' (lTSEC), is facilitated through agents operating on
behalf of the Director of Security and Investigation.<P>

<H4>2.8.2 Four-stage approach to security accreditation</H4><P>

The object of Security Accreditation is to reduce the risk of security failure without
unduly delaying the implementation of important systems. To assist in meeting
this objective a four-stage accreditation process has been developed.<P>

<H4>2.8.2.1 Stage 1 - Security Policy Document (Creation and Approval)</H4><P>

The Security Policy Document (SPD) outlines the system, the impact or loss
associated with possible security failure, the threats to the system and the generic
countermeasures. The SPD will also contain a risk analysis and an assurance
rating to be used during subsequent evaluation and certification. Only high impact
systems progress into the evaluation, certification and accreditation stages. Note,
however, that all new systems must have a System Security Statement, regardless
of the need to progress into stage 2. The SPD is created by the owner of the
business process and approved by DSecI.<P>

<H4>2.8.2.2 Stage 2 - Evaluation</H4><P>

Those systems which are to be included in the accreditation process, as indicated
within the SPD and agreed by Director of Security and Investigation (DSecl), will
be evaluated to ascertain that the required level of assurance has been achieved.
The SPD is the baseline document against which the system is evaluated.<P>

DSecI will nominate an evaluator to gain and subsequently analyse information on
the following:<P>
<DL>
<DT>Requirements<DD>a detailed description of the system requirements relating to its
security.

<DT>Architectural design<DD>an examination of the system architecture.

<DT>Detailed design<DD>a more detailed description on how specific security
components have been designed.

<DT>Implementation<DD>evidence of functional and mechanism testing. Examination of
source code and hardware drawings.

<DT>Configuration control<DD>evidence of an effective change control procedure which
is able to provide unique identification of the system and details of an acceptance
procedure.

<DT>Program languages and compilers<DD>details about the language(s) used.

<DT>Developers' security<DD>security procedures including physical and personnel
arrangements.

<DT>Operational documentation<DD>examination of the user and administration
documentation provided.

<DT>Operational environment - delivery and configuration<DD>configuration information, delivery and audited
system generation procedures and evidence of an approved distribution
procedure;
<DT>Operational environment - startup and operation<DD>secure startup and operation procedures, including a
description of security functions that have a relevance during system startup.
Evidence that effective hardware diagnostic test procedures exist.
</DL>
<H4>2.8.2.3 Stage 3 - Certification</H4><P>

Certification occurs after the system has been developed. In order for certification
to be given, the evidence as described within the evaluation report(s) must show
that security has been correctly applied during the development phase.<P>

<H4>2.8.2.4 Stage 4 - Accreditation</H4><P>

Final accreditation occurs after the system has been running for a limited period of
time as agreed between DSecI and the Process Owner. The purpose of the trial is
to allow the secure operating procedures to be assessed in a live environment. The
system is then inspected in its operational environment to ascertain whether
compliance has been achieved. When a security audit indicates that this aspect of
security is satisfactory, final security accreditation can be given, after which the
system enters the normal periodic security audit cycle.<P>

<H4>POLICY 2.7: SECURITY ACCREDlTATION</H4><P>

It is the responsibility of the owner of each business process, for which the
impact of failure is high, before making operational use of the system to furnish
the Director of Security and Investigation with evidence that the security
requirements described in its Security Policy Document have been observed
during the development life cycle.<P>

<H4>2.9 Security approvals</H4><P>

Many of the policies within the Computer Security Manual require that only
products approved by the Director of Security and Investigation may be used to
protect BT commercially sensitive information and processes.<P>

SecID maintains a list of approved products. If you require a product to be
submitted through the approvals procedure it is necessary to do this via SecID.
See the contact data in Section 10.<P>

<H4>2.10 Product security</H4><P>

Developers and procurers of products for internal BT use should be aware of the
target market for the products. An assessment must be made of the likely
sensitivity of material handled by the product. Although security demands
personal responsibility from the people carrying out a particular business process,
managers should not avoid the responsibility of providing users with a secure
product environment.<P>

It is much better to design security into products rather than to add it on as an
afterthought. Substantial economies of scale can be achieved by building security
into products.<P>


<H4>POLICY 2.8: PRODUCTS FOR INTERNAL USE</H4><P>

Managers shall ensure that the security of products intended for internal BT
use meet users' needs. A clear statement shall be included with all literature
giving the sensitivity level for which the product is suitable, and the
circumstances under which it will retain its suitability.<P>
