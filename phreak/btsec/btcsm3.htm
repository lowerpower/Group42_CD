<H4>3.1 Introduction</H4>

Transmitting information between computers and other electronic based systems
can represent a substantial threat to security. Therefore safeguards appropriate to
the sensitivity of the information and the transmission medium should be adopted
during its transmission.<P>

Most of the measures described in this section are concerned only with the
protection of communication links against attack by unauthorised persons. Few of
the techniques safeguard against illicit activities by authorised users who misuse
their privilege. This section gives guidance on the acceptability of various
communications methods and services for the transfer of commercially sensitive
information. The methods recommended do not necessarily give complete
protection—absolute security is never feasible.<P>

This section addresses the issues of computer systems connected by networks,
either to other computers for exchange of information or to enable remote access
where the users of computer-based applications are remote from the service or
information provider.<P>

The advice and guidance offered herein is applicable to networks of mainframes,
personal computers and terminals or any combination of them.<P>

<H4>3.1.1 General policies</H4><P>

The following general policies apply to every case of electronic transfer of privacy
marked information.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.1: INFORMATION CORRECTLY LABELLED</H4><P>

The originator shall ensure that information to be communicated is correctly
marked in accordance with the Information Security Code.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.2: INFORMATION APPROPRIATELY PROTECTED</H4><P>

It is the responsibility of the author and originator of privacy marked or
commercially sensitive information communicated via electronic means to
ensure that it is always correctly safeguarded.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.3: INFORMATION CORRECTLY ADDRESSED</H4><P>

The originator shall ensure that IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE information is
sent only to a specific authorised recipient.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.4: TRANSMISSION OF HIGH IMPACT OR IN STRICTEST
CONFIDENCE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION</H4><P>

HIGH IMPACT or IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE information shall not be
transmitted without the protection of an encryption system approved by
Director of Security and Investigation except where one of the following is used:<P>
<OL>
<LI>private circuits for which access to all distribution frame and flexibility points
are secured for HIGH IMPACT or IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE information,
and which are routed via ducts, risers and conduits having tamper detecting
seals,

<LI> Fibre optic circuits for which all connection points are secured for HIGH
IMPACT or IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE information,

<LI> An Exclusive LAN in a secured area used only by BT People.
</OL>
<H4>POLICY 3.5: TRANSMISSION OF IN CONFIDENCE ELECTRONIC
INFORMATION</H4><P>

IN CONFIDENCE information shall not be transmitted without the protection
of approved encryption system unless communication is strongly authenticated,
such as by:<P>
<OL>
<LI>via Private Circuits between BT buildings,

<LI> via the Public Switched Telephone Network with approved dialback systems,

<LI> via the PSS using closed user groups (or equivalent), or

<LI> via the PSS with a challenge response system.
</OL>

<H4>POLICY 3.6: USE OF ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEMS</H4><P>

Privacy marked or sensitive information shall not be transmitted between
systems using Electronic Mail Systems that have not been approved as suitable
for that use by the Director of Security and Investigation.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.7: SPECIAL DISPENSATION IN AN EMERGENCY</H4><P>

Where special justification exists, for example in emergencies, IN STRICTEST
CONFIDENCE information may exceptionally be transmitted according to the
conditions for IN CONFIDENCE material. In these circumstances, prior
authority from a person in the Senior Management Group shall be obtained on
each occasion.<P>

<H4>System interconnection</H4><P>

The connection of a system of computers by means of a network forms the basis
for bilateral agreements and practices between those responsible for the security
of the computers and those responsible for the security of the network. A failure
by any of those involved to correctly secure the equipment for which they are
responsible, may result in a failure of security of the entire network.<P>

It is the responsibility of the owners of all computer systems connected to a
network to ensure that their security is not compromised by the network
techniques used, or by any subsequent changes to the network configuration and
topology. Before allowing connection of a computer system to a LAN or other
network, the owners of the business processes entrusted to that system must
satisfy themselves that their policy for security will not be violated.<P>

Connection must be refused by the computer system administrator on behalf of
the business process owner if the networking arrangements are or become
inconsistent with the security policy. These considerations apply to any network
which permits access to several computer systems via a common
telecommunications facility (whether all users need such access or not).<P>

The connection of any computer system to a network introduces a number of
additional threats to the security of that system, to the security of the network and
to any other computer system sharing the network. By far the greatest threat to a
computer connected to a network is the possibility of unauthorised access from
other network users. Other threats include the accidental or unintentional
distribution of privacy marked information across the network.<P>

The vulnerability of the network increases because the authority to grant users
permission to access the network is given to the administrator of the connected
computer system. If that computer were already connected to another network, for
example, the number of potential users might increase dramatically.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.8: CONNECTION OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM TO NETWORKS</H4><P>

The administrators of a computer system connected to networks shall ensure
that the network arrangements do not contravene the security policy of the
business processes or applications being supported by their system.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.9: INTERCONNECTION OF NETWORKS</H4><P>

Networks shall not be joined together unless it can be shown that the resulting
network does not contravene the security policy of either network or of the
security policy of those systems connected to either network.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.10: ADMINISTRATION OF A COMPUTER CONNECTED TO A
NETWORK</H4><P>

The administrators of a computer system connected to networks shall ensure
that the security administration of their system does not contravene the
security policy of the network to which their system is connected.<P>

<H4>3.3 Network management</H4><P>

Owners of systems connected to a network have a level of expectation about the
services that the network provides. For example, network users may expect that
the service:<P>
<UL>
<LI>is available when it is needed,
<LI>has sufficient capacity to carry the load,
<LI>is able to ensure the confidentiality of information in transit,
<LI>does not corrupt the information in transit,
<LI>delivers the information to the intended recipient,
<LI>restricts access to those so authorised.
</UL>
The level of service offered by the network should be well documented and will
form the basis of any contract between the owner of the network and the owners
of the connected systems.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.11: NETWORK SECURITY POLICY</H4><P>

Providers of networks that claim to provide security functions shall declare to
their users and customers the protective measures, and conditions placed on
the users of the network, for security offered by the network and shall make
available a document describing these features and their applications.<P>

<H4>3.4 Network architecture</H4><P>

The following means of computer-to-computer and user-to-computer access are
commonly encountered:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Private Circuits,
<LI>Public Switched Telephone Network,
<LI>Public data networks (PSS, for example),
<LI>Local Area Networks (of various types), and
<LI>Integrated Services Digital Network (called IDA in the UK).
</UL>
<H4>3.4.1 Private circuits</H4><P>

Private Circuits are often perceived as being secure because of their immunity to
logical attack, that is, hacking. They are not necessarily physically secure because
their fixed routing may make them vulnerable to direct interception. Typically,
Private Circuits may be routed via the distribution frame of the local exchange and
the building serving the user. Unless otherwise protected, the information on the
Private Circuit is vulnerable to interception at these points.<P>

<H4>3.4.2 Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)</H4><P>

The PSTN is open to public access and is the favoured medium for unauthorised
access world-wide. Because Calling Line Identification (CLI) is not currently
provided as a basic facility, it is not easy to identify the origin of connection
attempts. For this reason, dialup PSTN access to BT systems containing sensitive
data is forbidden unless adequate precautions are taken.<P>

The connection of computers to the PSTN for the purposes of outward-bound
connections to information service providers is strongly discouraged unless it can
be demonstrated that the connection equipment cannot be subverted or
incorrectly configured so as to permit inward-bound connections.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.12: PSTN CONNECTION TO BT SYSTEMS</H4><P>

BT computer systems containing or processing sensitive information shall not
be connected to the PSTN unless adequate precautions are taken to protect the
system from unauthorised access.<P>

<H4>3.4.3 Public data networks</H4><P>

Worldwide, there are many different data networks available to the public. The
following comments refer specifically to BT's UK data network known as PSS.<P>

In general, there are two methods by which a connection to PSS can be achieved:<P>
<UL>
<LI>by direct connection (a private circuit connecting the user to the X25 network), or

<LI>by dial connection (via the PSTN, to an X25 PAD in the network).
</UL>
Each user of PSS is identified by a Network User Address (NUA) which is
analogous to a telephone number. Where the user is directly connected to PSS,
the NUA is permanently associated with that line and can provide a valuable check
on the user's identity.<P>

If the user gains access to the PSS by dial connection to a PAD, he identifies
himself to the network by means of a password (sometimes called the Network
User Identity, NUI). This is, in turn, checked by the network management
software to find the corresponding NUA of the user. Because the NUA does not
identify a particular line or location, security may be compromised if a password is
discovered by other people.<P>

Use of the following facilities can decrease the vulnerability of the PSS to attack:<P>
<UL>
<LI>All authorised users can be included in a Closed User Group (CUG). In effect, this
creates a private network not available to unauthorised parties. However this
advantage may be compromised if the CUG includes the NUAs of dial-up users
who are authenticated only by passwords.

<LI>The caller's Network User Address (NUA) provided by PSS can be checked by
the host against a list of authorised callers.
</UL>
<H4>3.4.4 Local area netvorks</H4><P>

Access to computers and computer-to-computer communications via LANs may
present a substantial risk to security. Most LANs are implemented using a shared
transmission medium which broadcasts all the signals to most or all of the
attached nodes. Some LANs support Closed User Groups (CUGs) in a manner
analogous to the PSS and so may also provide some call origination information.
The relative ease of user access to LAN control software and hardware makes
dependence on the security of any of these facilities unwise. The situation is
especially aggravated where LANs are connected by gateways to one another, the
PSS, or to the PSTN. In each case the risk of unauthorised access is increased
enormously.<P>
See earlier CSM Policies in this section regarding the interconnection of networks.
Data on LANs are generally regarded as being at risk because:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Most LANs are designed around a shared communications facility which generally
broadcasts signals to all of the attached nodes, security being dependent on access
points ignoring messages not specifically addressed to them.

<LI>LANs are frequently used as the carriers of Office Automation facilities in the
office environment where system security was not necessarily a prime
consideration in the original choice of the accommodation.

<LI>LAN signalling sometimes extends into the radio frequency spectrum and, if
electromagnetic signals are emitted from the cabling, LAN traffic can be
intercepted (see also TEMPESI) .
</UL>
Strong methods of user authentication must be implemented if privacy marked
information is transmitted over the LAN so special precautions may need to be
applied to LANs in order to enhance their operational security. Three particular
types of LAN are defined below:<P>

<H4>3.4.4.1 Exclusive LANs</H4><P>
An Exclusive LAN is one where its security depends on:<P>
<UL>
<LI>its use being restricted to only those users who have an operational need to use it
<LI>its access points being within BT secure premises
<LI>its not being connected to another network - public or private.
</UL>
If the LAN spans several buildings, the links between those premises should be
secured by encryption.<P>

<H4>3.4.4.2 Access-controlled LANs</H4><P>

An Access-controlled LAN is one which incorporates special precautions to restrict
access between users and resources. All resources accessible from equipment
under a user's control, for example a dumb terminal, PC or workstation are
protected by strong authentication mechanism. Strong authentication is an
authentication mechanism that is resilient to eavesdropping and masquerade
attacks in the context of the communications network between user and system.

Authentication of connections to LAN nodes may be implemented using systems
based on Kerberos. (Further advice may be obtained from D&amp;P Data Security
Laboratories, see Section 11).<P>

Where there may be a number of separate LAN segments interconnected by
bridges or gateways, each individual LAN segment must comply with the access
control policy.<P>

<H4>3.4.4.3 Ordinary LANs</H4><P>

An Ordinary LAN is one which does not meet the security criteria for an Exclusive
or an Access-controlled LAN.<P>

<H4>3.4.4.4 LAN Usage</H4><P>

In general the following applies:<P>
<PRE>
LAN Type       Usage

Exclusive          In Strictest Confidence
Access Controlled  In Confidence
Ordinary           Non-Privacy marked

</PRE>
Note that use of a specific LAN architecture does not negate the use of other
mandatory features which may be required for handling sensitive information.<P>

The security of a LAN is a complex issue, especially when the mechanisms for
processing, storing, or transmitting sensitive information do not all offer the same
level of security. In this case contact the Commercial Security Unit for further
guidance.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.13: LOCAL AREA NETWORKS</H4><P>

A LAN shall be characterised as one of Exclusive, Access Controlled, or
Ordinary so that the owners, administrators, and users, are aware of the
security controls that must be enforced.<P>

<H4>3.5 Threats to networked systems</H4><P>

Four major threats exist to networked systems:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Disdosure of information stored or in transit on the network.

<LI>Masquerading as an authorised user.

<LI>Accidental or unauthorised modification, insertion or deletion of the information
stored or in transit on the network, and

<LI>Denial of the use of the network to those entitled to use it.
</OL>
<H4>3.5.1 Information disclosure</H4><P>

Much sensitive information (access information as well as user data) can be
gained from illicit interception of telecommunications signals by tapping and
bugging. These activities are usually committed against local lines rather than the
main network. This is because local plant is more accessible to illicit interception
and there is little or no confusion from other multiplexed signals.<P>

All forms of radio, microwave, infrared and other beam transmission techniques
are also vulnerable to interception.<P>

Four classes of countermeasures may be brought to bear to reduce the risk of
information disclosure. These are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Data separation,
<LI>Physical protection,
<LI>TEMPEST protection, and
<LI>Cryptographic protection.
</UL>
<H4>3.5.1.1 Data sparation</H4><P>

Depending on the architecture of the chosen network, information of varying
sensitivity may be in transit simultaneously across a single channel. Under these
circumstances, there needs to be a clear distinction between the level of sensitivity
of information. This can be achieved by either:<P>
<UL>
<LI>commencing a new single-level communications session each time there is a
change to the level of data sensitivity, or

<LI>Labelling each item of data with its sensitivity in such a way that the protocol used
on the multi-level channel provides clear indication of the sensitivity, and facilitates
unambiguous pairing between the label and the associated data received or sent.
</UL>
In either circumstance, the communication channel should be secured to handle
the most sensitive information that it is expected to carry.<P>

<H4>3.5.1.2 Physical protection</H4><P>

Because any network may be vulnerable to eavesdropping, special care must be
taken when transmitting highly sensitive information.<P>

Many networks are located in buildings that are considerably less secure than
purpose-built computer centres. When planning the installation of the network, the
guidelines and suggestions detailed in the section on Electronic Systems
Installations should be followed as far as possible.<P>

On these occasions, where it is operationally necessary to install networks in
insecure buildings, including those to which members of the public have access,
the following additional points must be considered:<P>
<UL>
<LI>cabling should be continuous and not be routed through areas where public
access is permitted. If this is not possible it should be contained in heavy duty
grounded metal conduit preferably requiring a specialised tool to remove the
inspection plates.

<LI>where sensitive information is likely to be transmitted on a network, consideration
should be given to using protected cable.

<LI>where sensitive information is transmitted, consideration should be given to
housing termination points, ie. wall mounted coaxial sockets, in proprietary
lockable metal boxes. These must be kept locked at all times when authorised
staff are not present.

<LI>after the installation of cabling, particularly when completed by outside contractors
and in a building not dedicated to BT use, the routing of the cable must be
thoroughly inspected to ensure that it meets the original specification and that it
has not been routed to locations which could be used by potential eavesdroppers.

<LI>the power switches of network connected terminals should be fitted with
proprietary lockable boxes (which are kept locked!).
</UL>
<H4>POLICY 3.21: NETWORK MONlTORING</H4><P>

The use of network monitoring equipment must be strictly controlled.<P>

<H4>3.5.1.3 Tempest protection</H4><P>

Communications lines, personal computers, Visual Display Units (VDUs) and
printers may radiate significant amounts of radio frequency energy and it is
possible for data displayed on a screen or being printed to be intercepted.
TEMPEST is the name of the technology that enables this unintentional radio
emission to be reduced to acceptable proportions. In practice the signals can only
be received over a short distance and identifying one particular VDU/printer
among several others is difficult. Although the threat may be real in some military
situations, for the commercial world it must be considered a threat only when the
information being handled is extremely sensitive.<P>

For specialist advice on the applicability and methods of TEMPEST protection,
refer to Section 10.<P>

<H4>3.5.1.4 Cryptographic protection</H4><P>

The use of cryptographic techniques is not limited in its application to the
protection of communications networks. This topic is covered in the Cyptographic
Protection section.<P>

<H4>3.5.2 Unauthorised access</H4><P>

Connection requests across a network should be verified as to their authenticity.
The chosen authentication mechanism should not place undue or unwarranted
trust on the network to carry the authentication information accurately or in
secrecy unless it has been proved able to carry out that function. Care should be
taken to ensure that the chosen mechanisms for user authentication are
sufficiently strong and that they are managed correctly.<P>

It is important to realise that user authentication information is carried across the
network and should be appropriately protected, that is, with the same rigour as
that afforded to the information that it protects. If cryptographic methods are used
to facilitate access control, then the algorithm, configuration and key management
must be approved by the Director of Security and Investigation. Where
cryptographic keys are shared, a method of personal authentication should be
used in addition.<P>

If a strong method of authentication (eg. a one time password) is used, then this
may be adequate as the sole means of authentication. Otherwise, in addition to
personal authentication, authentication of the recipient's point of entry to the
communications network is required. To be acceptable this must reliably identify
the recipient as being at a fixed physical location. This location must be
authenticated as one at which the recipient may receive the information. Suitable
methods are dependent on the type of connection and are as follows:<P>
<UL>
<LI>PRIVATE CIRCUIT - The recipient should be connected via a private circuit to a
fixed location.

<LI>PUBLIC DATA NETWORK - The recipient should be at an authorised fixed
address which is verified by the originator, or should be a member of an
authorised CUG, or authenticated by a one-time password system in the network.

<LI>PUBLIC SWITCHED TELEPHONE NETWORK- The recipient should be at an
authorised fixed address which is verified by the originator by dialling-out or by a
dialback device approved by the Director of Security and Investigation.

<LI>INTEGRATED DIGITAL ACCESS - The recipient should be at an authorised
address which is verified by the originator by dialling-out or by checking the
Calling Line Identification.

<LI>LOCALAREA NETWORKS - The recipient should be at an authorised port on an
access-controlled LAN, or at any port on an exclusive LAN.

<LI>OTHER DATA NETWORKS - The recipient should be at an authorised port on a
BT-only data network which does not use broadcast transmission.
</UL>

<H4>POLICY 3.14: NETWORK ORIGIN AUTHENTICATION</H4><P>

The identity of network users shall be authenticated. Where the method of
authentication is weak, strong technical methods shall be employed to
determine the point of access of the originator into the network.<P>

<H4>3.5.2.1 Dialback</H4><P>

The security of dial in access may be enhanced by providing an 'Automatic
Dialback' facility whereby the caller is forced, at the outset of a call, to declare his
identity to the system. The equipment terminates the call and dials the caller on a
different outgoing-only line using a telephone number it associates with the
caller's declared identity. This prevents access from arbitrary telephone locations
and offers an audit and accountability mechanism.<P>

Some types of dialback device may be defeated by quite simple techniques, and
therefore do not give the intended protection. Only the system administrator
should be able to modify the list of authorised telephone numbers stored in the
dialback equipment. Dialback systems used to protect BT's commercially sensitive
information must be approved by the Director of Security and Investigation.<P>

In some systems manual dialback may be appropriate, however, whether dialback
is automatic or manual, a full log of each access should be maintained. Because
Dialback units only provide authentication of the point of entry into the Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), other measures should be taken for High
Impact Systems.<P>

Dialback techniques can be rendered ineffective if the exchange offers a Call
Diversion facility.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.15: DIALBACK</H4><P>

Where the method of network user authentication is weak, the point of access
into the network shall be established using a dialback unit that has been
approved by the Director of Security and Investigation.<P>

<H4>3.5.3 Modification, insertion and deletion</H4><P>

Special measures may need to be taken to ensure that information is not lost or
corrupted in transit across a network. For example, message sequence numbers
can be used to detect the accidental or deliberate deletion or insertion of entire
blocks of information in the information stream.<P>

Accidental modification of the information in transit can be detected by the use of
comparatively simple techniques, for example checksums or Cyclic Redundancy
Checks (CRCs). Where it is anticipated that deliberate attempts will be made to
modify information then cryptographic techniques may be appropriate.<P>

Cryptographic techniques may be used to prove:<P>
<UL>
<LI>that data has not been modified,
<LI>the identity of the originator of information,
<LI>that information has been delivered to its intended destination, and
<LI>the source of information into a network.
</UL>
Note that the adoption of cryptographic techniques for one purpose may offer the
opportunity of other checks. For example, the adoption of Digital Signatures will
provide a facility to enable the detection of accidental or deliberate modification of
information. Cryptographic techniques are technically difficult to design and
implement such that their use and management is not prone to errors and
subsequent security failures. Because of this, the use of any such equipment must
have the approval of the Director of Security and Investigation.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.16: DIGITAL SIGNATURES</H4><P>

In the design of systems where proof of origin of a message must be
ascertained, Digital Signature techniques shall be considered and documented.<P>

<H4>POLICY3.17: NON REPUDIATION SERVICES</H4><P>

In the design of systems where it is necessary to prove that the intended
recipient has received information, cryptographic techniques to manufacture an
incontrovertible receipt note shall be considered and documented.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.18: DATA ORIGIN AUTHENTICATION</H4><P>

In the design of systems where there is a requirement to prove the identity of
the origin of data then cryptographic techniques shall be considered and
documented.<P>

<H4>3.5.4 Denial or failure of service</H4><P>

In the office environment there is generally no need to provide fallback
communication systems as the standard response time for fault correction is
adequate for most requirements. However, for systems which use private circuits
or the PSS as the prime means of communication, it is worth considering using
PSTN as a fallback for nonsensitive data provided that the PSTN connection is not
made permanent.<P>

At purpose-built computer centres the situation is somewhat different as most
systems would become useless in the event of loss of their communications links.
Some link redundancy is generally necessary to protect against this.
Communication links that are provisioned as backup should if possible, be
terminated on different hardware in the system and routed via different cable
ducts and transmission routes so as to minimise the danger of loss of both links in
the event of a hardware failure.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.19: NEIWORK AVAILABILITY</H4><P>

In the design of systems, measures shall be taken to ensure that the availability
of the network satisfies the system's requirement.<P>

<H4>3.6 Cryptographic protection</H4><P>

Modern encryption techniques are regarded as offering a formidable barrier to
any adversary and probably an insurmountable barrier unless substantial
computing power is available or the key and algorithm are compromised.<P>

The use of cryptographic techniques can contribute significantly to security by
offering strong mechanisms to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>authenticate the user,
<LI>authenticate the calling location,
<LI>assure message integrity,
<LI>maintain the confidentiality of messages.
</UL>
The use of encryption is not without operational problems some of which are
listed below:<P>
<UL>
<LI>encryption packages inevitably involve an overhead in terms of key management
and administration although, in some public key systems, this overhead is
reduced.

<LI>serious problems can arise if individuals forget their keys or become indisposed
etc. As a precaution, it may be prudent to keep duplicate cryptographic keys or
copies of the files in unencrypted form. Any such duplicates must be kept securely.

<LI>encrypted information may contain control characters which make it a
prerequisite that any protocol used to transmit a file electronically is completely
transparent to the file contents. It is likely that encrypted data would interfere with
many network operating systems. As a result either considerable tailoring of a
system or specially developed encryption packages would be required to enable
encrypted data to be transmitted.

<LI>some encryption systems are not suitable for every type of network so expert
advice must be sought.
</UL>
Encryption systems used to protect BT's commercially sensitive information must
be approved by the Director of Security and Investigation.<P>

<H4>POLICY 3.20: APPROVAL OF USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY</H4><P>

Any cryptographic techniques or encryption systems selected to safeguard BT
information shall have been approved by the Director of Security and
Investigation prior to their use.<P>

<H4>3.7 Electronic Mail Systems</H4><P>

There are considerable risks associated with current electronic mail systems. In
particular, data may be forged, altered, redirected or intercepted. Although
techniques are being developed to solve many of these problems, users of
electronic mail systems should be aware of their present limitations. The advice
given here is for guidance and is intended to highlight areas of concern. In the
future specific policies will be produced to cover electronic mail security.<P>

<H4>Authentication</H4><P>

Currently, most systems authenticate users by means of User IDs and passwords.
This is not a strong means of authenticating users. Electronic mail systems should
not be used as a means of providing authorisation to other individuals for carrying
out tasks unless they have been specified, designed and installed for that purpose.
For example, it should not be possible to requisition goods on the basis of an
uncorroborated electronic mail message. At present, in the UK, a handwritten
signature is a legally-binding proof of authorisation. Electronic mail systems using
weak authentication do not offer the required level of proof and assurance of the
origination of a message. Designers of electronic mail systems should look at
currently-available technologies which offer scope for proof of origination.<P>

<H4>Integrity</H4><P>

Without appropriate coding techniques, messages may easily be intercepted and
modified or replayed. Designers of systems should ensure that the threats are
understood and that appropriate countermeasures are adopted. Digital signatures
can be used very effectively to ensure the integrity and authenticity of a message.<P>

<H4>Labelling</H4><P>

Labelling is a way of attaching a marker to a message, file or segment of data, to
indicate a specific attribute. Often the attribute is the sensitivity of the information.
Systems which make use of labels are able to utilise sophisticated access methods
for permitting access to data An example might be a system which permitting IN
CONFIDENCE material to be redirected to a colleague for action, perhaps
because of holiday arrangements, but which did not permit STAFF IN
CONFIDENCE material to be so directed.<P>

<H4>Mail redirection</H4><P>

Automatic electronic mail redirection should not be used unless it is possible for
the message originator to know that message redirection is in operation.<P>

<H4>Account usage</H4><P>

Where it is operationally necessary for another person to use an electronic mail
account for a short time, it is imperative that a hand over is arranged in a manner
which ensures:<P>
<UL>
<LI>that any password is only known by one person

<LI>that the time period during which the account is temporarily managed by the
other person is documented and recorded by the system manager.
</UL>
The system manager is the only person authorised to make and record such a
change, and must ensure that the required written authorisation is signed by the
user.<P>
