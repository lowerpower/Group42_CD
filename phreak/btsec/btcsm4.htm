<H4>4.1 Introduction</H4><P>

Security of significant computer or network installations concerns not only the
security of the computer and electronic hardware but also the protection of
systems in general, software, user data, media library facilities, communications
networks and the safety and well being of personnel.<P>

These installations need to be protected against the effects of events such as fire,
flood, loss of power, failure of air-conditioning and ancillary plant and damage by
natural or man-made hazards. This chapter should be read in conjunction with the
Physical Security Handbook.<P>

<H4>4.2 Accommodation</H4><P>

During the planning of an electronic installation due consideration must be given
to both the location of the building that will house the equipment and the
placement of the equipment within the building as this has a direct effect on the
overall security requirements.<P>

The following factors must be considered when selecting installation sites:<P>
<UL>
<LI>natural disasters,
<LI>civil unrest,
<LI>neighbouring accommodation,
<LI>fire.
</UL>
<H4>4.2.1 Natural disasters</H4><P>
Certain natural disasters could either severely damage the installation directly, or
prevent its operation by unavailability of staff.<P>

These include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Local flooding including fracture of air conditioning or water cooling equipment,
<LI>Local landslide, subsidence and so on,
<LI>exceptional weather conditions.
</UL>
<H4>4.2.2 Civil unrest</H4><P>
Electronic system installations might be popular targets for attack by politically
motivated groups and individuals as well as by mobs. It is undesirable that an
electronic system site should be in a vicinity with:<P>
<UL>
<LI>unusually high risk of mob violence,
<LI>unusually high incidence of criminal and malicious damage,
<LI>unusually high risk terrorist activity.
</UL>
If such a site is unavoidable, additional levels of physical security may be
appropriate.<P>

<H4>4.2.3 Neighbouring accommodation</H4><P>
Even if the areas housing the electronic system equipment are well designed,
there could be possible hazards from incompatible neighbouring accommodation
both internal and external to the equipment such as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>staff restaurants, fuel storage areas (risk of fire),
<LI>washrooms, piped water facilities and tanks (risk of flood),
<LI>electrical generator rooms, railways, radio and radar transmitting stations (risk of
vibration and electromagnetic interference).
</UL>
<H4>POLICY 4.1: SlTlNG OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS</H4><P>

The physical siting and location of an electronic system shall be planned with
due regard to security considerations from the inception of the planning
process. The effects of natural disasters, civil unrest and threats from
incompatible neighbouring accommodation shall be taken into consideration
when planning purpose-built electronic system installations.<P>

<H4>4.2.4 Fire</H4><P>
Fire remains one of the most serious of all security hazards especially in data
preparation and media library areas where large quantities of combustible material
are present and electronic equipment is often allowed to run unattended.
Detailed advice on fire precautions must be sought from local fire safety experts
but the main considerations are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>limitation of whole-building fire risk,
<LI>limitation of fire risk in main computer and electronic system room,
<LI>Iimitation of fire risk in data preparation areas.
</UL>
The necessary preventative measures include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>partitioning of the installation into fire compartments,

<LI>use of fire-retardant construction materials,
automatic fire detection equipment,

<LI>automatic fire alarm systems (may be linked directly to local fire station),

<LI>automatic fire suppression equipment (especially Halon gas or similar systems in
the main computer and electronic system room. The traditional view is that
sprinklers are inappropriate here because of the affect of water on the electronic
hardware. Halon has environmental and safety problems so expert advice must be
sought.),

<LI>manual fire fighting equipment, and

<LI>enforcement of fire safety procedures (such as no smoking areas) .
For specific guidance you should refer to Chapter 10 for the BT Fire Safety
Manager in the BT Safety Unit.
</UL>
<H4>POLICY 4.2: FIRE THREATS</H4><P>

The threat and impact of fire shall be taken into consideration when planning
dedicated electronic systems installations.<P>

<H4>4.3 Services</H4><P>

The security of services and especially electric light and power should be
considered where appropriate during the siting of electronic system installations.
Provisions may need to be made to cater for a growth in requirements.<P>

<H4>4.3.1 Electrical power</H4><P>

Standby power sources should be available for all systems where availability has
been identified as important. Any emergency power supplies should provide
no-break protection otherwise data will be corrupted during switching. It should
be tested regularly and there should be sufficient fuel available. When the power
load of a unit is extended, checks should be carried out to ensure the power of the
standby source is sufficient.<P>

Standby power should be invoked not only in the event of total disruption of
primary power, but also at any time that primary power falls outside (above or
below) the equipment manufacturer's specification. Standby power should also be
available to ensure continued operation of all security monitoring and access
control devices. The provision of adequate monitoring facilities should enable
switch over to occur before the equipment manufacturer's specification is
exceeded.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.3: EMERGENCY POWER SUPPLY</H4><P>

Electronic systems shall be safeguarded from the threat of disrupted electric
power by the provision of standby power facilities where appropriate.<P>

Power supplies used for systems containing high-sensitivity or high-availability
applications and data must be monitored periodically to ensure sufficient quality of
power for the safe and reliable operation of these systems.<P>

Computer systems are extremely sensitive to the quality of power delivered. Good
grounding, "clean" isolated power (no transient voltage spikes, brownouts, sags,
intermittent losses) and reliable connections and cabling are essential. Preferably,
these should be verified prior to the installation of a system.<P>

For all applicable systems, the power conditions should be measured at the point
where power is applied to the system cabinets or boxes. Periodic checks should
be supplemented by checks done when known power conditions change due to
modifications in electrical supply or load.<P>

Power distribution panels, cabinets and rooms must be considered sensitive areas
and protected appropriately.<P>

<H4>4.3.2 Maintenance of local environments</H4><P>

For electronic systems requiring a controlled environment (temperature and
humidity) main and standby air conditioning facilities should also be provided.
Any vents to the outside should also be physically secured to prevent intruders.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.4: MAINTENANCE OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENT</H4><P>

The threat of electronic systems operating outside of their specified
temperature and humidity ranges shall be minimised by provision of adequate
equipment.<P>

<H4>4.4 Electronic system equipment sign posting</H4><P>

The location of electronic system equipment within a building, for example
connection points, communications frames, has a direct effect on the overall
security arrangements and must be considered carefully.<P>

Ideally, computer and electronic systems should be located above ground level,
but below the top floor and away from exterior windows. It is preferable that the
installation should be windowless and with no equipment visible from outside the
building. Windows not only represent a security hazard but also can have an
adverse effect on environmental controls. All external signposts of the facility or
obvious displays should be minimised.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.5: SIGN POSIING OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS</H4><P>

Buildings housing electronic systems shall not be obviously marked or
signposted.<P>

<H4>4.5 Physical access control strategy</H4><P>

General site security is never a substitute for control of direct access to the
electronic system installation, which must always be a secure area in its own right.<P>

Physical security is enhanced by enforcing several layers of defence, often called
'Defence in depth'. Access to the site should be controlled through a manned
station which, in turn, regulates entry to buildings—specifically those housing
important electronic systems. Further access controls can then be enforced at the
entrance to the general computing area, and again at the doors to rooms
containing the computer and electronic systems, communications plant and media
library.<P>

In summary, access to the actual computing and electronic system facility must
not be possible except<P>
<UL>
<LI>past a manned station, or
<LI>through locked doors requiring speciat keys or codes to open.
</UL>
To ensure compliance with a system security policy it may be a requirement that
sensitive systems are separated physically as well as logically.<P>

For more specific advice and guidance, refer to the Physical Securiy Handbook.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.6: PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROLS</H4><P>

In the design of systems, physical access controls shall be implemented so as
to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive areas.<P>

Small installations which cannot economically justify a manned station but use
access control methods shall record the issue and receipt of keys, and, where
oractical, their use.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.7: SECURlTY OF UNATTENDED BUILDING</H4><P>

Sensitive installations in unattended buildings should be physically secure and
alarmed through to an alarm monitoring station.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.8: PHYSICAL SECURlTY HANDBOOK</H4><P>

In the planning of accommodation and siting of electronic systems attention
shall be paid to the recommendations and guidance documented in the
Physical Security Handbook.<P>

<H4>4.5.1  Access to secure areas</H4><P>

Subject to fire regulations, there should be a minimum number of physical access
points to the secure area housing the electronic system installation, preferably one
usual portal and one emergency exit, the latter opening outwards only from the
installation.<P>

Even if authorised staff are present in the vicinity of computer and electronic
systems, all routes of entry should normally be locked; the use of self-closing and
self-locking doors is recommended.<P>

<H4>4.5.2 Data cabinets and safes</H4><P>

In addition to the access controls, physical protection for the data itself must be
provided. A Data Cabinet or Data Safe is used to protect magnetic media against
hazards such as Fire, Dust, Pilferage, Accidental or Malicious damage and the
effects of water from sprinklers. Where the information recorded on the magnetic
media warrants a higher level of physical security, the Data Cabinet or Safe should
be kept in a Strongroom or a proprietary Security Safe.<P>

IN CONFIDENCE and encrypted IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE marked media
may be stored in Data Cabinets, provided correct procedures are in force for the
control of the data cabinet keys or combination locks. Unencrypted IN
STRICTEST CONFIDENCE marked media may also be stored on an occasional
basis. For regular storage of small quantities of IN CONFIDENCE or unencrypted
IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE marked media, a data insert for filing cabinets is
available which may be used to store such media in approved security furniture.<P>

For further advice, refer to the Information Security Code.<P>

There are standing arrangements for the purchase of Data Safes; refer to Chapter
10 for further information.<P>

<H4>4.6 Personnel access</H4><P>

<H4>4.6.1 Staff, official visitors and other personnel</H4><P>

Access to sensitive computer and electronic system installations should be allowed
only to those with a genuine need to perforrn their duties. Other personnel
(maintenance engineers, cleaners) must conform with a formal logging procedure
for entry. They should be accompanied at all times. A visitor remains the
responsibility of the host for the duration of the visit.<P>

All personnel, including visitors and non-BT staff such as cleaners and
maintenance engineers, must be issued with passcards. The style of the passcards
should be such that the bearer can be identified as regular staff or a visitor, as
such, the passcard must be displayed clearly at all times whilst within the building.<P>

Special consideration should be given to controlling the access of ancillary
personnel such as cleaners and service engineers (BT and non-B. Temporary
changes such as building work or accommodation moves must not be used to
justify a relaxation in procedures. Special arrangements should be made to
accommodate these.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.9: PERSONNEL IN SENSITIVE AREAS</H4><P>

Only authorised people shall have access to sensitive areas. Procedures shall be
in place and maintained to control the access of external maintenance
engineers or other personnel.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.10: MANAGEMENT AND USE OF PASSCARDS</H4><P>

Passcards shall be issued and worn at all times. Their style shall be such as to
enable a clear distinction between regular staff, BT and non-BT visitors.<P>

For specific advice and guidance, the Information Security Code applies.<P>

<H4>4.6.2 'General interest' visits</H4><P>

Although BT wishes to maintain good relations with the community, general
visitors are not permitted into operational computer centres. Visits to associated
premises may be permitted but should not be actively encouraged. Any request for
a visit should be considered on its merits by local management.<P>

When a visit is arranged, the following measures must be taken to minimise the
risk:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Formal entry and exit procedures must be scrupulously followed.

<LI>V-lsitors must be issued with passcards.

<LI>Parties must be organised so that they are of manageable size so as to ensure that
all visitors are accompanied and supervised at all times. A ratio of five visitors to
each BT guide one of whom must be at least a level 2 manager (MPG4), is
suggested.

<LI>The route and timetable must be preplanned and strictly followed so as to avoid all
sensitive areas.

<LI>Areas of work which are demonstrated must be selected to avoid close up viewing
of sensitive information (such as logging on procedures, network access numbers
and customer data) .

<LI>Staff must be given adequate warning of impending visits so that sensitive material
and access methods can be concealed.

<LI>Passwords must be changed after any such visit if it is considered that any have
been compromised.

<LI>Any handouts must have been authorised by the local manager in accordance with
the Information Security Code.

<LI>The carrying by visitors of cameras and electronic devices capable of interference
with computer systems must be prohibited.
</OL>
<H4>POLICY 4.11: GENERAL INTEREST VISlTS</H4><P>

Local rules governing visitors and visits shall be documented. Visitors shall be
guided so as to exclude them from all sensitive areas. Refer to the Physical
Securi Handbook for guidance.<P>

<H4>4.7 System or master consoles</H4><P>

Controls against unauthorised activity are essential on electronic access to
computer and electronic system facilities, in particular over communications links
but also to computer and electronic system consoles. System or master consoles
usually provide access to highly privileged activities, for example system
administration and software or machine maintenance; others may provide
enhanced operator privileges necessary for efficient machine usage.<P>

Master consoles must be located in the most physically secure environment
available within the computer and electronic system building complex to prevent
unauthorised use of the console. The consoles must be sited so that use may not
be overlooked and cabled so that their traffic cannot be intercepted.<P>

Access to master consoles must be restricted and all operations recorded. The log
or journal should be regularly scrutinised to identify any signs of irregular or
unauthorised usage.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.12: USE OF SYSTEM CONSOLES</H4><P>

Procedures concerning the proper use of primary system consoles or system
terminals shall be documented and the application of those procedures
enforced.<P>

<H4>4.8 Other terminals</H4><P>

Terminals outside the computer and electronic system room should not have
access to operator or other special privileges. Other users which might need
access to privileged commands might include software support groups, network
management groups and remote software engineers. If privileged access is
required, and the temporary use of a terminal other than the primary or system
console cannot be avoided, its use should be strictly controlled, supervised and, in
some circumstances, audited.<P>

Terminals located in non-BT buildings deserve special attention to ensure that
their use cannot compromise the security of BT systems to which they may be
connected.<P>

<H4>4.9 Communications rooms and equipment</H4><P>

All communications equipment must be sited in a physically secure environment
within the installation and must be subject to their own restricted access controls.
Where it is not possible to locate communications equipment within dedicated
accommodation then the equipment itself should be physically secured in purpose
built lockable furniture.<P>

Cable entry points, risers and runs shall be provided with adequate protection to
prevent unauthorised access, and accidental or deliberate damage.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.13: COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT PHYSICAL SECURITY</H4><P>

Communications equipment shall be located in its own secure environment or
in secure furniture and subject to restricted access control appropriate to the
sensitivity of the data being communicated.<P>

<H4>4.10 Media libraries and disaster stores</H4><P>

Special care must be taken to safeguard media libraries and disaster stores. Data
held in a compact form is particularly vulnerable to accidental or malicious
damage and its security depends on physical protective measures, access control
and staff reliability.<P>

Both the media library and the disaster store must be restricted to specifically
authorised staff.<P>

The disaster store must be sited so that it will be unaffected by any incident at the
computer centre. It must also be sited so that the contents are not affected by
strong electromagnetic influences. See the Physical Security Handbook for further
guidance.<P>

<H4>POLICY 4.14: DISASTER STORE</H4><P>

Any disaster store shall be physically protected and remote from the computer
centre. Access to the store shall be governed by local operational instructions.<P>
