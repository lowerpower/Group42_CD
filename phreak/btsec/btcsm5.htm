<H4>5.1 Introduction</H4><P>

Personal Computers (PCs) are often sited in open plan offices and, as such, are
accessible by many people. In general, PCs and their peripherals can be removed
more easily than other types of computer. Due to these two facts, PCs are more
vulnerable than equipment housed in purpose built accommodation, for example
dedicated computer centres, and so require additional provisions for their
protection.<P>
The following threats are more likely:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the theft of PC or peripherals,
<LI>the theft or damage to the information stored on the PC,
<LI>accidental or malicious physical damage, and
<LI>the possibility of screens displaying sensitive information being overlooked.
</UL>
Some deterrent against theft can be offered by clearly marking equipment with
the name and office address of the person responsible for the equipment. The
serial numbers of the equipments should also be recorded.<P>
PC users should pay careful attention to the environment of the machine:<P>
<UL>
<LI>ensure vents on the PC are not blocked by printout, manuals etc.
<LI>eating, drinking and smoking while using a PC can cause damage to the machine
and should therefore be avoided.
</UL>
When choosing a site for the machine in an open plan office, ensure that
consideration has been given to the confidentiality required for data on the
machine. In particular ensure that visitors or people outside a building cannot
overlook the screen if sensitive information is displayed.<P>

<H4>5.1.1 Use outside BT premises</H4><P>

There are dangers in using PCs outside BT premises, for example, on trains or at
home. These threats include the increased possibility of theft, the likelihood of
onlookers and potential damage by extending access to inexperienced users. An
unprotected communications link may also present a security risk. Managers
must consider carefully whether the risks involved are justified.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.1: USE OF BT COMPUTING EQUIPMENT OUTSIDE BT
PREMISES</H4><P>

Privacy marked or commercially sensitive information shall not be processed
on portable computers anywhere other than BT premises unless the computer
or the information stored therein is adequately protected.<P>

<H4>5.2 Personal security responsibility</H4><P>

Fundamental to good security is control. Control of access and resources can only
be achieved by co-ordination. For this reason it is important to distinguish
between the person responsible for a personal computer (PC) and those that use it.
Although the actual assignment of responsibilities for personal computers is a
local management issue, the following issues shall be addressed by the person
nominated as responsible for the PC:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Physical security of the PC,
<LI>Controlling the access of individuals to the PC,
<LI>Ensuring that users are aware of their responsibilities,
<LI>Controlling external access to the PC (LANs, PSI N etc),
<LI>Backup of software (see contingency planning section),
<LI>Maintain a list of the software and hardware,
<LI>Co-ordinate maintenance engineers access,
<LI>Regular audit of PC hardware and software against licences held.
</UL>
The users of the PC should be made aware of their responsibilities by the person
who controls the PC. Authorisation should only be granted if the proposed user
accepts the responsibilities in writing.<P>
The responsibilities of the users must include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>To use only legitimate authorised and licensed socware from a proven source,
<LI>To ensure that no sensitive data is put on the hard disk (unless it is equipped with
appropriate protection),
<LI>To ensure that they take backups of their data at appropriate intervals,
<LI>To read and abide by the guidance of the Computer Security Manual and the
Information Security Code.
</UL>
Where the person responsible for the machine is also the user of the machine, the
duties of audit and checking outlined above fall upon that individual's line manager
or nominated representative.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.2: CONTROL OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS</H4><P>

Every personal computer shall have a named individual who is responsible for
controlling its use.<P>

The owner must maintain a list of sensitive data in a secure place, in addition to
the list of applications. The degree of compromise should local data be lost must
be known.<P>
Any user who stores sensitive data on servers used by the PC must never assume
that backups are being done. It is incumbent upon the user to verify the server
conditions.<P>

<H4>5.3 PC and data access security</H4><P>

Many PCs are sited in open-plan offices and there may be no particular physical
security measures to restrict access to the processor, network features or
peripherals. For this reason, care needs to be exercised over the use of the PC and
access to the data. The criteria for choosing suitable controls should be the
sensitivity of the data processed, and the physical environment (who may have
physical access to the PC).<P>

To assess the sensitivity of the data it is necessary to consider the effect of a loss
of confidentiality (to competitors, to the press, to other employees etc.); the effect
of inaccurate data or incomplete data, and the effect if data on the PC were
unavailable. The implications of the Data Protection Act and other legislation and
regulatory issues should also be considered.<P>
The security principles to be borne in mind are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Need to know,
<LI>Need to modify,
<LI>Individual responsibility, and
<LI>Accountability.
</UL>
To enforce these security principles access to the PC, and more importantly to
data must be controlled. It is important to segregate data into compartments so as
to ensure that the security principles can be enforced. This can be achieved by use
of removable disks, or by encryption of individual files on a hard disk.<P>

While it is not always practicable for PCs to be locked in a room if they operated
unattended, access to their contents must be restricted. Without adequate
protection, the PC, the data it is processing, and networks to which it may be
connected are at risk not only from unauthorised access but also accidental or
deliberate corruption.<P>

An unprotected and unattended PC is vulnerable to being used to run
unauthorised software, for example games, which may carry a computer virus.
Some security can be achieved by:<P>
<UL>
<LI>provision of key locks to safeguard internal pre-set hardware,
<LI>physical locks to prevent use of the floppy disk drive,
<LI>hardware-based password protection invoked during the startup procedure,
<LI>an add-in hardware assisted access control protection device,
<LI>hardware-based data encryption,
<LI>removable hard-disks.
</UL>
<H4>5.3.1 Key locks</H4><P>

A PC may have a key lock built into it. Some of these locks give a degree of
security by disabling the processor power unit. Others may simply disable the
screen or keyboard.<P>

There is also a (somewhat limited) range of external locks for most PCs. These
locks can be fitted over the mains and auxiliary power switches to the processor
thus preventing unauthorised operation of the computer and providing safeguards
against theft of hard disks, plug-in cards and the system unit.<P>

Lockable devices may also be fitted over, or into, the floppy disk unit so guarding
against loading of unauthorised software.<P>

<H4>5.3.2 Password protection</H4><P>

There are numerous proprietary packages available which control access to the
PC operating system and disk storage by means of a user ID and password
system. Some of these packages depend on the installation of a plug-in card within
the PC, others are totally software-controlled. In some cases encryption of files on
the hard disk is an option, however the following points must be considered
before using this facility:<P>
<UL>
<LI>whether or not the password protection can be circumvented,
<LI>whether the method of encryption (the algorithm) is strong enough,
<LI>whether the danger exists that encrypted files could accidentally or deliberately
become corrupted and irretrievable.
</UL>
For technical guidance, refer to Chapter 10 for contacts.<P>

<H4>5.3.2.1 Protection of data on non-removable disks</H4><P>

Files resident on fixed disks are particularly vulnerable. Unless an encryption
system approved by the Director of Security and Investigation is used or the PC is
protected by other suitable means, sensitive data must not be stored on
non-removable disks.<P>

Many application programs used on personal computers use the (often larger and
faster) non-removable disk to temporarily store user data automatically, even if the
file being edited is being held on removable media After processing, the
temporary files are deleted from the disk; the data, however, remains intact until
the space it is occupying is ovenvritten by another file. Many word-processing
packages and similar programs produce back-up files and these also need to be
erased.<P>

PCs on which has been loaded unknown or unauthorised software are particularly
vulnerable to attack by a Trojan Horse which may copy software or sensitive data
in a way that is unobserved and unknown by the usual PC user. Trojan Horse
software is often distributed by means of a computer virus.<P>

Files deleted from disks, for example with the DOS DELETE command can be
easily recovered as only the directory entry is amended to indicate the disk space
is free for reuse; the data remains intact on the disk until it is overwritten. To
completely delete a file it must be erased by overwriting it with zeros or a random
data pattern. For increased privacy, this may need to be performed several times
in succession. There are third-party programs available to do this.<P>

Files stored on file servers, such Novell's Network Operating System (NOS),
when deleted, are actually moved to a 'deleted' directory, still accessible by system
administrators. These files are not fully deleted until the Deleted directory space
is exhausted. Administrators should set up procedures for the automatic deletion
of these files. Copies may also exist on backup tapes.<P>

Should a non-removable disk, or a PC containing a non-removable disk, require
maintenance, special precautions may be necessary to render unusable any
information contained on the disk. If an approved encryption system is used on a
non-removable disk, the privacy marking then applies only to the encryption key
protecting that information. If the information is very sensitive, it may be
appropriate to destroy the disk using destruction procedures approved by the
Director of Security and Investigations. See also Software And Data: Disposal Of
Media for policies on this subject.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.3: STORAGE OF DATA ON NON-REMOVABLE DISKS</H4><P>

Any personal computer fitted with a non-removable disk and containing privacy
marked information shall be handled and stored accordingly. IN
CONFIDENCE data shall be protected by an approved software access control
and IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE data protected by a hardware based access
control and encryption system approved by the Director of Security and
Investigation.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.4: SENSITIVE DATA PROCESSED ON A PERSONAL COMPUTER</H4><P>

When using a personal computer with a non-removable disk to process
sensitive information, even if the data is held on a removable disk, the
non-removable disk shall be assumed to contain sensitive information, and be
treated appropriately.<P>

<H4>5.3.3 Removable disks and cassettes</H4><P>

All disks and cassettes must be put away when not in use. To guard against
extraneous magnetic influences they should be stored away from any electrical
equipment. Any removable media which contain sensitive information should be
clearly labelled with the appropriate privacy marking. If sensitive information is
being held they must be locked away in a suitable cabinet or drawer appropriate to
its privacy marking. Lockable plastic disk cases by themselves are not sufficient
protection.<P>

CSM Policy 7.17: MARKING OF MEDIA applies.<P>

<H4>5.3.4 Protection of data in memomy</H4><P>

Random Access Memory (RAM) is the PC's working memory. It holds the
programs currently running and the data currently being processed.
Frequently-accessed data on a floppy or non-removable disk may be loaded into
RAM to improve access time. When the PC is powered off, RAM is normally
erased. On some PCs, however, data in RAM is saved when the power is turned
off, and can be reloaded when the power is turned on again.<P>

Some multitasking Operating Systems (OSs), such as UNIX in all its variants,
OS/2 and Microsoft Windows manage virtual memory areas on a per process
basis. When free memory becomes low on such systems, parts of memory are
written out to a special disk area managed by the OS. The data remains on disk
and can be accessed by persons familiar with the OS.<P>

Some OSs also generate memory dumps when the system malfunctions, at which
point some, if not all, of memory is written out to disk before the system goes
down. It may, under certain circumstances, be advantageous to make this
information available to vendor representatives to help debug the problem, but the
security implications associated with doing this must be assessed.<P>

If sensitive data is held on a PC and the operating system uses virtual memory, or
RAM, is saved when the PC is powered off, then the person responsible must
protect the PC in accordance with Policies 5.3 and 5.4.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.5: RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY</H4><P>

Where there is a possibility that an unauthorised person may have gained
access to an unattended Personal Computer, it shall be switched off to clear
volatile memory.<P>

PCs containing non-volatile memory shall be protected as though they
contained a non-removable disk.<P>

<H4>5.3.5 Hard copy (printouts)</H4><P>

Where resources such as printers are shared, or several are available, special
precautions should be effected to ensure privacy marked material is not seen by,
or delivered to an inappropriate person.<P>

Printout should always have the appropriate privacy marking clearly displayed at
the top and bottom of each page and handled in accordance with the appropriate
rules in the Information Security Code. Partial printouts, perhaps resulting from
failures or aborted print runs, should be disposed of in accordance with their
intended privacy marking. Note that many printers contain a memory which holds
information used for printing. In the event of failure during a print this information
may remain in memory until the printer is powered off.<P>

Because some personal computers (and dumb terminals) offer the facility to take a
printed copy of the contents of the screen (for example, screen dumps or print
screen), each screen displayed should contain the sensitivity marking for that
information.<P>

It should be noted that most laser printers hold a copy of the last printed page on
the laser printer drum and that it is a relatively easy task to read this page of
information directly from the drum.Therefore, whenever particularly sensitive
information is printed on is type of device, the user should consider printing a
full page of non-sensitive text in order to overwrite the previous page.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.6: MANAGEMENT OF PRINTERS</H4><P>

A Procedure shall be prepared and implemented when a shared or networked
printer is used for producing privacy marked material.<P>

Printing over networked printers introduces additional possibilities for the
compromise of sensitive information. The network, comprising both the hardware
and software, maintains buffers for information to be printed. In some cases the
data remains in the buffers after printing has occurred. The buffers may be
accessed by unauthorised users or by mistake and data compromised. Sensitive
information should only be printed to approved print locations where an analysis
has been done on the security risks.<P>

<H4>5.4 Security of software</H4><P>

Only legitimate (licensed) authorised copies of software from reputable sources
supplied by a secure distribution mechanism should be used on PCs.<P>

Any software from colleges etc, legitimately used by BT students, for instance,
should be checked for hazardous code before loading as this is a potential source
of viruses or untrustworthy software.<P>

Computer games are recognised as a source of computer viruses and their use is
explicitly forbidden.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.7: PUBLIC DOMAIN AND OTHER UNTRUSTWORTHY
SOFTWARE</H4><P>

Public domain and other untrustworthy software shall not be held or used on
BT's personal computers. Exemptions to this policy may only be granted by the
Director of Security and Investigation if there is a proven operational need.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.8: GAMES</H4><P>

Games shall not be used on BT's personal computers. Games must not be
loaded onto BT's personal computers except where they come as part of a
legitimate business sofhvare package and there is no facility for not installing
the games. Exemptions to this policy may only be granted by the Director of
Security and Investigation if there is a proven business need.<P>

<H4>5.5 Personal computer communications</H4><P>

PCs are capable of connection by means of modem cards and interface cards to
the PSTN, Local Area Networks and other computers by various means. The
connection of a PC to a network introduces additional threats to both the PC and,
in some instances, the network. Although the chapter on Networks and
Communications covers this topic in depth, this section considers the subject in
the context of personal computers.<P>

<H4>5.5.1 Public netvork access</H4><P>

In general communication sessions controlled externally to the PC from the public
network should be avoided. Where network access is unavoidable, strict controls
should be applied.<P>

<H4>5.5.2 Use of PC as a computer terminal</H4><P>

Most PCs are capable of emulating various types of terminal, either by the use of
sohware packages or the installation of an extension board. When used in this
mode the PC appears to the mainframe processor as if it were the appropriate
terminal type but it also retains the capabilities of a PC.
As a consequence of the above, three major threats to security arise as follows:<P>
<OL>
<LI>programmable interrogation,
<LI>storage playback capability,
<LI>bridging of communication capability to other systems.
</OL>
<H4>5.5.2.1 Interroga1ion and storage</H4><P>

Fixed mode (dumb) terminals can only interrogate and search authorised
transactions at a rate which is limited by the human operator. The results would
normally have to be transcribed from the VDU or printed on a slave printer. A PC,
on the other hand, could be programmed to carry out a range of interrogations,
examine the resultant responses and store the details of any transactions which
satisfy predetermined criteria.<P>

Once a procedure is established this exchange can take place at speeds which are
limited only by the speed of the communications interface and a great deal of
information could be sifted in a short period. When used legitimately this is
considered to be a authorised use of PC power. However the security of the
system may rely to some extent on the (perhaps limited) rate at which information
can be extracted.<P>

<H4>5.5.2.2 Connection to other systems</H4><P>

Suitably equipped PCs could connect to a mainframe computer and a public access
or BT-private network at the same time. Although the capability may seem
attractive to the PC user, the administrator of the mainframe computer might view
the potentially increased user community that may gain access to his system with
some trepidation. It could be the view that, if incorrectly managed, such a PC
could act as a switch or slave processor in order to connect the two. Thus an
unanticipated method of communication could be established which would allow
remote access from an unauthorised location and so constitute a breach of
security particularly if the PC were left on all day.<P>

Similar concerns might be raised if the PC were to be simultaneously connected to
two networks, for example, the PSTN and a BT internal network.<P>

It will be frequently both convenient and operationally legitimate to substitute a
PC for a terminal device in order to limit the items installed on the desk-top and to
streamline procedures. In recognition however of the risks to security, any
proposal to substitute a PC for a terminal device must have the approval of the
appropriate network or systems administration. They, in turn, must satisfy
themselves with regard to the additional risks which might arise as a consequence
of either enhanced interrogation or extended communication.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.9: PCs USED AS TERMINALS FOR SYSTEMS</H4><P>

A PC shall be used as a terminal for a BT system if, and only if, the use of a PC
has been permitted in the Security Policy Document of that system.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.10: PCs CONNECTED TO SYSTEMS</H4><P>

A PC shall not be connected to more than one system at a time unless approval
has been granted by the administrators of those systems.<P>

<H4>5.6 Contingency planning</H4><P>

The business is dependent for its functions on information of which a greater
amount is being stored and processed on PCs. There is now, therefore, a business
imperative to ensure that information on PCs is available when the business needs
it. PC users should evaluate the needs of the business process supported by
information on PCs, and ensure that these requirements can be met, even if there
is a computer or disk failure.<P>

Mistakes are made and machines can fail, either potentially leading to corruption
of data or software. Measures must be taken so that when corruption does occur,
service can be restored with the minimum of inconvenience and cost to the
business. The following are measures can be taken to reduce the impact of such a
failure.<P>

<H4>5.6.1 Archinng and backup</H4><P>

Data and/or software should periodically be copied to removable media for one of
several reasons:<P>
<UL>
<LI>in order to ensure that data is not lost in the event of a failure (BACKUP),
<LI>to free up the space occupied when the information is no longer required for
immediate access (ARCHIVE), or
<LI>because the information must be retained for some time to meet legal obligations
(ARCHIVE).
</UL>
The software and hardware products needed to achieve the above are usually
identical; only the strategy of their use changes. Neither a backup nor archive is of
any value unless it can be demonstrated that the information can be recovered
reliably.<P>

Data held on non-removable disks should be backed-up regularly, perhaps daily or
weekly depending on usage and criticality. The backup might be of the whole
system or only of those parts that have recently changed - an 'incremental backup'.
The copy should be stored either off-site or in a fire resistant cabinet, suitable for
its level of sensitivity.<P>

There are four methods by which archive or backup copies of a system can be
taken:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Utility software
Most PCs have a software facility on the system disk to back-up and restore files to
and from a floppy disk. The process is time consuming but there is no other cost
except that of the floppy disks used.

Note there are compatibility problems between differing versions of the DOS
BACKUP and RESTORE utility programs such that may it impossible to restore
files written using one version of BACKUP using a version of RESTORE from a
different vendor or different version of DOS. For this reason, it is advisable that a
copy of the RESTORE program is kept with the backup or archive.

<LI>Third-party archive software
Off the shelf software is available that enables files to be copied onto floppy disks
or a tape streamer. This software is often considerably faster than using the utility
software that came with the operating system, it is more flexible, and usually more
reliable. There is a small charge for this software.

<LI>Tape streamer
This is a separate item of equipment and often is supplied with the software to
drive it. Though the cost of a tape streamer is not insignificant, it can usually be
justified in the savings in time and floppy disks. Remember that a complete backup
of an 80% full 40Mb hard disk will use well over 30 720Kb floppies or in excess of
60 360Kb floppies. The task may take over an hour and is often used as the excuse
why a backup was not taken after the disk crashed!<BR>

A tape streamer is essential equipment where several users share a file-server on a
LAN. The capital cost can be spread amongst all of the LAN users, and all user
files can be copied at once.

<LI>External disk drives
External disk drives are available for many machines and can be used as a means
of archiving. Though fast, they are sometimes neither rugged nor particularly
economical. Iis situation may change with the introduction of high capacity
floppy disk drives.
</OL>
Should any of the information copied for backup or archive purposes be in
encrypted form, it is prudent to retain a copy of the cryptographic key so that the
information can be recovered. The cryptographic key should be kept securely
because it may be used to gain access to both the backup/archive and the original
information still on the PC.<P>

<H4>5.7 File Servers</H4><P>

File Servers on Local Area Networks pose similar security problems to PCs, due
to the fact that they are often sited in open plan offices, are small and are
accessible by many people. If privacy marked information is held on a LAN server
then precautions must be taken to safeguard that data.<P>

<H4>POLICY 5.11: FILE SERVER SECURlTY</H4><P>

File servers shall be protected in accordance with the sensitivity of the
information they contain, either through physical access controls, or through
logical controls. Policies 4.6 and 5.3 refer.<P>
