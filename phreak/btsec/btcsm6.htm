<H4>6.1 Introduction</H4><P>

The Computer Misuse Act 1990, has been in force in the United Kingdom since
August. This law makes the unauthorised access to, and misuse of computer
facilities a criminal offence.<P>

No amount of legislation will actually prevent unauthorised access and misuse of
facilities. This chapter offers guidance on methods that may be employed to
reduce or eliminate unauthorised access.<P>

Access to computers by users, in contrast to system operators and maintainers will
normally be via a terminal device. It can vary from a simple Visual Display Unit
(VDU), a sophisticated Personal Computer (PC), or a workstation. In order to
regulate access, it is essential that controls are exercised which are capable of
identifying both the source and origin of each session.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.1: COMPUTER MISUSE ACT 1990</H4><P>

It is a criminal offence for an unauthorised person to attempt to access systems
or information within systems, or to attempt to exceed the computer facilities
and privileges granted to them. Wherever possible, BTwill prosecute using the
Computer Misuse Act 1990.<P>

<H4>6.2 Regulating access to computers</H4><P>

Logical access control and associated audit trails and logs provide essential
deterrents against abuse of privilege by authorised system users.<P>

The unauthorised testing of the security controls of an operational system is
expressly forbidden.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.2: OPERATIONAL SYSTEM PENETRATION TESTING</H4><P>

The testing of the security controls of an operational system shall only be done
under strictly controlled conditions. All testing shall be carried out in
accordance with a written schedule. Prior approval of the Director of Security
and Investigation shall be obtained.<P>

<H4>6.2.1 Identification and authorisation principles</H4><P>

To prevent unauthorised individuals attempting to access computer systems,
identification and authentication controls of users are necessary. The most
common practice is to use identifiers and passwords when logging onto the
computer system. Other methods such as keys, badges, and smart cards can also
be used effectively. Other techniques are possible (for example,
challenge-response systems) using some form of personal token. Specialist advice
should be sought on the security characteristics of proposed systems prior to their
adoption.<P>

<H4>6.2.2 Logical access control packages</H4><P>

For some major operating systems, special purpose access control packages are
available. These provide degrees of protection by ensuring that all users are
positively identified and only granted access to the system resources and files for
which they have previously been authorised.<P>

The packages frequently complement the standard operating system by exploiting
hooks or by the replacement of standard routines and log details of all accesses for
later analysis. They may or may not identify that the data has been seen or
changed.<P>

Before implementing any security enhancement package it should be thoroughly
evaluated to ensure it meets the operational requirement.<P>

<h4>6.2.3 Siting of terminals</H4><P>

Terminal devices must be sited so that they cannot be easily overlooked by
unauthorised individuals. This is especially important when it is necessary to site
terminals in reception areas, telephone shops or other public places. Customer
information displayed on a screen which can be overlooked by the public or even
unauthorised employees potentially constitutes a breach of Data Protection
Legislation, Section 45 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, and the Code of
Practice on Disclosure of Customer Information. The inadvertent disclosure of
logon details may also result.<P>

When it is operationally necessary to site a terminal in a public area, it must be
screened so that it can only be viewed by authorised employees. If this is not
practical then serious consideration must be given to the benefits derived weighed
against the possible risk of irregular divulgence of information displayed on the
screen.<P>

The communication links for terminals in public places should be adequately
protected from the threat of tampering and rerouting.<P>

<H4>POLICY 63: SITING OF REMOTE TERMINAL</H4><P>

Terminals in public view but not for public access shall be sited carefully, and
particular attention shall be given to their physical security and
communications links.<P>

<H4>6.2.4 Intelligent terminals</H4><P>

Special care must be taken if ever a 'dumb' terminal is replaced by one with local
processing power, for example, a personal computer. Iis subject is covered in
detail in the chapter on Personal Computers.<P>

<H4>6.3 Identification</H4><P>

Identifiers are used to keep track of, and control the use of system resources.
Users and terminals may both have identifiers which can be used for the purposes
of auditing.<P>

<H4>6.3.1 User identification</H4><P>

Each user of a computer system should have an exclusive user identification
(UID).<P>
<UL>
<LI>UIDs are used to uniquely identify users and their associated characteristics
(access rights, capabilities, time based access and control privileges) to permit the
correct allocation of resources,

<LI>UIDs provide a means of recording system usage

<LI>UIDs should be allocated to individual users to permit unambiguous identification
in the interests of accountability. They should not be shared among groups of
individuals and may be constant as long as the user is authorised on the system

<LI>UIDs are not usually confidential (indeed in some systems users can obtain lists of
UIDs) and security must never depend solely on the user's ability to provide a
valid UID.
</UL>
<H4>POLICY 6.4: UNIQUE USER IDENTIFIER</H4><P>

Each user of a multi-user system shall be uniquely identifiable to that system.<P>

A network of computers that allows remote processes access to information on
any of the networked computers must also maintain unique user identification
for users, unless other means of security are implemented, for example by
disabling the facility for cross-machine recognition of UIDs. Separate UID
naming strategies for each machine can greatly assist in ensuring uniqueness.<P>

<H4>6.3.2 Terminal identification</H4><P>

Each terminal authorised to access the system may also have a Terminal
Identification (TID) built into it which is automatically communicated to the host
during log on. The system may then check that an attempted access comes from a
bona fide source at the correct physical location, and by comparing the signalled
TID with the UID of the user, may confirm an appropriate match.
TIDs should not be implemented alone since this does not assist accountability.
Moreover as a security measure they are rather limited. It is difficult to engineer
an unmodifiable TID into a terminal and TIDs may also become known in which
case they can be simulated.<P>

Terminal identification can also be by means of physical access controls such as
locks or removable badges and keys. In this case a code may be transmitted
automatically by the terminal over the communications link at the beginning of
every message. Any badges or keys must be removed when the terminal is not in
use and securely stored.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.5: TERMINAL IDENTIFERS IN A NETWORK</H4><P>

In the design of systems, the use of terminal identities shall be considered
where technically feasible.<P>

On some systems, source identification uniquely identifying the device and user,
for example, based on Kerberos, can be implemented. These systems provide a
very secure mechanism for forming a closed network of systems and users.<P>

<H4>6.4 Passwords</H4><P>

The knowledge of a password is sometimes used as corroborating evidence that
the accessor is entitled to the facilities associated with a particular UID.
Passwords must be allocated on an individual basis and not be shared.<P>

<H4>6.4.1 Password management</H4><P>

To afford reasonable protection against unauthorised access, passwords should be
a minimum of six characters long, with at least one non-alphabetic. Passwords
used for system privileges should contain at least eight characters. It is desirable
that the system software should check for too simple a combination such as all the
same characters. There is an advantage in allowing a range of password lengths
(down to the prescribed minimum) since this makes searching by adversaries
harder.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.6: PASSWORD MANAGEMENT</H4><P>

Passwords to systems shall be properly managed so that:<P>
<UL>
<LI>They are not easily guessable,

<LI>They are changed at least every 90 days,

<LI>They are at least 6 characters long for user access and at least 8 for system
privilege access,

<LI>Preferably they consist of all the possible character set,

<LI>They contain at least one non-alphabetical character,

<LI>They cannot be easily changed back to previously used passwords,

<LI>They cannot be easily exhaustively searched (unless denial of service is a
threat),

<LI>They are not echoed to screens or paper,

<LI>They are not written down, except if treated with appropriate security levels to
protect their confidentiality, integrity and accountability, and where there is a
valid business reason

<LI>Not related to the UID,

<LI>They are not related to the identity of the user.
</UL>
<H4>6.4.2 Password selection</H4><P>

Users should be permitted to select their own passwords since these are more
easily remembered but users must be warned against guessable or predictable
values. The system should check that all passwords are not one of the 'standard'
or guessable words that an adversary would try, for example, password the same
as the UID.<P>

Meaningful terms such as SYS or SYSTEM, initials, Christian names, car
registration numbers and the names of spouses are all popular choices for
password and are worthless from a security viewpoint, as are certain popular
words such as FRED.<P>

The more common or computer-relevant meaningful words of the English
language are also to be avoided. There are surprisingly few of them - perhaps only
4000, and many cases exist of hackers breaking a system by simply trying a few
hundred of the most likely words one after another.<P>

Password strength is greatly enhanced by the selection of non-meaningful
character combinations. An adversary is far less likely to guess a password such as
XAC/9 than ANDREW although initial memorisation may be more difficult.<P>

<H4>6.4.3 System passwords</H4><P>

An extra level of security is obtained if users are required to enter a system
password prior to and as well as their own selected application password. System
passwords provide the additional facility of rapid lock-out of groups of users if
need be.<P>

System passwords must never be used as a substitute for personal passwords.
They must be chosen in line with the password generation guidelines and be
controlled by the systems administrator.<P>

<H4>6.4.4 Password secrecy</H4><P>

Users must be properly briefed on the importance of the correct use of passwords
and that they have a responsibility to safeguard them.<P>

All passwords should be assumed to be as valuable as the system or information to
which it can be used to gain access. If the password is written down, the text
should be protected accordingly. A password should not be disclosed to others
nor should it ever be entered at a terminal when others are in a position to watch
so closely as to deduce the password.<P>

When a password is used to gain access to a system or entered for the purposes of
password change, the password text must be obscured either by overprinting, in
the case of hardcopy local echo terminals, or the echo suppressed where
full-duplex communications are used between the terminal and the host.<P>

<H4>6.4.5 Dual passwords</H4><P>

Under some circumstances, business transactions might be so important that no
one individual may be permitted to initiate the transaction by themselves. If these
transactions are actually carried out by computer then a way must be found to
ensure that two people are present to 'authorise' the transaction and be
responsible for it. One approach is to ensure that system accounts that have the
privilege to initiate such transactions need two passwords to access them. An
alternative approach might be to have one long password formed by the
concatenation of two shorter passwords. Other schemes could be devised.<P>

<H4>6.4.6 Preprogramming of passwords</H4><P>

Storage of preprogrammed passwords or entire logon sequences on intelligent
terminals or function keys or stored files is extremely dangerous practice and is
forbidden unless the circumstances have been agreed by the Director of Security
and Investigation. Any brief unauthorised access to the terminal or stored data will
then permit the password to be compromised.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.8: PREPROGRAMMING OF PASSWORDS</H4><P>

The automation of entire logon sequences is expressly forbidden except with
the permission of the Director of Security and Investigation.<P>

<H4>6.4.7 Computer storage of passwords</H4><P>

Users' passwords should be under their own control and should not be available
from the system to anybody else including operational or maintenance staff.<P>

To this end it is highly desirable that the computer logon procedures use one-way
encrypted password files. This means that passwords are stored in irreversibly
encrypted form within the computer.<P>

Passwords entered by users at logon are encrypted using the same algorithm, and
the two encrypted forms are checked for a match to prove authentication.<P>

The encryption algorithm must however be strong and guidance must be sought
from The Director of Security and Investigations, since some password encryption
systems have been found to be very weak indeed.<P>

<H4>6.4.8 Password change</H4><P>

The system should ensure that all passwords (individual and system) are changed
regularly. Passwords should be changed at least every 90 days.
Password change may be enforced by:<P>
<UL>
<LI>forcing users to change their passwords after a given period, or
<LI>allowing users to change their passwords at will ess desirable since less reliable),
<LI>or preferably both.
</UL>
The change of existing passwords should involve a verification of the user's
identity on the basis of the existing password and double entry of the proposed
new password as a check against input errors. The system should not permit an
old password to be used again until at least a certain number of different new
passwords have been registered.<P>

Where forced password change is not implemented the system should record the
date of last change to permit identification of users not complying with security
requirements. If there is a possibility that a password has been compromised, it
must be changed immediately.<P>

<H4>6.4.9 Administrator control of passwords</H4><P>

It should be possible for the system administrator to force a user's password to a
value of the administrator's choosing in the event that a user genuinely forgets his
or her password. However neither the administrator nor anybody else should be
able to obtain the value of a current password from the computer.<P>

As an alternative, stronger security is obtained (at slightly greater administrative
cost) if password forcing is simply not allowed. In this case forgetting a password
compels full reauthorisation.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.21: UID EXPIRY</H4><P>

When a UID remains unused for greater than 60 days, it shall be disabled.<P>

<H4>6.4.10 Manufacturer's installed UIDs and passwords</H4><P>

Manufacturer's installed UIDs and passwords present at equipment and software
delivery must be changed to user-selected values as soon as practicable since the
manufacturer's choice of values may be standard and well known.<P>

It is also essential that passwords are changed after every visit by the
manufacturer or computer servicing agency to remove the danger of passwords
becoming known to contractors. Care must be taken when the system is reloaded
and upgraded that any manufacturers passwords are not reinstated.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.9: MANUFACTURERS PASSWORDS</H4><P>

Manufacturer installed passwords shall be removed and replaced with new
passwords in operational systems.<P>

<H4>6.4.11 Sofware maintenance by third parties</H4><P>

Systems requiring access for software maintenance by non-BT personnel should
not permit total system software and data file eedom to the contractor.
Maintenance should only be possible at agreed times and under BT supervision.
Sensitive data should, if necessary, be removed from the system prior to
maintenance.<P>

Some computer vendors encourage remote access to their customers computer
systems via the PSTN for the purposes of fault diagnosis. If this option is taken,
access must be very strictly controlled since large quantities of information could
easily be made available, perhaps by means of uncontrolled software dumps.
Access to the system should be controlled manually, for example using a port
configured for outward dialled calls only with incoming calls barred. Special care
must be taken to change passwords after maintenance sessions by contractors.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.10: REMOTE ACCES FOR MAINTENANCE PURPOSES</H4><P>

Remote access for diagnostic or preventative maintenance purposes shall be
strictly controlled so as to protect the security of the system.<P>

<H4>6.4.12 Password transmission</H4><P>

Passwords used to protect information of a given sensitivity must be afforded at
least the same protection and preferably a higher level of protection than the
information and processes to which they give access. This is particularly important
when accessing a system remotely across a public network. Distribution of
passwords must be done in a way which ensures that disclosure en route would
not result in a compromise of the system on which the password would be used. In
particular, electronic mail systems must not be used for distribution of passwords.<P>

<H4>6.5 Limitations of password security</H4><P>

Most experts no longer regard traditional password practices as fully secure. This
section outlines their limitations and indicates favoured methods of enhancing
security<P>

<H4>6.5.1 Weaknesses</H4><P>

The advice concerning minimum password length, secrecy and frequency of
change should be viewed as the minimum requirements. Unless users are
strongly encouraged (or forced) to employ highly random passwords they will
tend only to select passwords from a total of about 4000 English words.<P>

Even if passwords are highly random the fact that they are used more than once
represents a security weakness since any person obtaining a password value (by
line tapping, by watching the operator key in the value, by finding a written
copy...) can then penetrate the system freely until that password is changed.<P>

These weaknesses can be overcome by both using truly random passwords, and
changing passwords every access.<P>

<H4>6.5.2 Random one-time passwords</H4><P>

This can be achieved by adopting one-time password procedures whereby each
user is given a list of random password values which must be used once only each
and in the given order. However, this would involve writing down passwords
which is contrary to good practice.<P>

In certain systems, the distribution of such lists may be acceptable, but generally
the challenge system of the next paragraph is to be preferred.<P>

<H4>6.5.3 Challenge systems</H4><P>

In a challenge system, random one-time passwords are obtained by providing
each user with a Personal Identification Unit (PIU) usually resembling a pocket
calculator. On attempted access with a valid UID, the host generates a random
number or challenge value which it sends to the user. The user must then enter
the value manually on their PIU. The PIU then performs a complex mathematical
operation on this number and displays the result on its display. The user then
transcribes this number to the terminal which, in turn, is sent to the host for
checking. If the check is successful, the host can be reasonable certain that the
user has the correct PIU in his possession and access can be granted.<P>

Each PIU should use a different cryptographic key to permit identification of an
individual user. The PIU will work correctly only in conjunction with its associated
UID. Attempts to use the PIU with an alternative or incorrect UID will result in an
incorrect response being generated. To prevent unauthorised system access
should a PIU fall into the wrong hands the user may also be required to enter a
secret Personal Identification Number (PIN) into the PIU prior to keying in the
challenge value.<P>

The access thus depends on something:<P>
<UL>
<LI>possessed by the user (the PIU), and

<LI>known by the user (the PIN).
</UL>
The algorithm should be cryptographically strong so as to prevent analysis of the
method by an adversary.<P>

Alternative types of PIU, which generate a new one-time password every minute or
so, obviate the need for a challenge-response sequence, are also available.
Biometric devices are becoming more commercially available and are worthy of
consideration for sensitive systems, they are however rather costly for widespread
use.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.11: USER AUTHENTICATION DEVICES</H4><P>

In the design of systems, the use of user authentication devices should be
considered and documented.<P>

<H4>6.6 Logging on</H4><P>

No user should be able to log onto a system containing high integrity,
commercially sensitive, or privacy marked information without first executing a
security dialogue, such as a correct entry of a valid UID and matching password
(or equivalent). This ensures full identification and authentication and permits
logging for subsequent accountability.<P>

<H4>6.6.1 Welcome screens</H4><P>

The initial screen (traditionally called the "Welcome" screen) displayed before
successful completion of the security dialogue should be designed to reveal the
minimum amount of information about the system.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.12: WELCOME SCREENS</H4><P>

Text displayed before logon shall provide only the minimum amount of
information for access authorisation.<P>

<H4>6.6.2 Silent log on</H4><P>

No system facilities, not even the 'HELP' command, should be available to the
user prior to successful completion of these steps. Security is appreciably
enhanced by adopting log on procedures which give no help to potential
adversaries.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.13: SILENT LOGON</H4><P>

Other than a minimal prompt for user ID and password, no additional help shall
be given when logging on to BT multi-user, administration or management
systems. Failure of a logon sequence shall not identify which part of the logon
process failed.<P>

<H4>6.6.3 Log on security</H4><P>

The logon procedure should be fully secure. No trap-door method shall be
possible by, for example, through use of zero-length, excessive length UIDs or
passwords, or by control, escape or break signals.<P>

<H4>6.6.4 Prescribed warning screen</H4><P>

As soon as access has been successfully achieved, the following screen should be
displayed by all BT multi-user, administration and management systems
processing high integrity, commercially sensitive, or privacy-marked material.<P>

</PRE>
<H4>POLlCY 6.14: PRESCRIBED WARNING SCREEN AND AUTHORISATION</H4><P>

A prescribed warning screen shall be displayed immediately after an accessor
successfully completes the logon sequence. The system administrator shall set
up procedures to provide written authorisation to users stating their access
privileges.<P>

<H4>6.6.5 Log on failure conditions</H4><P>
Logon must not be permitted if:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the UID is invalid,
<LI>the UID is barred,
<LI>the password is invalid,
<LI>the UID and password combination is invalid,
<LI>the claimed UID is already active unless it is a system requirement,
<LI>the logon would contravene local policy, for example, time of day restrictions.
</UL>
<H4>6.6.6 Repeated log on attempts</H4><P>

The rate at which an adversary can make log on attempts must be limited to
prevent exhaustive searching of UID and password combinations.
Such an attack can be rendered imoractical bv compelling:<P>
<UL>
<LI>a modest time delay (eg. two seconds) between each individual access attempt
made on any given port, and
<LI>a substantial time delay (eg. one minute) every few attempts (eg. three).
</UL>
This may be accomplished by including an attempt counter in the log on
procedure such that no more than three attempts may be made subject only to the
modest time delay, after which attempts from that port are disabled for a
substantial time delay. The preferred option is that the link is actually
disconnected and the user compelled to obtain reconnection.<P>

A stronger measure would be to permanently disable the UID or port with
appropriate messages being sent to system log and the system administrator. In
such cases the UIDs should be taken out of service automatically after a
predefined number of consecutive unsuccessful access attempts - perhaps three.
Before the locked-out UID can be used again, an approach has to be made to the
Systems Administrator who will decide, if necessary in consultation with the
Application Manager, whether to reactivate the original UID or issue a new one.
This strategy is recommended for consideration only for High Impact Systems
because an adversary may abuse the feature to disable all UID and/or ports
causing a 'Denial of Service' problem. The running of verification utilities against
system critical commands should be considered prior to reinstatement of the UID.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.15: TERMINAL OR UID LOCKOUT</H4><P>

When a terminal or UID is repeatedly misused in an attempt to breach a
system, the terminal or UID shall be disabled and an alarm given. The period
during which the terminal or UID is disabled must be commensurate with the
impact of Denial of Service.<P>

<H4>6.6.7 Recording access attempts</H4><P>

Where possible all access attempts (whether or not successful and whether or not
exceeding the counter limit) should be recorded on the system log. Alarms to the
system manager may also be raised in real-time depending on the sensitivity of the
system following repeated logon failures. The record should indicate the
attempted UID, the time of the event and the link involved but should not record
the attempted passwords.<P>

Exceptional events (such as apparent exhaustive trialling of password on a
particular UID) should be so recorded as to come rapidly to the attention of
supervisory personnel. The log must be scrutinised at frequent intervals for any
evidence of unauthorised access attempts. Any unusual logged events must be
investigated.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.16: SECURE ALARMS</H4><P>

Security alarms shall be used to inform the system administrator when an
attempted breach of security has been detected.<P>

<H4>6.6.8 Last access</H4><P>
On successful logon the user should be informed of the time and date of last
access, and of any unsuccessful access attempts since then.<P>

<H4>6.6.9 Unauthorised access</H4><P>

Any (suspected or known) unauthorised access attempt or criminal activity should
be reported immediately to the BT Investigation Department Help Desk and line
management. Further investigatory action should await specialist advice from
BTID.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.8: REPORTING OF SECURITY INCIDENTS applies.</H4><P>

<H4>6.7 Logging off</H4>

<H4>6.7.1 Terminal inactinty</H4><P>

The system should include an activity sensing feature to identify terminals which,
although logged on, appear to have been abandoned. These are a security risk
since an adversary finding such a terminal unattended could employ it with all the
access rights of the previous user. If no input is detected after a certain timeout
(eg. five minutes) the system should log the terminal off automatically.<P>

This may be undesirable for some very limited facilities, such as batch processing
or program development, in which case longer timeouts may be associated with
specific UIDs.<P>

PCs should have approved security programs installed on them such that, if no
user activity has been detected for a period of time, the program will lock the PC
terminal and require a password entry to be reactivated. is must be done
especially for PCs logged into a server system. Such programs should also blank
out the actual contents of the display (it may be replaced by some other display)
until the PC has been reactivated through the password. Screen blanking options
that only jumble the contents of the screen should not be used. Preferably, the
blanking of data should be combined with a screen saver function, which reduces
the display duty cycle significantly, to help prolong the life of the display.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.17: TERMINAL OR UID TIMEOUT</H4><P>

When a port or UID remains dormant for a period of time, it shall be disabled.
Terminal timeout shall also occur when a terminal remains logged onto a
system, but remains unused for a period of time. The screen shall be cleared of
any display when the forced logoff occurs.<P>

<H4>6.7.2 Prolonged activity</H4><P>

The system should require users present on the system for prolonged periods
(hours rather than days) to reenter their log on sequence (UID and password) .
This is to ensure that the authorised user is still present and that the
communication link has not been hijacked by an adversary.<P>

<H4>6.7.3 Link interruption</H4><P>

The system should similarly automatically log off and clear down completely and
immediately the session with any terminal whose communications path is
interrupted. Many terrninals have a carrier detection light to show at the
communications path is open and the failure of this may indicate an interruption.

<H4>POLICY 6.18: LOG OFF WHEN COMMUNICATION SESSION IS
INTERRUPTED</H4><P>

Precautions shall be taken during the design of systems to ensure that active
sessions are aborted if a failure in communications occurs.<P>

<H4>6.8 User privileges</H4><P>

It is usually a requirement that user capabilities still be restricted after log on. This
is to prevent unauthorised use of computer facilities and unauthorised access of
system software and data to which the user is not entitled. It is generally
accomplished by establishing a set of 'privileges' associated with each UID such
that users are not permitted to perform functions or access data except as
indicated in their privilege tables. Controls shall ensure this by such means as
password controls, access control lists, labelling of data fields.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.19: DATA ACCESS CONTROLS</H4><P>

Processing capability and data shall be accessible only by authorised staff with
the appropriate privileges.<P>

<H4>6.8.1 Privilege table establishment</H4><P>

The default condition of all privilege tables should be that corresponding to no
privileges. Privilege tables must be under the ultimate control of user
management who must authorise all changes.<P>

<H4>6.8.2 Facility privileges</H4><P>
Privileges speciing the computer facilities available to users should be controlled
only by system administrator staff. Facility privileges include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>I/O device allocations,
<LI>available storage volume,
<LI>maximum job size,
<LI>financial budget and its consumption.
</UL>
This restriction must be applied with particular rigour to security privileges. It
must not be possible under any circumstances for an ordinary user to redefine
himself as a system operator or system administrator for example or obtain access
to their data files or facilities or obtain access to security-related software such as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>operating systems,
<LI>password control software,
<LI>system log software,
<LI>access control software,
<LI>time restrictions.
</UL>
Where a job consists of several tasks run in sequence, the authority of the user
should be checked at each task and not solely on the first one.<P>

Staff whose job is to run a limited set of programs should not have the facility to
edit, read or write programs. Menu-driven software may be helpful to ensure this.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.20: ADMINISTRATION OF PRIVILEGES</H4><P>

Privileges shall be administered only by the system administrator (or
equivalent role) .<P>

<H4>6.8.3 Function privileges</H4><P>

Privileges defining the computer functions available to users should also be
controlled by system administration staff only. Procedures for the replication of
user privileges should only allow the minimum to be created appropriate with the
users authority. Users should only be permitted to use those commands required
in the normal course of their duties.<P>

<H4>6.9 Access to user files</H4><P>

Privileges defining the rights of users to access each other's data files may be
exclusively under system administrator control, especially on high risk systems.
However, on less sensitive systems discretionary control is frequently all that is
required whereby each user controls the access of others to his own data files. In
general systems developers should not have access to live files.<P>

<H4>6.9.1 Implementation of logical access controls</H4><P>

In this context 'access' may imply any of a number of operations (eg read, write,
delete, modify, execute...) and it is essential that each of these should be
separately specifiable. In any case there is implied the creation of a more or less
detailed set of access restrictions for each user data file and the existence of
special system control software for enforcement.<P>

There may also be a need for user identification control within applications, for
example to test for the maintenance of separation of duties.<P>

Software development tools, for example, compilers, program libraries, source
code etc, should not be available on operational systems. If they are present, their
use must be strictly controlled.<P>

It is important that as much as possible of the control procedure should be
performed automatically by the system and in a 'user friendly' and efficient
manner. User acceptance and co-operation cannot be obtained otherwise and the
security system will be viewed as an enemy by those it is intended to serve with
the result that users will tend to avoid and circumvent its protective measures
where possible.<P>

Most Operating Systems implement some form of access control but the degree of
real security obtained varies dramatically from one system to another.<P>

<H4>6.9.2 Default privileges</H4><P>

The preferable default privilege is that no user other than the file owner can
access (read, write, etc.) any given file unless given explicit authority to do so by
the owner.<P>

<H4>6.9.3 Password control of file access</H4><P>

A limited degree of control may be obtained by password protection of files such
that access is only available to users who know the correct password. Separate
control of the different types of access (read, write, etc.) is then not generally
possible, and the overall degree of security is much poorer than the fully
specifiable, fully managed systems indicated above.<P>

This is partly because of user reluctance to undertake the burden of the additional
passwords especially when all the issues concerning randomness and regular
change of password are taken into account.<P>

<H4>6.9.4 Encryption of files</H4><P>

Files may also be encrypted by users to obtain a degree of protection rather
higher than password control since simple access to the file no longer yields
useful information.<P>

<H4>6.10 Customer access to BT computers</H4><P>

As communications technology becomes more and more sophisticated, and
external companies become more demanding in the flexibility and management of
the BT services which they use, BT is required to offer management and
administrative services to its customers. The risks associated with this are well
known and understood within the security community. However, systems
implementors and administrators are not always aware of these. Systems which
provide customer access are vulnerable in a number of areas, specifically the risk
of access to system facilities which are beyond their anticipated privilege profile.
Ihis can lead to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Compromise of the BT system
<LI>Compromise of connected networked systems
<LI>Compromise of other customers data
</UL>
Where customers are given access to a BT system, the system must be designed
in a way that separates the customer access facility from the system's internal BT
facilities. Where access to the system is initially regulated by the standard
operating system User ID/password system, access to the internal BT facilities
must be via a strong authentication method, preferably based upon a token or
one-time password system.<P>

Customers place a high degree of trust in the service BT provides. It is the
responsibility of systems implementors to consider the impact of failure upon a
customer. Depending upon the risks it may be beneficial to provide access upon
strong authentication techniques.<P>

When customers are given access to BT Service Management Systems, used by
other customers, or holding sensitive information about other customers,
processes or contracts undertaken by BT, then the Service Management System
shall be considered to be a "high impact" system and subject to accreditation by
the Director of Security and Investigation. (See section 2.8)<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.21: SENSlTIVllY OF SYSTEMS WlTH CUSTOMER ACCESS</H4><P>

Systems providing customer access are deemed to be HIGH IMPACT systems
where there is a connection between that system and other BT systems.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.22- AUIHENTFICATION ON SYSTEMS VVlTH CUSIOMER
ACCESS</H4><P>

Access to non-customer facilities on a system providing customer access shall
be via strong authentication methods.<P>

<H4>6.11 Contractors</H4>

<H4>6.11.1 Software development by third parties</H4>

Development of applications for BT by external companies should adhere to the
same standards of development practice that we expect of internal developments.
The quality assurance of the system is a crucial issue, particularly for systems
which are of an operational or mission critical nature. Assurance standards should
be quoted in terms of the Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria
(ISEC) levels, which should be specified at the start of the project.<P>

There are greater risks associated with software produced by external companies,
where the level of direct BT supervision is likely to be minimal. The introduction
of Trojan horse code is not easy to detect without extensive analysis of the
program code.<P>

On-line systems need to be afforded protection from development people, and
segregation of roles is a key element of this. Development contractors need to be
separated from live environments.<P>

Default access to live data is not permitted. Access to live data in support of the
contract should be for specific activities and must be monitored. Access must be
withdrawn immediately following completion of the activity, or between phases of
it.<P>

<H4>POLICY 6.23: CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO DATA</H4><P>

Third Party Contractors used for development of systems shall not have direct
access to on-line BT systems or live data, unless such facilities are absolutely
necessary for execution of the contract. In this case, the contract shall specify
the security requirements to protect BT's information.<P>

<H4>Operational activies by third parties</H4><P>

BT has used outside contractors and agents for carrying out work for many years.
Examples of this are building maintenance and other non-communications related
activities. Increasingly, activities are being transferred to outside specialists.
However, over the last decade, almost all of our activities and functions have been
computerised and have become highly integrated with other systems. Therefore,
outsourcing of an activity has to be viewed against the threats to BT as a whole
from such a scheme.<P>

<H4>POLlCY 6.24: OUTSOURCING</H4><P>

Proposals to outsource a process, to be carried out without direct BT
supervision off BT premises, and which requires electronic access to BT
information, must be supported by a Security Policy Document. If the process
involves on-line access to a BT system processing information at Sensitivity
level 2 or higher, the system must be accredited in accordance with Policy 2.7<P>
