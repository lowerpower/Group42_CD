<HR>
<H4>7.1 Introduction</H4><P>

It is a security objective that software and data are correct complete and available
to authorised users. Full use should be made of the security features provided by
the operating system to achieve this objective. If software needs to be written,
security and audit requirements should be considered at the system design stage.
Users must ensure that the Statement of Requirements document contains a
definition of security requirements and access restrictions.<P>

<H4>7.2 Software installation and maintenance</H4><P>

<H4>7.2.1 Software changes</H4><P>

All software modifications to a computer system must be authorised and fully
recorded. The modification log should be held by the system administrator.
Emergency patches (those that are not scheduled) must be properly documented
and reviewed by the appropriate authority within one working day.<P>

Checks should be implemented to ensure that only one change is carried out at a
time. If development pressure compels the packaging of changes in order to
minimise the system testing overheads, the checking must be even more vigilant.<P>

Expert personnel should check all new and modified software for correctness and
completeness with special regard to the possibility of security flaws. It should also
be verified to ensure that it functions according to design, that it does not
adversely affect other functions in the system and that no unauthorised changes
have been made to the system. These checks should be conducted on an off-line
system and not on operational machines.<P>

Verification should be performed after all software changes and on a regular basis.<P>

While full verification testing of the type outlined above is not always possible due
to operational constraints, use of unverified software provided by a third party
represents an unknown quantity from a security viewpoint, especially in cases
where the source code is not available. In any case assurances must be obtained
from the supplier about the integrity of the software and especially about the
removal of undeclared commands incorporated for debugging purposes.<P>

It is preferable that user software should be written in a high level language. Only
compiled programs should be released. Source code should only be available to
the programmer creating or amending the program or for the verification of the
validity of any changes; this applies equally to operational Job Control Language
text. Job Control Language which cannot be compiled should be held in a discrete
library store with controlled access.<P>

<H4>7.2.2 Protection of production systems</H4><P>

Ideally the software development cycle should involve a separation of
Development, Test and Production environments. These three areas often have
quite different security requirements. As far as technical restraints and costs
permit, they should be isolated from each other. Technical and procedural<P>

controls should be applied to the promotion of software from Development to Test
and from Test to Production environments. Special care should be taken to protect
the integrity of code accepted into Production use.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.1: VERSION CONTROL OF SOFTWARE</H4><P>

Software shall be subject to version control to ensure that only current and
approved software is in use on an electronic system.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.2: PROTECTION OF DATA IN SYSTEM TESTING</H4><P>

Live data shall not be used in system testing. Test data derived from, and
traceable to, live data shall be afforded a similar level of protection to the
original source.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.3: SOFTWARE OF UNKNOWN INTEGRlTY</H4><P>

Unless a trustworthy method has been used to create and distribute software
then the integrity of the software shall be considered to be unknown and shall
not be used on BT systems.

<H4>POLICY 7.4: LIMITED USE OF DEVELOPMENTAND MAINTENANCE
SOFTVVARE</H4><P>

Software that can be used to modify existing programs on systems (such as
editors and compilers) shall be restricted in their use to authorised staff. Any
such software that is not needed for operational reasons shall be removed.

<H4>POLICY 7.5: EMERGENCY ACCESS TO PRODUCTION SYSTEMS</H4><P>

Emergency access to Production systems, using powerful utilities, for the
purpose of data repair shall be subject to rigorous change control and every
access of this nature must be recorded.<P>

<H4>7.2.3 Softvare copyright</H4><P>

The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 expressly accords computer
programs the same copyright protection as written documentation. When BT
owns the copyright in a computer program because it was written in-house or
under a contract assigning copyright to BT, it is BT policy to mark the program
appropriately. Details on how to mark information are contained within the
Information Security Code.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.6: COPYRIGHT OF BT SOFTWARE</H4><P>

All software written in BT, or written for BT under a contract which provides for
ownership of copyright by BT, shall be clearly marked so as to identify BT as
the owner of copyright in such software.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.7: COPYRIGHT IN NON-BT SOFTWARE</H4><P>

Copyright law restrictions prohibiting the unauthorised copying, modification
or unlicensed use of software and software documentation, in which the
copyright is not owned by BT, shall be respected at all times.<P>

Unless BT has been granted an appropriate licence by the copyright owner,
software and software documentation in which the copyright is owned by anyone
other than BT, must not be copied, modified or used in BT. Where BT has a
licence, the terms of the licence, including any limitations on copying, modifying
or using such software and software documentation must be complied with at all
times. Copyright markings applied by the copyright owner must not be removed
(unless expressly permitted under the licence).<P>

<H4>7.2.4 System backup</H4><P>

Interruptions to normal working may be caused by such events as fires, hardware,
software or environmental failures and malicious damage.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.8: SYSTEM BACKUP</H4><P>

Copies of the current versions of the system software, data, and accompanying
documentation shall be safely stored and available so as to enable a quick and
controlled recovery in case of a processing interruption.<P>

<H4>7.2.5 Failures and recovery</H4><P>

All abnormal program terminations should be monitored by the system to permit
control to be passed to system recovery routines when necessary. Any software
failure must be documented and investigated as this may be an indication of a
breach in security.<P>

There should also be controls to ensure the validity of the software itself.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.9: RECOVERY FROM PROCESSING FAILURES</H4><P>

The planning of systems shall take into account the need to detect failures of
software and hardware and provide recovery features such that the integrity of
the data shall not be compromised.<P>

<H4>7.3 Log facilities and system data</H4><P>

System data is the information used by the operating system and application
software to control and monitor access to system resources by users. Logs kept by
the system form a large component of system data.<P>

<H4>7.3.1 Log facilities</H4><P>

A system log is required to identify users who have invoked transactions so as to
assign accountability. The logs should reflect both system performance and user
activity and each event on the system log should have an associated reference
number and be time-stamped.<P>

It is essential that log hard copy and log software, eg reporting programs for logs
held on disk or tape, should be afforded maximum protection from unauthorised
modification and should be unaffected by system restarts etc. Hard copy logs
should be kept for critical system logs. The pages of a hard copy log should be
pre-numbered so that it may readily be checked for completeness.<P>

<H4>7.3.2 Logging system activity</H4><P>

System activity should be recorded on the log to include matters such as:
<UL>
<LI>processing software errors,
<LI>program aborts,
<LI>crashes,
<LI>machine failures,
<LI>restarts
</UL>
together with information about causes.<P>

<H4>7.3.3 Logging user actinty</H4><P>
Monitoring user activity is especially dependent on the existence of a user activity
log and may be regarded as an audit trail for the detection of unauthorised activity
and identification of its origination. The user activity log should record such
events as the following and include for each record any relevant information such
as date, time, physical access point or port, UID, and nature of the attempt:<P>
<UL>
<LI>all system log on attempts (successful or unsuccessful),
<LI>all log off events,
<LI>all attempts by users to access system facilities outside their range of privilege,
<LI>all attempts by users to access data files belonging to other users in contravention
of system access controls,
<LI>all attempts by users to employ commands outside their range of privilege
<LI>all use of high level privilege.
</UL>
The log should particularly include all security-relevant events, that is, interaction
and attempted interaction with the security system such as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>password changes (although without logging password values)
<LI>access to restricted or critical system tables
<LI>modification of privilege lists
</UL>
<H4>POLICY 7.10: ELECTRONIC SYSTEM ACTIVlTY RECORDS</H4><P>

An audit log of the system activity shall be maintained and regularly reviewed
so as to identify abnormal system or user activity. Activity records shall be kept
of events on all High Impact Systems, particularly of any activity which might
be abnormal. Abnormal activity shall raise an alarm.<P>

<H4>7.3.4 Checking logs</H4><P>

While it may be impracticable to scrutinise an entire system log by hand, a regular
spot check must be made on random samples of the log and on periods of
unusually high logon activity, or access at abnormal hours. Project documentation
should give precise instructions regarding the checking of system logs.<P>

The use of a software tool to separate unusual log entries from routine and
non-contentious information which would enable a more careful scrutiny to be
made, should be considered. Specialist audit packages, data test equipment are
examples.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.11: CHECKING OF LOGS</H4><P>

System logs shall be regularly checked so as to detect unauthorised system
activity. The use of automated techniques shall be considered.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.12: CONTROL OF AUDIT TOOLS</H4><P>

The automated tools used to analyse the system log files shall be protected and
subject to management and control procedures.<P>

<H4>7.3.5 Retention of logs and journals</H4><P>

The length of the retention period should take into account audit and legal
requirements, error recovery and investigation of any unusual occurrences.<P>

<H4>7.3.6 Condition records</H4><P>

Hard copy logs of important system parameters, data modifications, and details
pertaining to hardware and software conditions, must be securely maintained by
the system administrator. Iis permits a comparison to the system state after
events such as software updates, fix or patch insertions and system restarts to
verify that no accidental or unauthorised changes have been made. Parameters to
be verified include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>billing options,
<LI>access control features,
<LI>user privilege profiles,
<LI>audit trails,
<LI>configuration management.
</UL>
This inforrnation can be used to provide legally submissable evidence concerning
the correctness of the system in the pursuance of Section 69 of the Police And
Criminal Evidence Act (1984).<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.13: LOGGING OF FAULT REPORTS</H4><P>

A log shall be kept of fault reports by users, and hardware and software
maintenance on systems.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.14: AUDlTS AND JOURNALS</H4><P>

All audit and journals of system activity shall be retained or archived for a
reasonable amount of time in the event that the information is required for
evidential purposes.<P>

<H4>7.3.7 Storage of logs in microfiche form</H4><P>

Special precautions must be taken to preserve the usefulness of logs as evidence if
they are processed onto microfiche. The people responsible for the operation of
the process and the subsequent storage must provide clear evidence that there
can have been no interference with the logs during the process, or with the
subsequent microfiche.<P>

<H4>7.3.8 Encryption of system data</H4><P>

Particularly sensitive files and data such as password listings should be given
extra protection by being encrypted by the system. Passwords in particular should
be one-way encrypted such that the original data cannot be recovered under any
circumstances.<P>

<H4>7.3.9 Back-up copies</H4><P>

A system backup must be taken by system management personnel at regular
intervals, the frequency of which will reflect the importance of the system and the
impact of a system failure. The backup data should be stored securely
o£ premises. Current copies of all on-site system images should be kept in
approved locked, fire-resistant cabinets.<P>

A definitive copy of important data files must be securely maintained and used by
system management to detect unauthorised changes to such things as access
control mechanisms, user rights profiles, backup controls and audit mechanisms.
Any file amendments must be logged.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.15: BACKUP OF SENSITIVE DATA</H4><P>

Sensitive information shall be backed up by a cycle of copies, devised so that
the system can be brought into service after any accidental or deliberate
erasure of data.<P>

<H4>7.4 Data sensitivity</H4><P>

Systems that perform security functions, or which safeguard commercially
sensitive information whereby the failure to protect the confidentiality, integrity,
availability of that information would cause:<P>
<UL>
<LI>a substantial loss to BT,
<LI>a substantial gain to a competitor,
<LI>severe embarrassment to BT,
<LI>serious loss of confidence in BT, or
<LI>a serious reduction of BT's standing in the community, or relationships generally,
</UL>
are called HIGH IMPACT SYSTEMS.<P>

<H4>7.4.1 Data ownership</H4><P>
Data ownership is an essential element in safeguarding BT's commercially
sensitive information. The Data Owner is responsible for identifying the value and
sensitivity of their data. This decision must be respected by all users and systems.
Ownership conveys both responsibility for, and authority to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>judge the value and importance of the information,
<LI>assign a sensitivity level,
<LI>specify operational controls and permitted uses,
<LI>communicate control and protection requirements to users and custodians.
</UL>
<H4>POLICY 7.16: DATA OWNERSHIP</H4>

All data shall have an owner who is responsible for deciding its sensitivity.<P>

<H4>7.5 storage</H4><P>
It is essential that software and data stored on magnetic or equivalent media
should be properly handled, stored and protected so as to ensure the accuracy and
completeness of all records. A full set of all software and data must be retained and
filed for backup and recovery purposes.<P>

<H4>7.5.1 Write protection</H4><P>
Where possible all storage media should be write-protected prior to shipping and
at all times when not active in the system.<P>

<H4>7.5.2 Ibelling</H4><P>
Magnetic media should be labelled with a unique identifier and the relevant
privacy marking if appropriate. Methods of marking may be:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Magnetic tape spools - attaching marked labels to the front flange, and/or the
edge of their protective canisters, and/or the front of any suspension rings used to
support the tape spools during storage.
<LI>The front and back faces of cassettes and spines of protective boxes should be
clearly marked.
<LI>Removable magnetic disks and disk packs should be marked on the top of the
disk or pack or labels fixed to the top and side of the storage covers.
<LI>Floppy disks should be labelled on one side as specified by the manufacturer. If
disks are kept in boxes, the front and back of these should also be marked.
<LI>A log should be kept of their use with the following information included:
<UL>
<LI>system name and reference number,
<LI>date and time of last use,
<LI>present privacy status,
<LI>other corresponding tapes or disks,
<LI>name or initials of the person responsible for their use.
</UL></OL>
<H4>POLICY 7.17: MARKING OF MEDIA</H4><P>

Media shall be marked to indicate the most sensitive information on the media
in accordance with the Information Security Code. Where a medium is shared
it should be treated as containing the highest sensitivity level that may be
stored upon it.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.18- MARKING OF DATA</H4><P>

Data shall be marked in accordance with the Information Security Code.<P>

<H4>7.5.3 Documentation</H4><P>

Systems specifications, program listings, details of test data etc. for systems
containing sensitive information must be accorded a similar degree of protection
as that of the computer held data. They should be marked with the appropriate
privacy marking, locked away when not in use and spare copies held securely
either in a fire-resistant safe or at another location.<P>

<H4>7.5.4 Extraneous magnetic influences</H4><P>

Magnetic media may be corrupted accidentally simply by being in the wrong
location. Most electronic and electrical equipment generates a magnetic field
either of a permanent nature or specifically when powered up. Such magnetic
fields can both corrupt and erase data stored on disks and tapes.<P>

Floppy disks are much more prone to corruption from magnetic sources than hard
disks and it is recommended that when not in use they should be stored away
from office electrical equipment such as electronic typewriters, printers,
computers or telephones.<P>

<H4>7.6 Disposal of media</H4><P>

<H4>7.6.1 Magnetic media</H4><P>

Magnetic and optical media holding sensitive information requires precautions to
be taken before its reuse or disposal. Media which is damaged may be read easily
by sophisticated equipment. Even magnetic media which is overwritten many
times using seemingly complex patterns may be read using specialist techniques.
Details of the secure destruction facility may be found in chapter 10.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.19: ERASURE AND DESTRUCTION OF MEDIA</H4><P>

Where media is to leave the boundary of a system, or there is a requirement to
change a disk drive, or other vise dispose of media, one of the following rules
shall be applied.<P>
<DL>
<DT>A<DD>Destruction of media, using facilities approved by the Director of Security
and Investigation.<P>

</PRE>
If in the opinion of the system owner, the cost to BT of destroying media
outweighs the value of the information, the system owner may seek approvel from
DSecI to take alternative action. Also. see chapter 13 of the ISC.<P>

<H4>7.6.2 Disposal of computer equipment</H4><P>

Computer systems which are withdrawn from service pose a serious threat to BT
if they are not processed properly before disposal. All systems to be disposed of by
BT must have the disk formatted or destroyed according to policy 7.19. No
software must reside on the hard disk of any machines which are disposed of,
apart from the operating system. Entitlement to these must be documented at the
time of the transfer. All master copies of software should be either retained or
returned to the local computer administration unit for re-allocation. Managers
should note the possible conflict of interest associated with the local scrapping and
subsequent sale to BT people. If equipment is to be locally scrapped, the
procedure for doing this must be documented and all records must be made
available for audit and scrutiny.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.21: DISPOSAL OF COMPUTER EQUPMENT</H4><P>

No computer equipment containing non-volatile data storage capabilities that
has been used for processing IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE information shall
be disposed of as surplus equipment until it has been examined by a person
approved by the Director of Security and Investigation to ensure that all
sensitive inforrnation has been removed.<P>

<H4>7.6.3 Documents, printout and consumables</H4><P>

IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE waste must be disposed of under direct BT
supervision by burning, shredding using a Director of Security and Investigation
approved shredder, or by using a disintegrator.<P>

IN CONFIDENCE waste including personal and other sensitive data must be
destroyed by burning, shredding, or disintegration. For large quantities of IN
CONFIDENCE material, use can be made of the approved sensitive waste paper
collection services.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.22: DESTRUCTION OF PRINTER-BASED MATERIAL</H4><P>

Sensitive media shall be destroyed in accordance with the Information Security
Code.<P>

<H4>7.7 Computer viruses</H4><P>

A computer virus is an element of executable software that can be transferred
between programs, or between computers, with or without the knowledge of the
users. When triggered by an event determined by the perpetrator of the virus, it
can carry out any of a wide range of unauthorised activities. Examples include
infecting other programs or the operating system, sending infected messages to
other systems, deleting files. Furthermore, these unauthorised events may occur
while giving the impression that the computer is functioning normally.<P>

These actions can be malicious or benign, but in any event they breach the
integrity of the system. Given BT's dependency on computerised systems for
business-critical activities, it is essential that the integrity of such systems is
maintained.<P>

<H4>7.7.1 Vulnerability of systems</H4><P>

Computer systems can be designed with built in capabilities to resist viruses. This
may be achieved by erecting logical compartments enforcing strict segregation of
the operating system, and the program areas and data areas of each user. Another
measure is to prohibit terminals that have media entry capability or can be
connected to untrusted networks.<P>

While these restrictions may pary solve the problems for defence systems, they
are onerous, impractical and too expensive for most commercial of fice systems, IT
systems and network management systems. Because most commercial computer
systems are vulnerable to viruses, the primary protection depends mainly on
management policy and the active co-operation of the users to ensure that viruses
are not introduced into systems. However, many of the working practices that
have evolved with the Personal Computers encourage virus propagation.
Borrowing or lending disks containing programs or utilities is typical example.<P>

Downloading of software from the public databases and bulletin boards is
particularly risky.<P>

<H4>7.7.2 What a computer virus does</H4><P>

A virus does two things. Firstly it has a mechanism to propagate itself For
instance the perpetrator of the computer virus may attach it to a commonly run
program or routine. Having carried out the legitimate function of the program, the
virus takes control and attaches a copy of itself onto other programs that are
resident, either directly or by altering the operating system. Thus once a
computer has been infected it may infect the programs on any other floppy disk
placed in its environment. These in turn may infect any other computer in which
the infected disk is placed.<P>

Unless strict precautions are taken, advanced viruses are capable of causing
infection to remote computers via networking facilities.<P>

The second feature of the virus is its function. The function can consist of any
activity that can be performed by the computer. The virus function can be
triggered by any detectable event, eg: a time, a date, execution of a particular
routine, receipt of a message, deletion of a file or cancellation of a UID.<P>

In short, a computer virus is self-replicating software used to propagate a Trojan
Horse or Logic Bomb.<P>
<H4>7.7.3 Detection of computer viruses</H4><P>

In the event of discovering a virus the Local Computing Help Desk should be
contacted immediately for advice. For most parts of the business, this will be the
GCS Help Desk. The suspect machine and disks which have been used on the
machine should not be used further until the Help Desk has been contacted.
Programs are now becoming available for most popular machines that claim to be
able to prevent, detect or eradicate virus infections. These tools may certainly help
to detect the presence of viruses. Unfortunately the indeterminate nature of
computer viruses makes an absolute guarantee of detection virtually impossible.
Nevertheless, virus detection tools should be regarded as a contributory factor in
maintaining computer system integrity.<P>

The prevention of virus attack demands a fundamental shift of behavioural pattern
on the part of users of micro- and mini-systems. Many of the procedures that have
evolved to help and assist colleagues now need to be reconsidered in the context
of possible attack by computer viruses. For instance, operating system, program
or utility disks must not be borrowed or lent. Manufacturers source disks must be
securely protected, not left inside the instruction manual in the open. Transit
disks, that is those containing data files, should not be bootable or contain any
executable files. Except when being written to at the beginning of the transfer
process, the disks should be write- protected.<P>

<H4>7.7.4 Group policy on computer viruses</H4><P>

BT attaches considerable importance to the integrity of its computer systems,
particularly those systems that provide applications that are critical to the smooth
functioning of the Business. The recent emergence of computer viruses presents a
serious threat to BT s computer systems.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.23: VIRUSES: RESPONSIBILITY OF USERS</H4><P>

It is the personal responsibility of each individual to ensure that viruses are not
introduced into any BT system, or customers' system, that they come into
contact with.<P>

<H4>POLICY 7.24: VIRUSES: POLICY FOR HIGH IMPACT SYSTEMS</H4><P>

Detailed procedures on combating virus attacks shall be prepared for the
security of systems for which the impact of security failure is high. These

<H4>POLICY 7.25: VIRUS DETECTION</H4><P>

All disks inserted into customers' PCs must be virus checked before hand,
using approved virus detection software, or be certified as being virus free by
the manufacturer.<P>

<H4>7.7.5 Guidance</H4><P>

Utilities are available for many popular machines that claim to be able to prevent,
detect or eradicate computer viruses. While their rigour and scope is unproven,
they may certainly help detect the presence of viruses. Nevertheless, the primary
objective is to avoid infection in the first place by means of careful operating
procedures.<P>

The following steps should be followed by users to reduce the possibility of any
system being infected by computer viruses:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Reduce the risk by only using software that is sourced directly from reputable
manucturers and for which there is a customer/supplier contract that identifies
a requirement for quality so%ware.

<LI>Machine-readable media containing master copies of operating systems, programs
or utilities should be locked away securely at all times.

<LI>Computers containing executable copies of operating systems, programs and
utilities should be kept within a local secure perimeter, else some means of logical
access control should be deployed to prevent malicious infection.

<LI>Operating system and program media should never be lent, borrowed or
exchanged (except where the highest levels of personal trust prevail) .

<LI>Machine-readable media used for data file exchange should contain only the data.
Media should be inspected for executable files.

<LI>Machine-readable media should not be exposed to systems whose integrity is
unknown, for example, systems at home or university systems.

<LI>Public-domain programs shall not be downloaded, and in particular, computer
games should not be held or played on BT machines. Where games arrive as a
part of a software package they should be erased.

<LI>All incoming and outgoing machine-readable media should be checked for known
viruses. The preferred method of doing this is on a standalone machine, dedicated
to that purpose (commonly called a sheep-dip PC). For further information on the
approved high integrity product, please refer to section 11.
