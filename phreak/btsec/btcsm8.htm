<H4>8.1 Introduction</H4><P>

This section considers the administrative aspects of computer security. It must be
appreciated that all the technical security measures identified in earlier chapters
depend on the cooperation of the people who implement and operate the system.
It follows that these measures must be supported by appropriate procedural
guidelines and suitably informed staff.<P>

Some principles of wide applicability are identified, but their implementation will
depend on the size of the operation in question and on local organisation.<P>

<H4>8.2 Personnel</H4>

<H4>8.2.1 Staff instruction, training and responsibilities</H4>

All staff using computers and communications equipment should receive
instruction on security in general, and staff in particularly responsible positions
must be given special training. The observance of security procedures must be
supervised on a routine basis.<P>

In particular there should be close supervision of system support staff as they
often have unlimited access to all aspects of the system. Training should include
information on:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Local security measures, emergency procedures, backup processing and disaster
recovery plans,
<LI>Group commercial security policy,
<LI>disciplinary and legal consequences associated with unauthorised use and abuse
of resources or positions of trust,
<LI>commercial conditions applying, such as non-disclosure agreements, intellectual
property issues and privacy markings.
</UL>
If temporary or casual staff (including agency stafl) are to be employed in areas
where they have access to sensitive data, consideration must be given to the risks
involved. Specific guidance can be found in the Information Security Code.<P>

All staff must respect copyright in documentation or computer software when that
copyright is not owned by BT. They must not copy or modify such material unless
BT is permitted to do so. Staff must use such material only as permitted and must
not remove any copyright marking applied by a copyright owner.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.1: TRAINING</H4><P>

Managers shall ensure that their staff have received adequate security training
or instruction before allowing them to use BT systems.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.2: PERSONNEL CONSIDERATIONS</H4><P>

Employees working on high impact systems shall be trustworthy.<P>

<H4>8.2.2 Specific areas of responsibility</H4><P>
Areas of specific security responsibility must be identified for each system. An
individual, or where possible, individuals should be designated as responsible for
the definition, implementation and review compliance of the relevant security
policies and procedures specific to each area.<P>
Particular areas include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>UID and Password administration, including user authorisation procedures,
<LI>procedures relating to dialup access,
<LI>administration of user privilege authorisations,
<LI>administration and control of system resources,
<LI>control of software (design, installation, changes and maintenance),
<LI>media library,
<LI>handling of security violations.
</UL>
<H4>8.2.3 General areas of responsibility</H4><P>

Whether or not responsibilities are divided among a number of individuals, there
should always be an individual manager responsible for overall security and with
authority over all aspects of a system. In this manual the term 'systems
administrator' refers to the person responsible for the day to day administrative
operation of a particular system. Where a system shares resources, this term also
includes the person responsible for the day to day operation of these resources.<P>

For larger systems an individual should be appointed who should be responsible
for all aspects of systems security including the reliable and timely inspection of all
system and security logs and for any actions arising, also for monitoring the
investigation of breaches of security and liaising with the other security bodies as
necessary. The individual must have, or be trained to have, adequate knowledge of
computing to be able to handle his responsibilities and should have written
instructions on the procedure to be followed in the event of a security failure.<P>

In the case of small systems the above duties may be combined in which case it is
the responsibility of the managers concerned to ensure that all information under
their control is safeguarded.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.3: SECURITY RESPONSIBILITY</H4><P>

Every system shall have an individual who is responsible for the security of that
system.<P>

<H4>8.2.4 Separation of duties</H4><P>

The 'need to know' principle must always be applied to security. As far as staffing
constraints allow, individual responsibilities should be segregated so that no
employee has complete control or performs all aspects of a sensitive process or
operation. Individuals should only be permitted access to those resources which
are essential to their allotted tasks.<P>

Particular attention must be paid to the following areas:<P>
<UL>
<LI>applications should be produced to a specification and independendy tested and
certified to ensure that only code related to those requirements is produced.
Those responsible for development should have no access to either the
operational software or data.

<LI>operations and software support staff should not have access to the applications
source code which should preferably be developed on resources which have no
physical connection with the operational resources.

<LI>authorisation and scheduling of operational work should be separated from
physical operating and those responsible for running the processors should have
no access to the output.

<LI>systems programmers (software support staff) should not be given direct control
of operational processors and their activities should be subject to greater scrutiny
than other staff.

<LI>data library storage should be separate from physical operating, authorising and
scheduling.
</UL>
<H4>POLICY 8.4: PRIVILEGE LIMITATION</H4><P>

Authorised users shall be given the minimum level of privileges necessary for
them to fulfil their duties. Where necessary, duties shall be separated to
prevent collision.<P>

<H4>8.2.5 Definion of duties</H4><P>

Detailed written procedures should also be established for the guidance of those
responsible for operations, and especially for personnel involved in sensitive
activities such as physical access control, system controls, system management
and backup and recovery plans. Every project and system should provide detailed
instructions to users regarding the security procedures to be followed.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.5: GENERAL SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES</H4><P>

BT staff shall respect the security markings on BT property and handle it
accordingly.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.6: DEFINITION OF DUTES</H4><P>

All jobs having a specific security role must have written job descriptions which
fully describe their security responsibilities.<P>

All BT staff shall be personally responsible for, and accountable for, the
security of their area of work.<P>

<H4>8.2.6 Staff mobility</H4><P>

Where it is known that an individual is leaving BT, unless local management is
satisfied that no security risk is involved, they must remove the employee from the
computer environment immediately and:<P>
<UL>
<LI>delete all access privileges and recover any special access hardware issued to the
individual (such as passcards, keys, cryptographic or challenge units),
<LI>cancel or change all passwords known to that employee,
<LI>change codes for physical access doors or locks known to that employee,
<LI>advise the employee of his legal responsibilib to keep business information
confidential even after leaving,
<LI>recover all other property relating to the computer operation, for example,
manuals and documentation.
</UL>
Consideration must be given, especially in cases of disciplinary proceedings
leading to dismissal, to deny that individual access to BT premises and
information. It is not a requirement that the individual work out his notice. Where
an individual is departing a computer related dub but staying on in BT, local
management should take the measures detailed above where appropriate to
preserve security<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.7: STAFF LEAVING BT</H4><P>

Managers shall review the security implications of allowing continued access to
BT systems by anyone who is known to be considering leaving the company, or
is under notice.<P>

<H4>8.2.7 Breaches of security</H4><P>

All breaches of security shall be reported to line management. Known or
suspected criminal offences shall be reported immediately to the BT SecID
Investigation and Detection Unit (I&amp;DU) Help Desk. In this context, criminal
offences will include those misdemeanours criminalised under the Computer
Misuse Act 1990:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unauthorised access to computer material,
<LI>Unauthorised modification of computer material.
</UL>
Note that, because a computer virus propagates itself by means of unauthorised
program modification, the introduction of computer viruses into BT may constitute
a criminal offence.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.8: REPORTING OF SECURITY INCIDENTS</H4><P>

Security incidents shall be reported to line management. Known or suspected
criminal offences shall be reported immediately to the BT SecID Investigation
and Detection Unit (I&amp;DU).
<P>

<H4>8.2.8 Marking</H4><P>

All documentation (including soware and information stored on computer media
such as discs) must be marked with the appropriate security marking. It should be
subject to the rules set out in the Information Security Code as regards storage,
transmission, and destruction. The security marking should be reproduced on all
printed output and preserved if copied or transmitted.<P>

<H4>8.2.9 Removal of documentation</H4><P>

Administrators shall ensure that no media, data, files, reports or other
documentation, should be removed from sensitive computer areas without the
specific authorisation of line management in accordance with normal defined
practices.<P>

<H4>8.2.10 Information provided to outsiders</H4><P>

All release of information to non-BT personnel must be in accordance with the
Information Security Code and the Data Protection Act.<P>

When data has to be provided to outsiders for operational rather than service
reasons (eg system dumps to equipment or software providers) a written and
legally binding agreement should first exist to ensure confidentiality. These
agreements should ensure that any information given is only used for the purpose
of clearing faults. A record should be kept of all such exchanges of information.<P>

Numerous questionnaires are sent by outside companies to managers within BT.
All such requests for information should be forwarded to the relevant Business
Information Security Managers (BISMs) for consideration as to whether
completion and return is desirable. As a general guide, information about BT's
computing activities should not be released unless:<P>
<UL>
<LI>there is a statutory obligation, or
<LI>it is part of publicity for BT services and would be commercially advantageous.
</UL>
If information is released, care must be taken so that, for example, no advantage to
a competitor might accrue. Only a very general indication should be given of
hardware configuration, software in use and applications processed. Individuals
should only be named if a contact point is required.<P>

<H4>8.2.11 Disclosure of customer information</H4><P>

Customer information must not be disclosed unless its release has been approved
in accordance with the Information Security Code, the Data Protection Act, and
complies as necessary with the operating licence granted to BT.<P>

<H4>8.3 Disaster protection</H4><P>

BT is wholly dependent on computing systems for the profitability, continuity, and
control of its business. It is thereore vital that the availability and security of these
services is not compromised by a major disruption or disaster, such as physical
damage to the system hardware or large scale corruption of the system software
or data. This requires that business and operational plans and practices are in
place to ensure that the risk of disaster is minimised and that systems continue to
deliver the agreed levels of service, taking into account risk and cost. The Disaster
Protection Unit exists within D&amp;P to set standards and give advice. (See section
10).<P>

A disaster is defined as any circumstance in which one or more critical business
computer application(s) is not available to BT for internal or external customer
requirements as a result of:<P>

serious or catastrophic loss of, or failure of access to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>site
<LI>building
<LI>power and air-conditioning
<LI>data network
<LI>computer centres
<LI>dispatch
<LI>control centres
<LI>software
</UL>
non-availability greater than the number of hours determined by business impact
review.<P>

This policy provides a high-level statement applicable to all BT Group computing
capability. It is compliant with government legislation and with BT's Information
Security Code.<P>

<H6>Prevention</H6><P>

All buildings which contribute to the delivery of computer-derived services and
data must have physical security measures implemented to reduce the risk of a
disaster.<P>

BT should provide suitable standards of physical security to reduce the risk of
disaster occurring. The prevention measures should be monitored through
periodic reviews to determine the level of risk and adequacy of the measures to
meet the risks. Where shortfalls in protection are identified, prevention measures
should be implemented, taking into account risk and impact.<P>

<H6>Recovery</H6><P>

All major BT systems must be assessed to determine the value of the application
to the business process and operation, specifically the loss to the company as a
result of their unavailability. This business impact review process should assess
the costs, tangible and intangible, of an application's unavailability over a period of
time to identify the requirements for fallback and the optimum point for recovery.<P>

A recovery options analysis will produce the practical options for those
applications deemed to require recovery in the event of a disaster. The
recommended option will be chosen, taking into account the cost of recovery and
the business requirements of recovery.<P>

New applications must have recovery processes built in during system
development, based on user-defined fatlback design requirements. Existing
systems should be enhanced to the required level of fallback.<P>

Prevention and contingency plans must be provided for all computer centres and
multi-user systems. These will detail the procedures and information aimed at
reducing the risk of disaster and to provide contingent procedures that will allow
recovery of all applications to a fallback site.<P>

Recovery plans must be provided for each application to detail the management
requirements and responsibilities for recovering from a disaster, together with
instructions for recovering the critical applications.<P>

The effectiveness of the recovery facilities must be tested through a
comprehensive rehearsals programme.<P>

<H6>Strategy</H6><P>

Adherence to the policy will be affected by the development, implementation,
operation and maintenance of a computing disaster protection strategy. The
strategy will be maintained in line with business needs, corporate obligations and
technical evolution.<P>

Standards, working level procedures, audits and physical practices will be visible
at all levels of management and will demonstrate that the policy is understood and
that the strategy is implemented.<P>

The requirements of the policy must be met before the commencement of live
operations for all new applications systems.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.9: DISASTER PROTECTION</H4><P>

Owners of the operations of critical and high impact computer systems must
ensure that a disaster does not prevent the delivery of the agreed levels of
service, taking into account risk and cost.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.10: DISASTER PREVENTION</H4><P>

Facilities which provide BT with critical computer services, or access to those
services, shall be protected at all times from exposure to serious or catastrophic
loss<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.11: DISASTER RECOVERY</H4><P>

Procedures, hardware and software facilities shall be in place at all times to
ensure that in the event of disaster, access to critical computer-based
information and services will be restored.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.12: DISASTER STORAGE FOR PCs</H4><P>

Disaster storage for personally-controlled systems and data is the responsibility
of the owner.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.13: DISASTER RECOVERY RESPONSIBILlTY</H4><P>

The owner of the operation of centrally-controlled systems and data is the
custodian of the data and responsible for ensuring recovery is possible if there
is a disaster.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.14: DISASTER STORE LOCATION</H4><P>

Storage of critical or sensitive files must be away from the electronic system, in
a separate building off-site, as access to the disaster store may be denied.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.15: DISASTER STORE ENVIRONMENT</H4><P>

The security and environmental control must match the requirements of the
data being stored and a firesafe used to store data awaiting transfer to the
disaster store.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.16: DISASTER STORAGE</H4><P>

Where the storage is of user data or software, it must be with prior knowledge
and agreement of the user.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.17: DISASTER MEDIA ACCESS</H4><P>

Procedures must exist to ensure only authorised personnel have access to, or
are able to request movement of, a user's backup data.<P>

<H4>POLICY 8.18: DISASTER AUDIT</H4><P>

Facilities must exist that enable the user to audit the procedures.<P>
