<h2>Tapping Long Distance Calls</h2>

A satellite dish can be lots of phun watching all that shit, but
few people know it can also be used as a wiretapping device.  All
you need is your basic home satellite system, also know as
TVRO or televison receive only.  What you need to do is turn to
the AT&T satellite known as Telstar 301.  You'll notice between
channel 20 and 23 you will see a blank screen as if there was
a station there.  You won't hear anything except maybe an occasional
garbled sound.
<p>
This blank screen contains 12 MHz of phone calls,  each phone call
takes up only about 3.5KHz of this bandwidth so quite a few calls can be
packed on
one of these birds.  What you do to listen in to these calls is
the following.  Take a genral coverage shortwave receiver and hook
it's antenna to the video out of the TVRO receiver.  Make sure
your satellite receiver is either on channel 21 or 22.  Set your
shortwave reciever on lower side band (LSB) or turn the BFO on.
You will now be able to tune between 1.6Mhz and 7.5Mhz picking up
more calls to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Alaska, and the Caribbean than
you ever though possible.  Who would have dreamed there would have
been that many phone calls to listen to?
<p>
About every 3 1/2 Kilohertz there is a phone conversation.  If you do
not hear a phone converstation you will hear a trunk idle, a
continuous 2600hz, tone.  Since these are inband analog trunks you can
acutally listen for a click and a string of MF tones followed by a ring!
<p>
For frequencies above 4.1 MHz, it is best to switch to upper side band.
Also you can tune in Channel 8 of telstar 301, this seems to be US Sprint
service form the mainland to Hawaii.  Sprint Codes can be gotten
successfully by listening to the calls.
<p>
Telstar 301 can be found at 96W on the satellite dish.  Spacenet 2, which
is located at 69W is all US Sprint. Domestic calles as well as
overseas calls can be monitored.<p>
Other intresting satelites are ASC1 at 128W, Westar 2 at 79 W, and Comstar
D4 at 76W.  On these, simply tune across until you hit a blank channel that
looks like it's carrying a signal.  Then tune the shortwave receiver
anywhere between 1.6 and 7.5 Mhz.  If the conversation doesn't straighten
up swith to LSB or USB on the shortwave.
