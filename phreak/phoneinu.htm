PHONE IN USE CIRCUIT
--------------------

I thought I would try to post the schematic.  This circuit requires a separate
5 volt supply.  The branch of the circuit that contains C1, C2 & R5, R6 is 
only used as a passive tap. (So you can record the line when the rest of the 
circuit says 'off hook'.  It can be removed if not needed.  If used, it can 
directly drive a microphone input to a portable recoreder.

The Output of Q2 completes a path to ground when the phone lines gives an off
hook reading.  This can drive a relay (for a tape recorder motor) or an LED.
Be sure to include a current limiting resistor if an LED is used.  Also, D1
may be ommited if a non-inductive load is used (Relays and incandescent (sp?)
lamps are inductive)

The LED thingy like this that I made for my phone flashes nicely when the phone
rings (at the 20..25 Hz ring freq), so I can turn the ringer off, and still
get silent ring indication (a feature, not a bug)

Well, its not exactly postscript(tm), but if you stand back and squint, you'll
get the idea.
