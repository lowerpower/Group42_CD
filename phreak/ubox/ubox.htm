<h2>Ultimate Box Plans</h2>
<h4>by Codemaster and the Group42 boys</h4>

One day 4x and G-Man were hacking on some PIC microcontolers, trying
to produce tones by pulsing an i/o line off and on.  I came over and
was amazed at these little device the guys were messing with.  I was
thinking that these amazing little devices could replace all those
nasty analog oscallators on my redboxs and blueboxes.  And we found
out that they could!  Much better than you could believe with very
tight timing specs.<p>
The came up with this bit of <a href="dtmf_pic.txt">code</a> that produces
two tones at a time out of two seprate pins.  A lowpass filter to
clean up the square wave on the pins, then mixing them togeather
make the Ultimate Tone Box.  You can generate any type of Multi
Frequency tones you like, just change the timing parameters.<p>
Also of interest is this pic <a href="dtmf.txt">code</a> I found by
Eric Smith.  It produces DTMF tones out of 1 pin using pulse width
modulation.  Very interesting code.<p>
The newest Basic Stamps put out by Parallex now have simalar routies
in them as the Eric Smith DTMF code.  Using these devices it should
be very easy for just about anyone to built there own ultimate box.
With the Basic Stamp you have the added benifit that the code can
be redownloaded again and again as needed for different tone requirements.
<p>
The possibilities are endless, and less expensive that the old lower
tech ways of building boxes.
