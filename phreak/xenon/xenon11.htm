The following is a rather extensive listing of domain names for all the
major computer systems on the Internet.  Some are UUCP mail network
feeds only, while the majority are actual domain addresses for some
major corporations, universities, government, and military computers.
For more information on these domain names, use rs.internic.net, and/or
ds.internic.net.
