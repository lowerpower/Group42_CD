An article on improvised protection<P>
                              by Necross Sinister<P>
Something that happened to a friend of mine forced me to write this article
and submit it for this issue.  Namely, he and his girlfriend were assaulted by
a group of skinheads. Most attacks by gangs or groups involve hands, feet,
clubs and knives.  With modern materials you reduce the effects of these
attacks allowing you to escape or fight back.  Heavy leather clothing offers
some protection which can be augmented or replaced a number of ways.  First,
any sort of protection can be increased by adding studs or spikes which make
less pleasant for those punching anyone wearing them. Studs and spikes also
increase the damage that is inflicted when added to sleeves, gloves and boots.<P>
Extremely impact resistant armor can be made by wearing sports and/or dirt
bike protective gear or screwing, riveting or epoxying the plates to jackets
and or pants.  (besides, it gives you that nifty, post-holocaust look.  go
ahead, make a fashion statement.) Pieces of sheet metal or plastic can also be
shaped and attached to garments for protection, they can also be concealed by
putting a second layer of material over them. <P>
Another concept is wiring up
studs or spikes as contacts for a stun gun.  Plastic plates with openings can
be more effective against stabbing attacks with heavy wire mesh attached.  And
finally, for protection against firearms bulletproof vests (bullet resistant -
ed.) or material (kevlar -ed.) (ok, split hairs, but you're right in thinking
there are those who don't realize the distinction-sin) is available through
some gunshops and most military/paramilitary magazines such as Soldier of
Fortune. <P>
If protection from attacks is needed, using any or all of these
suggestions can increase your chances of winning.  In future issues I will
present photos or illustrations of functional street armor. OCL/Magnitude may
have kits available in the future through the mail-order catalog for those who
do not wish (or are too inept) to make their own.  Oh by the way, since the
attack my friend has covered his jacket with studs and invested in spiked arm bands.<P>
