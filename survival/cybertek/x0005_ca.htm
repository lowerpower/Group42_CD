Caching is the process of hiding equipment or materials in a secure storage
place with the view to future recovery for operational use.  The ultimate
success of caching may well depend upon attention to detail, that is,
professional competence that m ay seem of minor importance to the untrained
eye.  Security factors, such as cover for the caching party, sterility of the
items cached, and removal of even the slightest trace of the caching
operations are vital.  Highly important, too, are the technical factors that
govern the preservation of the items in usable condition and the recording of
data essential for recovery.  Successful caching entails careful adherence to
the basic principles of clandestine operations, as well as familiarity with the technicalities of caching.<P>

<B>Section 1</B>
<HR>
<B>Caching Considerations</b><P>
Caching considerations that are vital to the success of the caching operation

may be done in a variety of operational situations.  For example, cached

supplies can meet the emergency needs of personnel who may be barred from

their normal supply sources by sudden developments or who may need travel

documents and extra funds for quick escape.  Caching can help solve the supply

problems of long-term operations conducted far from a secure base.<P>
Caching also can provide for anticipated needs of wartime operations in areas

likely to be overrun by the enemy.<P>
<B>PLANNING FOR A CACHING OPERATION</B><P>
Caching involves selecting items to be cached, procuring those items, and

selecting a cache site.  Selection of the items to be cached requires a close

estimate of what will be needed by particular units for particular operations.

Procurement of the items usually presents no special problems.  In fact, the

relative ease of procurement before an emergency arises is one of the prime

considerations in favor of caching.  When selecting a cache site, planners

should always ensure that the site is accessible not only for emplacement, but

also for recovery.  When planning a caching operation, the planner must

consider seven basic factors.<P>
<B>1.  Purpose and Contents of the Cache</B><P>
Planners must determine the purpose and contents of each cache because theses

basic factors influence the location of the cache, as well as the method of

hiding.  For instance, small barter items can be cached at any accessible and

secure site because they can be concealed easily on the person once recovered.<P>
However, it would be difficult to conceal rifles for a Guerrilla Band once

recovered.  Therefor, this site must be in an isolated area where the band can

establish at least temporary control.  Certain items, such as medical stock,

have limited shelf life and require rotation periodically or special storage

considerations, necessitating easy access to service these items.  Sometimes

it is impossible to locate a cache in the most convenient place for an

intended user.  Planners must compromise between logistical objectives and

actual possibilities when selecting a cache site.  Security is always the

overriding consideration.<P>
<B>2.  Anticipated Enemy Action</B><P>
In planning the caching operation, planners must consider the capabilities of

any intelligence or security services not participating in the operation.

They should also consider the potential hazards the enemy and its witting or

unwitting accomplice s present.  If caching is done for wartime operational

purposes, its ultimate success will depend largely on whether the planners

anticipate the various obstacles to recovery, which the enemy and its

accomplices will create if the enemy occupies the area.  What are the

possibilities that the enemy will preempt an ideal site for one reason or

another and deny access to it?  A vacant field surrounded by brush may seem

ideal for a particular cache because it is near several highways.  But such a

location may also invite the enemy to locate an ordnance depot where the

cache is buried.<P>
<B>3.  Activities of the local Population</B><P>
Probably more dangerous than deliberate enemy action are all of the chance

circumstances that may result in the discovery of the cache.  Normal activity,

such as construction of a new building, may uncover the cache site or impede

access to it.  Bad luck cannot be anticipated, but it can probably be avoided

by careful and imaginative observation of the prospective cache site and of

the people who live near the site.  If the cache is intended for wartime use,

the planners must project how the residents will react to the pressures of war

and conquest.  For example, one of the more likely reactions is that many

residents may resort to caching to avoid having their personal funds and

valuables seized by the enemy.  If caching becomes popular, any likely cache

site will receive more than normal attention.<P>
<B>4.  Intended Actions by Allied Forces</B><P>
Using one cache site for several clandestine operations involves a risk of

mutual compromise.  Therefore, some planners should rule out otherwise

suitable caching sites if they have been selected for  other clandestine

purposes, such as drops or safe houses.  A site should not be located where it

may be destroyed or rendered inaccessible by bombing or other allied military

action, should the area be occupied by the enemy.  For example, installations

likely to be objects of special protective efforts by the occupying enemy are

certain to be inaccessible to the ordinary citizen.  Therefore, if the cache

is intended for wartime use, the caching party should avoid areas such as

those near key bridges, railroad intersections, power plants, and munitions

factories.<P>
<B>5.  Packaging and Transportation Assets</B><P>
Planners should assess the security needs and all of the potential obstacles

and hazards that a prospective cache site can present.  They should also

consider whether the operational assets that could be used for packaging and

transporting the package to the site.  Best results are obtained when the

packaging is done by experts at a packaging center.  The first question,

therefor, is to decide whether the package can be transported from the

headquarters or the field packaging center to the cache site securely and soon

enough to meet the operational schedules.  If not, the packaging must be done

locally, perhaps in a safe house located within a few miles of the cache site.

If such an arrangement is necessary, the choice of cache sites may be

restricted by limited safe house possibilities.<P>
<B>6.  Personal Assets</B><P>
All who participate directly in emplacement will know where the cache is

located.  Therefore, only the fewest possible and the most reliable persons

should be used.  Planners must consider the distance from the person's

residence to the prospective c ache site and what action cover is required for

the trip.  Sometimes transportations and cover difficulties require the cache

site to be within a limited distance of the person's residence.  The above

considerations also apply to the recovery personnel.<P>
<B>7.  Caching Methods</B><P>
Which cache method to use depends on the situation.  It is therefore unsound

to lay down any general rules, with one exception.  Planners should always

think in terms of suitability, for example, the method most suitable for each

cache, considering its specific purpose; the actual situation in the

particular locality; and the changes that may occur if the enemy gains

control.<P>
<B>Concealment.</B><P>
Concealment requires the use of permanent man-made or natural

features to hide or disguises the cache.  It has several advantages.  Both

employment and recovery usually and be done with minimum time and labor, and

cached items concealed inside a building or dry cave are protected from the

elements.  Thus, they require less elaborate packaging.  Also, in some cases,

a concealed cache can be readily inspected from time to time to ensure that it

is still usable.  However, there is always the chance of accidental discovery

in addition to all the hazards of wartime that may result in discovery or

destruction or a concealed cache or denial of access to the site.  The

concealment method, therefore, is most suitable in cases where an

exceptionally secure site is available or where a need for quick access to the

cache justifies a calculated sacrifice in security.<P>
Concealment may range from securing small gold coins under a tile in the floor

to walling up artillery in caves.<P>
<B>Burial.</B><P>
Adequate burial sites can be found almost anywhere.  Once in place, a

properly buried cache is generally the best way of achieving lasting security.

In contrast to concealment, however, burial in the ground is a laborious and

time-consuming method of caching.<P>
The disadvantages of burial are that-<P>
*  Burial almost always requires a high-quality container or special wrapping

   to protect the cache from moisture, chemicals and bacteria in the soil.<P>
*  Emplacement or recovery of a buried cache usually takes so long that the

   operation must be done after dark unless the site is exceptionally
   secluded.<P>
*   It is especially difficult to identify and locate a buried cache.<P>
<B>Submersion.</B><P>  Submersion sites that are suitable for secure concealment of a

submerged cache are few and far between.  Also, the container of a submerged

cache must meet such high standards for waterproofing and resistance to

external pressure that the use of field expedients is seldom workable.  To

ensure that a submerged cache remains dry and in place, planners must

determine not only the depth of the water, but the type of bottom, the

currents, and other facts that are relatively difficult for nonspecialists to

obtain.  Emplacement, likewise requires a high degree of skill.  At least two

persons are needed for both emplacement and requires additional equipment.  In

view of the difficulties - especially the difficulty of recovery - the

submersion method is suitable only on rare occasions.  The most noteworthy

usage is the relatively rare maritime re-supply operation where it is

impossible to deliver supplies directly to a reception committee.  Caching

supplies offshore by submersion i s often  preferable to sending a landing

party ashore to bury a cache.<P>
<B>SELECTION OF THE SITE</B><P>
The most careful estimates of future operational conditions cannot ensure that

a will cache will be accessible when it is needed. However, criteria for a

site selection can be met when three questions are answered.<P>
<B>Criteria for Site Selection</B><P>
Can the site be located by simple instructions that are unmistakably clear to

someone who has never visited the location?  A site may be ideal in every

respect, but if it has no distinct, permanent landmarks within a readily

measurable distance it must be ruled out.  Are there at least two secure

routes to and from the site?  Both primary and alternate routes should provide

natural concealment so that the emplacement party and the recovery party can

visit the site without being seen by anyone normally in the vicinity.  An

alienate escape route offers hope of avoiding detection and recovered at the

chosen site in all seasons?  Snow and frozen ground create special problems.<P>
Snow on the ground is a hazard because it is impossible to erase a trail in

the snow.  Planners must consider whether seasonal changes in the foliage will

leave the site and the dangerously exposed.<P>
<B>The Map Survey</B><P>
Finding a cache site is often difficult.  Usually, a thorough systematic

survey of the general area designated for the cache is required.  The survey

is best done with as large-scale map of the area as is available.  By

scrutinizing the map, the planners can determine whether a particular sector

must be ruled out because of its nearness to factories, homes, busy

thoroughfares, or probable military targets in wartime.  A good military-type

map will show the positive features in the topography; proximity to adequate

roads or trails, natural concealment (for example:  surrounding woods or

groves), and adequate drainage.  A map also will show the natural and man-made

features in the landscape.  It will provide the indispensable reference points

 for locating a cache site:  confluences of streams, dams and waterfalls, road

junctures and distance markers, villages, bridges, churches, and cemeteries.<P>
<B>The Personal Reconnaissance</B><P>
A map survey normally should show the location of several promising sites

within the general area designated for the cache.  To select and pinpoint the

best site, however, a well-qualified observer must examine each site

firsthand.  If possible, whoever examines the site should carry adequate maps,

a compass, a drawing pad or board for making sketch maps or tracings, and a

metallic measuring line. (A wire knotted at regular intervals is adequate for

measuring.  Twine or cloth measuring tapes should not be used because

stretching or shrinking will make them inaccurate if they get wet.) The

observer should also carry a probe rod for probing prospective burial sites,

if the rod can be carried securely.  Since the observer seldom completes a

field survey without being noticed by local residents, his action cover is of

great importance.  His cover must offer a natural explanation for his

exploratory activity in the area.  Ordinarily, this means that a n observer

who is not a known resident of the area can pose as a tourist or a newcomer

with some reason for visiting the area.  However, his action cover must be

developed over an extended period before he undertakes the actual

reconnaissance.  If the observer is a known resident of the area, he cannot

suddenly take up hunting, fishing, or wildlife photography without arousing

interest and perhaps suspicion.  But he must build up a reputation for being a

devotee of his sport or hobby.<P>
<B>Reference Points</B><P>
When the observer finds a suitable cache site, he prepares simple and

unmistakable instructions for locating the reference points.  These

instructions must identify the general area (the names of general recognizable

places, from the country down to the nearest village) and an immediate

reference point.  Any durable landmark that is identified by its title or

simple description can be immediate reference point (for example, the only

Roman Catholic church in a certain village or the only bridge o n a named road

between two villages).  The instructions must also include a final reference

point (FRP), which must meet four requirements:<P>
(1)   It must be identifiable, including at least one feature that can be used

      as a precise reference point.<P>
(2)   It must be an object that will remain fixed as long as the cache may be

      used.<P>
(3)   It must be near enough to the cache to pinpoint the exact location of

      the cache by precise linear measurements from the FRP to the cache<P>
(4)  It should be related to the immediate reference point by a simple route

     description, which proceeds from the immediate reference point to the FRP<P>
Since the route description should be reduced to the minimum essential, the

ideal solution for locating the cache is to combine the immediate reference

point and the FRP into one landmark readily identifiable, but sufficiently

secluded.  The following objects, when available, are sometimes ideal

reference points: small, unfrequented bridges, and dams, boundary markers,

kilometer markers and culverts along unfrequented roads, a geodetic survey

marker, battle monuments, and wayside shrines.  When such reference points are

not available at an otherwise suitable cache site, natural or man-made objects

may serve as FRP's:  distinct rocks, posts for power or telephone lines,

intersections in stone fences or hedgerows, and gravestones in isolated

cemeteries.<P>
<B>Pinpointing Techniques</B><P>
Recovery instructions must identify the exact location of the cache.  These

instructions must describe the point where the cache is placed in terms that

relate in to the FRP.  When the concealment method is used, the cache

ordinarily is placed inside the FRP, so it is pinpointed by a precise

description of the FRP.  A submerged cache usually is pinpointed by describing

exactly how the moorings are attached to the FRP.  With a buried cache, any of

the following techniques may be used.<P>
Placing the cache directly beside the FRP.  The simples method is to place the

cache directly beside the FRP.  Then pinpointing is reduced to specifying the

precise reference point of the FRP.

Sighting the cache by projection,  This method may be used if the FRP has one

flat side long enough to permit precise sighting by projecting a line along

the side of the object.  The burial party places the cache a measured distance

along the sighted line.  This method may also be used if two precise FRP's are

available, by projecting a line sighed between the two objects.  In either

case, the instructions for finding the cache must state the approximate

direction of the cache from the FRP.  Since small errors in sighting are

magnified as the sighted line is extended, the cache should be placed as close

to the FRP as other factors permit.  Ordinarily this method becomes unreliable

if the sighted line is extended beyond 50 meters.<P>
Placing the cache at the intersection of measured lines.  If two FRP's are

available within several paces, the cache can be one line projected from each

of the FRP's.  If this method is used, state the approximate direction of the

cache from each FRP .  To ensure accuracy, neither of the projected lines

(from the FRP's to the point of emplacement) should be more than twice as long

as the base line (between the two FRP's).  If this proportion is maintained,

the only limitation upon the length of t he projected lines is the length of

the measuring line that the recovery party is expected to carry.  The recovery

party should carry two measuring lines when this method is used.<P>
Sighting the cache by compass azimuth.  If the above methods of sighting are

not feasible, one measured line may be projected by taking a compass azimuth

from the FRP to the point where the cache is placed.  To avoid confusion, use

an azimuth to a cardinal point of the compass (north, east, south, or west).<P>
Since compass sightings are likely to be inaccurate, a cache that is

pinpointed by this method should not be placed more than 10 meters from the

FRP.<P>
<B>Measuring Distances</B><P>
The observer should express all measured distances in a linear system that the

recovery party is sure to understand - ordinarily the standard system for the

country where the cache is located.  He should use whole numbers (6 meters,

not 6.3 or 6.5, etc.) to keep his instructions as brief and as simple as

possible.  To get an exact location for the cache in whole numbers, take

sightings and measurements first.  If the surface of the ground between the

points to be measured is uneven, the linear distance should be measured on a

direct line from point to point, rather than by following the contour of the

ground.  This method requires a measuring line long enough to reach the full

distance from point to point and enough to be pulled taut without breaking.<P>
<B>Marking Techniques</B><P>
The emplacement operation can be simplified and critical time saved if the

point where the cache is to be buried is marked during the reconnaissance.

If a night burial is planned, the point of emplacement may have to be marked

during a daylight reconnaissance.  This method should be used whenever

operational conditions permit.  The marker must be an object that is easily

recognizable but that is meaningless to an unwitting observer.  For example, a

small rock or a branch with its butt placed at the point selected for the

emplacement may be used.<P>
During a personal reconnaissance, the observer must not only pinpoint the

cache site, but also gather all the incidental information required for

planning the emplacement operation.  It is especially important to determine

the best route to the site and at least one alternate route, the security

hazards along these routes, and any information that can be used to overcome

the hazards.<P>
Since this information is also essential to the recovery operation, it must be

compiled after emplacement and included in the final cache report.  Therefore,

the observer should be thoroughly familiar with the Twelve-Point Cache Report

before he starts a personal reconnaissance.  This report is a checklist for

the observer to record as much information as possible.  Points 6 through 11

are particularly important.  The personal reconnaissance also provides an

excellent opportunity for a preliminary estimate of the time required for

getting to the site.<P>
<B>The Alternate Site</B><P>
As a general rule, planners should select an alternate site in case unforeseen

difficulties prevent use of the best site.  Unless the primary site is in a

completely deserted area, there is always some danger that the emplacement

party will find it occupied as they approach, or that the party will be

observed as they near the site.  The alternate site should be far enough away

to be screened from view from the primary site, but near enough so that the

party can reach it without making a second t rip.<P>
<B>The Concealment Site</B><P>
A site that looks ideal for concealment may be revealed to the enemy for that

very reason.  Such a site may be equally attractive to a native of an occupied

country to hide his valuables.  The only real key to the ideal concealment

site is careful ca sing of the area combined with great familiarity with local

residents and their customs.  The following is a list of likely concealment

sites:<P>
*Natural caves and caverns, and abandoned mines and quarries.<P>
*Walls (hidden behind loose bricks or stones or hidden a plastered surface).<P>
*Abandoned buildings.<P>
*Infrequently used structures (stadiums and other recreational facilities, and
railroad facilities on spur lines).<P>
*Memorial edifices (mausoleums, crypts, monuments).<P>
*Public buildings (museums, churches, libraries).<P>
*Ruins of historical interest.<P>
*Culverts.<P>
*Sewers.<P>
*Cable conduits.<P>
The concealment site must be equally accessible to the person emplacing and

the person recovering.  However, visits by both persons to certain interior

sites may be incompatible with the cover.  For instance, a site in a house

owned by a relative of the emplacer may be unsuitable because there is no

adequate excuse for the recovery person to enter the house if he has no

connection with the owner.<P>
The site must remain accessible as long as the cache is needed.  If access to

a building depends upon a personal relationship with the owner, the death of

the owner or the sale of the property might render it inaccessible.

Persons involved in the operation should not be compromised if the cache is

discovered on the site.  Even if a cache is completely sterile, as every cache

should be, the mere fact that it has been placed in a particular site may

compromise certain persons.  If the cache were discovered by the police, they

might suspect the emplacer because it was found in his relative's house.
The site must not be located where potentially hostile persons frequently

visit.  For instance, a site in a museum is not secure if police guards or

curious visitors frequently enter the museum.<P>
To preserve the cache material, the emplacer must ensure the site is

physically secure for the preservation of the cached material.  For example,

most buildings involve a risk that the cache may be destroyed or damaged by

fire, especially in wartime.  The emplacer should consider all risks and weigh

them against the advantages of an interior site.

A custodian may serve to ease access to a building or to guard a cache.
However, the use of such a person is inadvisable, as a custodian poses an

additional security risk.  He may use the contents of the cache for personal

profit or reveal its location.<P>
<B>The Burial Site</B><P>
In selecting a burial site, consider the following factors along with the

basic considerations of suitability and accessibility:<P>

<B>Drainage</B><P>
This includes the elevation of the site and the type of soil.  The importance

of good drainage makes a site on high ground preferable unless other factors

rule it out.  Moisture is one of the greatest natural threats to the contents

of a cache.  Swam p muck is the most difficult soil to work in.  If the site

is near a stream or river, ensure that the cache is well above the all-year-

high-water mark so that it will not be uncovered if the soil is washed away.<P>
<B>Ground Cover</B><P>
The types of vegetation at the site will influence the choice.  Roots of

deciduous tress make digging very difficult.  Coniferous trees have less

extensive root systems.  Also, the presence of coniferous trees usually means

that the site is well drained.  Does the vegetation show paths or other

indications that the site is frequented too much for secure caching?  Can the

ground cover be easily restored to its normal appearance when burial is

completed?  Tall grass reveals that it has been trampled, while an overlay of

leaves and humus can be replaced easily and will effectively conceal a freshly

refilled hole.<P>
<B>Natural Concealment</B><P>
The vegetation or the surrounding terrain should offer natural concealment for

the burial and recovery parties working at the site.  Planners should

carefully consider seasonal variations in the foliage.<P>
<B>Types of Soil</B><P>
Sandy loam is ideal because it is easy to dig and drains well.  Clay soil

should be avoided because it becomes quite sticky in wet weather and in dry

weather it may become so hard that it is almost impossible to dig.<P>
<B>Snowfall and Freezing</B><P>
If the cache must be buried or recovered in winter, data on the normal

snowfall, the depth to which the ground freezes in winter, and the usual dates

of freezing and thawing will influence the choice of the site.  Frozen ground

impedes digging and requires additional time for burial and recovery.  Snow on

the ground is especially hazardous for the burial operation.  It is

practically impossible to restore the snow over the burial site to its normal

appearance unless there is more snowfall or a b risk wind.  Also, it is very

difficult to ensure that no traces of the operation are left after the snow

has melted.<P>
<B>Rocks and Other Subsurface Obstructions</B><P>
Large obstructions that might prevent use of a particular site can be located

to some extent before digging by probing with a rod or stake at the exact spot

selected for the cache.<P>
<B>The Submersion Site</B><P>
To be suitable for a submerged cache, a body of water must have certain

characteristics.  The presence of these characteristics can be determined only

by a thorough survey of the site.  Their importance will be understood after

familiarization with t he technicalities of submersion as discussed in Section
3, Emplacement.  Submersion usually requires a boat, first for reconnoitering,
then for emplacement.  Thus, the accessibility problems involved in submersion

usually narrow down to the availability of a boat and the action cover for

using it.  If there is no fishing or pleasure boating at the site the cover

for this peculiar type boating may be a real problem.<P>
In tropical areas the course of streams or rivers is frequently changed by<P>
seasonal rainfall and can cause many problems.  Keep this fact in mind when

choosing the site and when selecting reference points.<P>
<B>Recovery</B><P>
Since the method for recovering a cache is generally similar to that for

emplacing (Section 3) a cache, it need not be described in full.  However,

several important considerations should be stressed in training for a recovery

operation.<P>
<B>Practical Exercises</B><P>
Anyone who is expected to serve as a recovery person should have the

experience of actually recovering dummy caches, if field exercises can be

arranged securely.  It is especially desirable for the recovery person to be

able to master the pinpointing techniques.  Mastery is best attained by

practice in selecting points of emplacement and in drafting, as well as in

following instructions.<P>
<B>Equipment</B><P>
Although the equipment used in recovery is generally the same as that used in

emplacement, it is important to include any additional items that may be

required in recovery in the cache report.  A probe rod may not be essential

for emplacement, but it is necessary to have some object roughly the same size

as the cache container to fill the cavity left in the ground by removal of a

buried cache.  Some sort of container of wrapping material may be needed to

conceal the recovered cache while it is being carried from the cache site to a

safe house.  Recovery of a submerged cache may require grappling lines and

hooks, especially if it is heavy.<P>
<B>Sketch of the site</B><P>
If possible, the observer should provide the recovery person with sketches of

the cache site and the route to the cache site.  If the recovery person must

rely exclusively on verbal instructions, as in the case when communications

are limited to radio telephone (RT) messages, he should draw a sketch of the

site before starting on the recovery operation.  He should use all the data in

the verbal instructions to make the sketch as realistic as possible.  Drawing

a sketch will help to clarify any misunderstanding of the instructions.  Also,

a sketch can be followed more easily than verbal instructions.  It may also be

helpful for the recovery person to draw a sketch of the route from the

immediate reference point to the site.  But he should no t carry this sketch

on him because if he were apprehended the sketch might direct the enemy to the

cache.<P>
<B>Preliminary Reconnaissance</B><P>
Checking the instructions for locating the cache may be advisable, especially

when the recovery operation must be performed under stringent enemy controls

or when there is no extra time for searching.  Careful analysis of the best

available map can minimize reconnoitering activity in the vicinity of the

cache and thus reduce the danger of arousing suspicion.  If recovery must be

done at night, the recovery person should find the cache by daylight and place

an unnoticeable marker directly over it .<P>
<B>Probe Rod</B><P>
The recovery person can avoid digging at the wrong spot by using a probe rod

before starting to dig.  He should push and turn the probe rod into the ground

by hand, so that it will not puncture the cache's container.  Never pound the

probe rod with a hammer.<P>
<B>Procedure for Digging and Refilling the Hole</B><P>
The recovery procedure is the same as for the burial, except for two points.

First, never use a pick for digging the hole because it might puncture the

container and damage the cached items.  Second, it may be necessary  to fill

the hole with other objects in addition to soil after the cache is removed.<P>
Sometimes it is possible to fill the hole with rocks, sticks, or other readily

available objects at the site.  If no such objects are found during the

preliminary reconnaissance, the recovery person should carry to the site an

object roughly the same size as the cache container.<P>
<B>Sterilization of the Site</B><P>
As with emplacement, the recovery operation must be preformed in such a way

that no traces of the operation are left.  Although sterilization is not as

important for recovery as for emplacement, it should be done as thoroughly as

time permits.  Evidence that a cache has been recovered might alert the enemy

to clandestine activity in the area and provoke countermeasures.<P>
<B>Section 2.</B> 
<HR>
<B>Packaging</B><P>
Packaging usually involves packing the items to be cached, as well as the

additional processing in protecting these items from adverse storage

conditions.  Proper packaging is important because inadequate packaging very

likely will render the items unusable.  Since special equipment and skilled

technicians are needed for best results, packaging should be done at

headquarters or a field packaging center whenever possible.  However, to

familiarize operational personnel with the fundamentals of packaging, so that

they can improvise field expedients for emergency use, thus section discusses

determining factors, steps in packaging, wrapping materials, and criteria for

the container.<P>
<P>Determining factors.</B><P>
The first rule of packaging is that all processing is tailored to fit the

specific requirements of each cache.<P>
The method of packaging, as well as the size, shape, and weight of the package

is determined by the items to be cached, by the method of caching, and,

especially, by the way the cache is recovered and used.  For instance, if

circumstances require one man to recover the cache by himself, the container

should be no larger than a small suitcase, and the total weight of container

and contents no more than 30 pounds.  Of course, these limits must be exceeded

with some equipment, but the need for larger packages should be weighed

against the difficulties and risks in handling them.  Even if more than one

person is available for recovery, the material should be divided whenever

possible into separate packages of a size and weight readily portable by one

man.<P>
Another very important factor in packaging concerns adverse storage

conditions.  Any or all of the following conditions may be present: moisture,

external pressure, freezing temperatures, and the bacteria and corrosive

chemicals found in some soil an d water.  Animal life may present a hazard;

insects and rodents may attack the package.  If the cache is concealed in a

exterior site, larger animals also may threaten it.  Whether the packaging is

adequate usually depends upon how carefully the conditions at the site were

analyzed in designing the cache.  Thus, the method of caching (burial,

concealment, or submersion) should be determined before the packaging is done.<P>
It is equally important to consider how long the cache is to be used.  Since

one seldom knows when a cache will be needed, a sound rule is to design the

packaging to withstand adverse storage conditions for at least as long as the

normal shelf life o f the contents to be cached.<P>
<B>STEPS IN PACKAGING</B><P>
The exact procedure for packaging depends upon the specific requirements for

the cache and upon the packaging equipment available.  There are Nine Steps

that are almost always necessary in packaging.<P>
<B>Inspecting</B><P>
The items to be cached must be inspected immediately before packaging to

ensure they are complete, in serviceable condition, and free of all corrosive

or contaminative substances.<P>
<B>Cleaning</B><P>
All corrodible items must be cleaned thoroughly immediately before the final

preservative coating is applied.  All foreign matter, including any

preservative applied before the item was shipped to the field, should be

removed completely.  Throughout the packaging operation, all contents of the

cache should be handled with rubber or freshly cleaned cotton cloves.  Special

handling is important because even minute particles of human sweat will

corrode metallic equipment.  Also, any fingerprints on the contents of the

cache may enable the enemy to identify those who did the packaging.<P>
<B>Drying</B><P>
When cleaning is completed, every trace of moisture must be removed from all

corrodible items.  Methods of drying include:  wiping with a highly absorbent

cloth, heating or applying desiccant.  Usually heating is best, unless the

item can be damaged by heat.  To dry by heating, the item to be cached should

be placed in an oven for at least 3 hours at a temperature of about 110'F.  An

oven can be improvised from a large metal can or drum.  In humid climates, it

is especially important to dry the oven thoroughly before using it by

preheating it to at least 212'F.  Then, insert the equipment to be cached as

soon as the over cools down to about 110'F.  If a desiccant is used, it should

not touch any metallic surface.  Silica gel is a satisfactory desiccant, and

it is commonly available.<P>
<B>Coating With a Preservative</B><P>
Apply a light coat of oil to weapons, tools, and other items with unpainted

metallic surfaces.  A coat of paint may suffice for other metal items.<P>

<B>Wrapping</B><P>
When drying and coating are completed, wrap the items to be cached in a

suitable material (see paragraph below on Wrapping Materials.)  The wrapping

should be as nearly waterproof as possible.  Each item should be wrapped

separately, so that one perforation in the wrapping will not expose all items

in the cache.  The wrapping should fit tightly to each item to eliminate air

pockets, and all folds should be sealed with a waterproof substance.<P>
<B>Packing</B><P>
Several simple rules must be observed when packing items in the container.

All moisture must be removed from the interior of the container by heating or

applying desiccant.  A long-lasting desiccant should be packed inside the

container to absorb an y residual moisture.  If silica gel is used, the

required amount can be calculated by using the ratio of 15 kilograms of silica

gel to 1 cubic meter of storage space within the container.  (This figure is

based on two assumptions:  the container is completely moisture proof and the

contents are slightly moist when inserted.)  Therefore, the ratio allows an

ample margin for incomplete drying and can be reduced if the drying process is

known to be highly effective.
Air pockets should be eliminated as much as possible by tight packing.

Thoroughly dried padding should be used liberally to fill air pockets and to

protect the contents from shock.  Clothing and other items, which will be

useful to the recovery party, should be used for padding if possible.  Items

made of different metals should never touch, since continued contact may cause

corrosion through electrolytic action.<P>
<B>Enclosing Instructions for Use of Cached Equipment</B><P>
Written instructions and diagrams should be included if they facilitate

assembly or use of the cached items.  Instructions must be written in a

language that recovery personnel can understand.  The wording should be as

simple as possible and unmistakably clear.  Diagrams should be self-

explanatory since the eventual user may not be able to comprehend written

instructions because of language barriers.<P>
<B>Sealing &amp; Testing Seals by Submersion</B><P>
When packing is completed, the lid of the container must be sealed to make it

watertight.  Testing can be done by entirely submerging the container in water

and watching for escaping air bubbles.  Hot water should be used if possible

because hot water will bring out leaks that would not be revealed by a cold

water test.<P>
<B>WRAPPING MATERIALS</B><P>
The most important requirement for wrapping material is that it be moisture

proof.  Also, it should be self-sealing or adhesive to a sealing material; it

should be pliable enough to fit closely, with tight folds; and it should be

tough enough to resist tearing and puncturing.  Pliability and toughness may

be combined by using two wrappings: an inner one that is thin and pliable and

an outer one of heavier material.  A tough outer wrapping is essential unless

the container and the padding are adequate to prevent items from scraping

together inside the cache.  Five wrapping materials are recommended for field

expedients because they often can be obtained locally and used effectively be

unskilled personnel.<P>
<B>Aluminum Foil</B><P>
For use as an inner wrapping. aluminum foil is the best of the widely

available materials.  It is moisture proof as long as it does not become

perforated and provided the folds are adequately sealed.  The drawbacks to its

use for caching are that the thin foils perforate easily, while the heavy ones

(over 2 mils thick) tend to admit moisture through the folds.  The heavy-duty

grade of aluminum foil generally sold for kitchen use is adequate when used

with an outer wrapping.  Scrim-backed foil, which is heat-sealable, is widely

used commercially to package articles for shipment or storage.  Portable heat-

sealers that are easy to use are available commercially.  Or, sealing can be

done with a standard household iron.<P>
<B>Moisture-Resistant Papers</B><P>
Several brands of commercial wrapping papers are resistant to water and

grease.  They do not provide lasting protection against moisture when used

alone, but they are effective as an inner wrapping to prevent rubber, wax and

similar substances from s ticking to the items in the cache.<P>
<B>Rubber Repair Gum</B><P>
This is a self-sealing compound generally used for repairing tires;  it makes

an excellent outer wrapping.  Standard commercial brands come in several

thicknesses; 2 mils is the most satisfactory for caching.  A watertight seal

is produced easily by placing two rubber surfaces together and applying

pressure manually.  The seal should be at least 1/2 inch wide.  Since rubber

repair gum has a tendency to adhere to items, an inner wrapping of non-

adhesive material must be used with it, and the backing should be left on the

rubber material to keep it from sticking to other items in the cache.<P>
<B>Grade C Barrier Material</B><P>
This is a cloth impregnated with mircrocrystalline wax that is used

extensively when packing for storage of for overseas shipment.  Thus, it is

generally available, and it has the additional advantage of being self-

sealing.  Although it is not as effective as rubber repair gum, it may be used

as an outer wrapping over aluminum foil to prevent perforation of the foil.

Used without an inner wrapping, three layers of grade C barrier material may

keep the contents dry for as long as three months, b ut it is highly

vulnerable to insects and rodents.  Also, the wax wrapping has a low melting

point and will adhere to many items, so it should not be used without an inner

wrapping except in emergencies.<P>
<B>Wax Coating</B><P>
If no wrapping material is available, an outer coating of microcrystralline

wax, paraffin or a similar waxy substance can be used to protect the contents

against moisture.  It will not provide protection against insects and rodents.

The package should be hot-dipped in the waxy substance, or the wax can heated

to molten form and applied with a brush.<P>
<B>THE CONTAINER</B><P>
The outer container serves to protect the contents from shock, moisture and

other natural hazards to which the cache may be exposed to.<P>
<B>Criteria for the Container</B><P>
The ideal container should be:<P>
*Completely watertight and airtight after sealing.<P>
*Noiseless when handled and its handles should not rattle against the body of

the container<P>
*Resistant to shock and abrasion.<P>
*Able to withstand crushing pressure.<P>
*Lightweight in construction.<P>
*Able to withstand rodents, insects, and bacteria.<P>
*Equipped with a sealing device that can be closed and reopened easily and

repeatedly.<P>
*Capable of withstanding highly acidic or alkaline soil or water.<P>
<B>The Standard Stainless Steel Container</B><P>
The standard stainless steel container comes in several sizes.  Since the

stainless steel container is more satisfactory than any that could be

improvised in the field, it should be used whenever possible.  Ideally, it

should be packed at headquarter s or at a field packaging center.  If the

items to be cached must be obtained locally, it is still advisable to use the

stainless steel container because its high resistance to moisture eliminates

the need for an outer wrapping.  Packers should, however, use a single

wrapping even with the stainless steel container to protect the contents from

any residual moisture that may be present in the container when it is sealed.<P>
<B>The Field Expedient Container</B><P>
Obviously the ideal container cannot be improvised in the field, but the

standard military and commercial containers discussed below can meet caching

requirements if they are adapted with care and resourcefulness.  First, a

container must be sufficiently sturdy to remain unpunctured and retain its

shape through whatever rough handling or crushing pressure it may encounter.

(Even a slight warping may cause a joint around the lid to leak.) Second, if

the lid is not already watertight and airtight , packers can make it so by

improvising a sealing device.  The most common type of sealing device includes

a rubber-composition gasket or lining and a sharp metal rim that is pressed

against common sealing device is a threaded lid.  Its effectiveness can be

increased by applying heavy grease to the threads. (Metallic solder should not

be used for sealing because it corrodes metal surfaces when exposed to

moisture.)  Whenever any non-stainless metal container is used, it is

important to apply several coats of high-quality paint to all exterior

surfaces.<P>
<B>Instrument Containers.</B><P>
Ordinarily, aircraft and other precision instruments

are shipped in steel containers with a waterproof sealing device.  The

standard instrument containers range from 1/2 gallon to 10 gallon sizes.  If

one of suitable size can be found, only minimum modifications may be needed,

In the most common type of instrument container, the only weak point is the

nut and bolt that tightens the locking band around the lid.  These should be

replaced with a stainless steel nut and bolt .<P>
<B>Ammunition Boxes.</B><P>
Several types and sizes of steel ammunition boxes that have

a rubber-gasket closing device are satisfactory for buries caches.  An

advantage of using ammunition boxes as a cache container, is that they are

usually available at a military depot.<P>
<B>Steel Drums.</B><P>
A caching container of suitable size may be found among the

commercially used steel drums for shipping oil, grease, nails, soap, and other

products.  The most common types, however, lack an adequate sealing device, so

a waterproof material should be used around the lid.  Fully removable head

drums with lock-ring closures generally give a satisfactory seal.<P>
<B>Glass Jars.</B><P>The advantage of using glass is that it is waterproof and does

not allow chemicals, bacteria and insects to pass through it.  Although glass

is highly vulnerable to shock, glass jars of a sturdy quality can withstand

the crushing pressure normally encountered in caching.  However, none of the

available glass container have an adequate sealing device for the joint around

the lid.  The standard commercial canning jar with a spring clamp and a rubber

washer is watertight, but the metal clamp is vulnerable to corrosion.

Therefore, a glass jar with a spring clamp and a rubber washer is an adequate

expedient for short-term caching of small items, but it should not be relied

upon to resist moisture for more than a year.<P>
<B>Paint Cans.</B><P>
Standard cans with reusable lids require a waterproof adhesive

around the lids.  It is especially important to apply several coats of paint

to the exterior of standard commercial cans because the metal in these cans is

not as heavy as that in metal drums.  Even when the exterior is thoroughly

painted, paint cans probably will not resist moisture for more than a few

months.<P>
Section 3.
<HR>
<B>Methods of Emplacement</B><P>
Since burial is the most frequently used method of emplacement, this section

describes first the complete procedure for burial, followed by a discussion of

emplacement procedures peculiar to submersion and concealment.  The last area

discussed is the preparation of the cache report-a vital part of a caching

operation.<P>
<B>BURIAL</B><P>
When planners have designed a cache and selected the items for caching, they

must carefully work out every step of the burial operation in advance.

<B>Horizontal and Vertical Caches</B><P>

Ordinarily, the hole for a buried cache is vertical (the hole is dug straight

down from the surface).  Sometimes a horizontal cache, with the hole dug into

the side of a steep hill or bank, provides a workable solution when a suitable

site on level or slightly sloping ground is not available.  A horizontal

cache may provide better drainage in areas of heavy rainfall, but is more

likely to be exposed by soil erosion and more difficult to refill and restore

to normal appearance.<P>
<B>Dimensions of the Hole</B><P>
The  exact dimensions of the hole, either vertical or horizontal, depend on

the size and shape of the cache container.  As a general rule, ensures that

the hole is large enough for the container to be inserted easily.  The

horizontal dimensions of the hole should be about 30 centimeters longer and

wider than the container.  Most importantly, it should be deep enough to

permit covering the container with soil to about 45 centimeters.  This figure

is recommended for normal usage because a more shallow burial risks exposure

of the cache through soil erosion or inadvertent uncovering by normal

indigenous activity.  A deeper hole makes probing for recovery more difficult

and unnecessarily prolongs the time required for burial and recovery.<P>
<B>Excavation Shoring</B><P>
If there is a risk that the surrounding soil will cave in during excavation,

boards or bags filled with subsoil may be used to shore the sides of the hole.

Permanent shoring may be needed to protect an improvised container from

pressure or shock.<P>
<B>Equipment</B><P>
The following items of equipment may be helpful or indispensable in burying a

cache, depending upon the conditions at the site:<P>
*Measuring instruments (a wire or metal tape and compass) for pinpointing the

site.<P>
*Paper and pencil for recording the measurements.<P>
*A probe rod for locating rocks, large roots, or other obstacles in the

subsoil.<P>
*Two ground sheets on which to place sod and loose soil.  An article of

clothing may be used for

   small excavation if nothing else is available.<P>
*Sacks (sandbags, flour sacks) for holding subsoil.<P>
*A spade or pickax, if the ground is too hard for spading.<P>
*A hatchet for cutting roots.<P>
*A crowbar for prying rocks.<P>
*A flashlight or lamp if burial is to be done at night.<P>
<B>The Burial Party</B><P>
Aside from locating, digging, and refilling the hole, the most important

factors in this part of the emplacement operation may be expressed with one

word: <B>Personnel.</B>  Since it is almost impossible to prevent every member of the

burial party from knowing the location of the cache, each member is a prime

security problem as long as the cache remains intact.  Thus, planners must

keep the burial party as small as possible and select each member with utmost

care.  Once selected, each member must have adequate cover to explain his

absence from home or work during the operation, his trip to and from the site,

and his possession of whatever equipment cannot be concealed on the way.<P>
Transportation for the burial party may be a problem, depending on the number

of persons, how far they must go, and what equipment they must take.  When

planners have worked out all details of the operation, they must brief every

member of the burial party on exactly what he is to do from start to finish.<P>
<B>The Operational Schedule</B><P>
The final step in planning the emplacement operation is to make a schedule to

set the date, time, and place for every step of the operation that requires

advance coordination.  The schedule will depend mainly on the circumstances,

but to be practical it must include a realistic estimate of how long it will

take to complete the burial.  Here generalizations are worthless, and the only

sure guide is actual experience under similar conditions.  Planners should

consider three things with respect to scheduling.  A careful burial job

probably will take longer than most novices will expect.  Therefore, if

circumstances require a tight schedule, a dry run or test exercise before

taking the package to the site may be advisable.<P>
Unless the site is exceptionally well concealed or isolated, night burial will

be required to avoid detection.  Because of the difficulties of working in the

dark, a nighttime practice exercise is especially advisable.  The schedule

should permit waiting for advantageous weather conditions.  The difficulties

of snow have already been mentioned.  Rainy weather increases the problems of

digging and complicates the cover story.  If the burial is to be done at

night, a moonless or a heavy overcast night is desirable.<P>
<B>Site Approach</B><P>
Regardless of how effective the cover of actions during the trip to the cache

site, the immediate approach must be completely unobserved to avoid detection

of the burial.  To reduce the risk of the party being observed, planners must

carefully select the point where the burial party disappears, perhaps by

turning off a road into woods.  They should as carefully select the

reappearance point.  In addition, the return trip should be by a different

route.  The burial party should strictly observe the rule for concealed

movement.  The party should proceed cautiously and silently along a route that

makes the best use of natural concealment.  Concealed movement requires

foresight, with special attention to using natural concealment while

reconnoitering the route and to preventing rattles when preparing the package

and contents.<P>
<B>Security Measures at the Site</B><P>
The burial party must maintain maximum vigilance at the caches site, since

detection can be disastrous.  The time spent at the site is the most critical.

At least one lookout should be on guard constantly.  If one man must do the

burial by himself, he should pause frequently to look and listen.  The burial

party should use flashlight or lanterns as little as possible, and should take

special care to mask the glare.  Planning should include emergency actions in

case the burial party is interrupt ed.  The party should be so thoroughly

briefed that it will respond instantly to any sign of danger.  Planner should

also consider the various escape routes and whether the party will attempt to

retain the package or conceal it along the escape route .<P>
<B>Steps in Digging and Refilling</B><P>
Although procedures will vary slightly with the design of the cache, persons

involved in caching operations must never overlook certain basic steps.  The

whole procedure is designed to restore the site to normal as far as  possible.<P>
<B>Site Sterilization</B><P>
When the hole is refilled, make a special effort to ensure that the site is

left sterile-restored to normal in every way, with no clues left to indicate

burial or the burial party's visit to the vicinity.  Since sterilization is

most important for the security of the operation, the schedule should allow

ample time to complete these final steps in an unhurried, thorough manner.

Dispose of any excess soil far enough away from the site to avoid attracting

attention to the site.  Flushing the excess soil into a stream is the ideal

solution.  Check all tools and equipment against a checklist to ensure that

nothing is left behind.  This should include all personnel items that may drop

from pockets.  To keep this risk to a minimum, members of the burial party

should carry nothing on their persons except the essentials for doing the job

and covering their actions.<P>
Make a final inspection of the site for any traces of the burial.  Because

this step is more difficult on a dark night, use of a carefully prepared

checklist is essential.  With a night burial, returning to the site in the

daytime to inspect it for telltale evidence may be advisable, if this can be

done safely.<P>
