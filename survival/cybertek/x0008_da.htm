What I've done this issue is to compile some generalized &quot;household hints&quot;

which might help retain your freedom in the event of increased government

oppression, or other survival situation.  Although I feel the general trend of

things is downhill these days, perhaps an ounce of prevention will avoid the

need of a pound of cure.<P>
The first thing you should do is to present as much as a profile of &quot;the

average man in the street&quot; as possible.  I know this may upset some of our

more colorful readers, but the decision is yours.  What's more important in

your mind, a little self-expression now, or less hassle not only today but

also after the shit hits the fan?<P>
If you want to express yourself today, protest whatever the government is up

to, write articles which piss bluenoses off, or engage in similar

controversial activities then adopt a second identity, and keep the two

separate.  Not only is this a wise decision, but also perfectly legal.  You

have a right by law to go by any name you wish as long as no illegal intent is

shown.  In fact, every survivalist should have at least one alternate identity

kept handy in case the shit hits the fan.  Paper tripping is still fairly easy

to do, so do it now before it becomes more difficult.  I suggest people

reading this who are interested in alternate identities to read The Paper Trip

I and II by Barry Reid (available from Eden Press, and other publishers) and

Secret and Alternate Identities by CWL (available from Consumertronics).  If

there is sufficient interest and I get letters from readers saying so I'll do

an article about paper tripping in a future installment.<P>
The second objective is to acquire as much knowledge in as wide a range of

fields as possible.  Ignorance is no excuse; knowledge is power and anyone who

doesn't believe it is either misguided or brain dead.  To assist you in any

situations which may come up today you should have a working knowledge in as

many technological, outdoor, scientific, and military subjects as possible.<P>

Firearms &amp; other weaponry, computers, electronics, camping &amp; other outdoor

skills, mechanics, hunting &amp; trapping , foraging, homesteading, agriculture,

chemistry, and medicine are just a few topics which are handy to know about.<P>

While you won't be able to learn everything, strive to learn as much as you

can.  Also, learn how your ancestors lived in the previous century before

everything was mass produced by corporations and people had to do it

themselves.  This knowledge will prove to be invaluable.

To start, you can go to your local library and take out some books on the

above topics which interest you the most. While the range of books is limited

to non-controversial topics; you'll be surprised just how much info is there.

As an example, in a typical library you should be able to pick up books on

mechanics, computers, electronics, outdoor skills, and firearms.  With those

five topics you will acquire knowledge on how to keep essential equipment

running when support for them fails, learn how to make state of the art

communications and analytical systems that will help you keep in touch and

make strategic decisions based on data you receive, design sensor and

information gathering systems to tell you what's going on with the outside

world, stay alive and prosper in primitive conditions, and defend yourself

against attack.  Essentially, from having knowledge in those 4 skills, you

have gained an significant edge in successfully surviving disasters ranging

from economic depression, to natural disasters, to a government dictatorship's

rise to power.  If you live near a college or open military post, check out

their libraries too.  They usually contain more specialized knowledge.  On the

more &quot;hardcore&quot; topics, there are several good mail order outlets which sell

information ranging from homemade C4 explosive to computer hacking.<P>

If a particular topic piques your interest, then you can pursue it further.

Most technological and outdoor enthusiasts are more than happy to help you

learn, there are educational institutions which offer courses on the whole

spectrum of scientific fields, and if you look around you can find a

sympathetic member of the National Guard or veteran who will give you some

advice on how to stay alive in hostile situations.  American Survival Guide

magazine even has a free service for survivalists to contact each other for

assistance, information, and other needs.<P>
The second stage of acquiring knowledge is keeping informed about the world

around you.  This is harder than it seems.  Yes it is true that we live in the

information age, but most of the info is tainted.  While it is easy to learn

that Joe Blow killed his wife because she was servicing the milkman or that

Donald Trump bought another city block, it is hard to find out news that

effects you or has some significance on your existence.  You can thank the

mass media for that.  So, if you really want to stay informed, I suggest you

stay away from television, newspapers, and other forms of mass media.  All it

is for the most part is propaganda for the corporations, government

bureaucrats, and big shots; all of which have screwed the American people

since the 1960s, and still try to think of ways to take away your rights and

keep you from figuring out what's going on so they can screw you some more.<P>
There are several alternatives out there which are a million times better than

the traditional mass media.  Two are alternative press publications, and

international shortwave stations.  They offer a more objective and unbiased

view than the TV networks and publishing corporations, and you don't get a

large spoonful of attempted brainwashing from the big shots when you read

them.  This is important because you will be using this information to

determine when the shit hits the fan in one of its many incarnations and when

to take action.<P>
All that is needed to receive international broadcasts is a radio receiver

capable of picking up the shortwave radio band (1.6-30 Mhz.).  These receivers

are available from Radio Shack and mail order outlets.  Costs start at $60.

When you listen to Radio Sweden, the BBC, Radio Deutsche Welle (Germany's

Shortwave Station), and other international broadcasters, you'll notice the

tremendous difference between them, and domestic broadcasters like CBS

(Colombia Brainwashing Service).  Alternative press is more common out there

than you think.  Several are available at news stands nationwide.  The others

are also easy to get.<P>
While you also are preparing your mind, you should also be preparing your

body. Take up a sport and include it in your daily routine.  While knowledge

is useful, if you don't have the physical strength you'll still be at a marked

disadvantage.  Good sports are martial arts, running/walking, endurance weight

lifting, and tennis.  While this does take up some time, it's very good for

you both now and in the future, and you'll feel better overall.

Once you have assumed a low profile and started acquiring knowledge you can
start planning and making preparations.  One of the first things you should do
in this stage is to make an assessment of what you have that could help you in
a survival situation, and what you will further need in order of priority to
bring your preparedness up to a sufficient level.  This seems the hardest part
of getting ready, but once you reach this stage you should have acquired
sufficient knowledge of the be st way for you to do this.  You will also have
acquired at little cost a wide variety of knowledge in many different fields;
which will also help you in the present.<P>
