A very good stock of electronic and electrical components and equipment is much
desired for survival groups of any size that have on board an electronics
expert.  I rate electronic expertise just below medical and commando expertise
and just above mechanical expertise for group survival.<P>
Electronic sensors and sentries can be built that are more sensitive than
humans are continuously alert.  They do not entirely replace human guards but,
when properly designed and used, are a tremendous saver of manpower and
aggravation. They can be battery or solar powered.  Complex MOS type circuits
now exist that draw only nano- or microamps of current and will last six
months to a year on a single 9 volt radio battery.  Electronics expertise is
required to operate, maintain, and repair communications equipment. Electronic
methods can be devised to confuse, rout, and destroy an enemy, and to trigger
booby traps and bombs.  If power is available, computer expertise can be used
to quickly analyze complex survival situations for intelligent decision
making.<P>
I feel that if your survival group does not have an electronics expert on
board, you are probably not adequately prepared for survival!  Those expert in
electronics, from my experience, aside from this expertise, are also very
valuable because they are creative, intelligent, resourceful, skilled with
tools, and hard-working.  Be careful when selecting an electronic expert.<P>
Many people profess electronics expertise when they only have a passing
knowledge of electronics, have a good theoretical background but little or no
hands-on experience, or are experts in some very limited area of electronics.<P>
While the amount of electronics components is certainly in the 100,000s and no
one could possibly master 1% of all of the available electronics technology,
your expert should be highly skilled and experienced (particularly circut
realizations) in both linear and digital circuitry with at least passing
familiarity with thousands of components.  Some microprocessor and software
experience is desired.  And, of course adequate parts, equipment, and books.<P>
For those of you wishing to learn about electronics, first go to your local
Radio Shack, and pick up a copy of Getting Started in Electronics, any books
from their Understanding.... series that you might find interesting, and all
of the Engineer's Mini-Notebook series.  All of this will set you back
anywhere from $10 to $50, depending on far you want to go with it, but those
books will give you an excellent start.  You should also pick up a copy or
even a subscription to Radio-Electronics magazine, which carries monthly
electronics project articles, information, and advertisements to parts
suppliers.  Then, with the information in those book, buy some parts, and
start building some simple projects.  You might also want to take a course in
electronics at your local college, or adult continuing education classes, and
if you're still in high-school, your school might have an electronics class,
or a &quot;tech center&quot; where you can attend; however a lot of those classes can
contain a lot of theory, which while important is too overly stressed.  All
the theory in the world won't help you when you need to fix something in the
field with minimal parts support, or need a quick and dirty solution to an
electronics problem.  That sort of expertise comes from hands-on experience
with a good technician.  Make sure your class covers a lot of the practical
aspects.  If you're still in high school or college try to get a part-time job
in a TV repair shop.  Not only will you get paid, you'll also get an
invaluable education in practical electronics.  Don't worry if you're bad in
Math.  Mathematical proficiency for electronics is, for the most part, a myth,
and many math geniuses I knew sucked at electronics, and many good technicians
I knew of were only average at math.  For the street-tech, hands-on style
electronics; you'll get by with only an average proficiency in math.<P>
Start with the basics, and try to learn a little about everything.  Once you
mastered that, then you can begin to specialize, although too much
specialization is a bad thing. Try to keep your knowledge as broad as
possible.  If you decide to specialize a little, try to do it in a field that
has a large potential for street-technology, as it will greatly enhance your
chances for survival having a marketable needed skill to fall back on in hard
times.  The wizards of old were held in awe and respected because of their
supposed special knowledge; with many people coming to them for assistance in
matters they were unable to handle.  Being proficient in practical electronics
can make you a wizard of the 21st. century, and if anything else, will at
least enable you to make a comfortable living.  The best fields for
specialization are telecommunications, RF technology, and digital
electronics/computers.  These fields have since their inception have totally
integrated with society in a very short period of time, and will continue to
be a major element in it.<P>
