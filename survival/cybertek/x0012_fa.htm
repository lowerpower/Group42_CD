Someone heard about this somewhere and decided to pass it along to us.  We
don't know where it came from but figured we'd oblige our anonymous
contributor.  While we don't advocate breaking any laws of course, we do have
to admit that it's a fine example of good old American ingenuity and pass it
along for educational purposes only to show that there is still a bit of
imagination and an inventive spirit left somewhere in this country.<P>
It involves getting a piece of obnoxious artwork and making three photocopies
of it.  The traditional one was a photocopy of someone's middle finger
sticking up but certain unnamed people thought it would be appropriate (and
perhaps more interesting) to go for something more heavy duty.  The actual
suggestions are hardly appropriate for printing here so we'll leave them up to
you to think of.  After getting three copies of the artwork in question one
then attaches them end to end so that they look like three connected pieces of
computer printout paper (use scotch tape).  You then call the FAX number you
desire and feed in the first sheet.  This trick would work best after the
place is closed for the day or otherwise unoccupied for long periods of time.<P>
When the first sheet comes out attach it the same way to the last sheet.  This
will result in an endless loop of paper. What happens is that this keeps
feeding into the FAX machine transmitting the same image.  On the receiving end the FAX machine will most likely run out of paper, be prevented from
receiving other calls, and be effectively neutralized.<P>
Like we said before, don't do this as it would probably be construed as an
annoyance phone call and/or misuse of telecommunications facilities.
