Taking a look at the &quot;underground culture&quot; scene for many years now, I am
saddened and disturbed at what I am seeing.  Many people have been involved
&quot;spreading the word&quot; about the problems in our society, but have been falling
short in their effectiveness in creating a positive change in society.  Some
of their actions have actually been slowing, or halting the pace of change
which is most desperately needed.<P>
Within the past year while I've been working on what is now this magazine, I
checked out several &quot;underground&quot; magazines, and interviewed several people
involved in various aspects of the underground culture.  The results were
disappointing to ay the least.  It appeared that while everyone was more than
happy to complain about what was wrong, not very many were knowledgable about,
or even interested in the actual means to take action, and go about helping
institute the change which they so much desire. While this is a general trend
in society anyway, I still found it heart-breaking that I would find it at the
same extent in the &quot;underground&quot;.  Some people were even, upon hearing of my
proposed project, were horrified that I could do such a thing.<P>
One of the most disturbing things I saw was a desire to complain, and demand
action against various problems which have no relevance to the current
problems which plague this country.  This country is slipping into a
dictatorship, and some people seem to be more interested in saving the
Mongolian Cluster-Rat than saving the country they live in. While I have some
respect for these people for at least speaking up about something, I cannot
comprehend why they are more interested in that than in keeping from being put
into a concentration camp!  Common sense dictates that before one goes and
tries to fix something outside his house, he should make sure his house is in
order first.  Without having the problems in this country fixed first, you
might as well forget about everything else, as you won't get anywhere with
them.  This country, which is founded on the best principles of government
ever conceived, was the product of people who got up, and took some real risks
to create, and preserve it. If it wasn't for them, it is very likely we
wouldn't be around right now.<P>
The second disturbing thing I saw was how for the most part the &quot;underground&quot;
was simply content to use &quot;symbolic protest&quot;, and little else.  It appears
that many people haven't learned that symbolic protest is worthless, and only
gets you mark ed for later persecution.  If you want to change something, you
have to do more than send in petitions, and walk around with signs.  The
bureaucrats in the government, and the corporations that put them there don't
care about what the people think, as long as they stay in power.  The only
way to get the message across to those lizards is to push back when they push
you.  There is quite a bit that everyone can do in order to instill fear in
them, and get them back in line, without needlessly exposing one's self.<P>
William Powell in The Anarchist Cookbook said:<P>
    &quot;I detest symbolic protest, as it is an outcry of weak, middle-of-the-
    road.....eunuchs.  If an individual feels strongly enough about something
    to do something about it, then he shouldn't prostitute himself by doing
    something symbolic.  He should get out and do something real.&quot; (Pg. 62)<P>
The last, but not least of disturbing trends I've seen is a disdain to
absolute hatred of the concept of survivalism by the vast majority of the
underground.  Why this is totally baffles me.  I'm a non-violent person, but I
realize the advantages of being adequately prepared, particularly when my,
and my family's welfare and safety are at stake.  Many members of the
&quot;underground&quot; upon my talking with them, appear to support the current drive
to take away Second Amendment rights; when anyone with enough sense should
realize that doing so could only make things worse!  You are up against people
who have murdered, pillaged, and ruined thousands of lives without so much as
batting an eyelash, and will continue to be as well equipped, and as ruthless
after your means of defense and preparedness are gone, as they were before.
Since this is the case, why deny yourself of getting as much of an edge as you
can.  Again William Powell had something to say about it, which sums things
up:<P>
    &quot;I have no patience with individuals who claim that everything will be
    beautiful if guns and other weapons are outlawed.  These people do not
    have the foresight to realize that, if weapons are made illegal, they will
    only be possessed by enemies of the people.....I feel very strongly that
    every person should be armed and that he or she should be prepared for the
    worst.  There is no justice left in the system.&quot;  (Pg. 78)<P>
This is not to say that everyone in the underground is responsible for these
problems.  There are quite a few good people out there, mostly Cyberpunks, who
are doing something real to help this country, but by and large there still
leaves a lot to be desired.  Hopefully, the culture can either mature, or
become re-born, so greater progress for real, positive change in this country
can be made.  Then it could become something that its founding fathers can be
proud of.<P>
