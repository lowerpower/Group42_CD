What is a Gurkha Khukri Fighting Knife?  The Ghurkhas are members of Nepalese
commando regiments serving in the British and Indian armed services.  They are
renowned for their ferocity, bravery, and efectiveness in hand-to-hand combat.<P>
The Khukri Fighting Knife is the crescent-shapped issue combat knife used by
the Gurkhas.  Its two versions: 1) 19 oz, 9.5&quot; blade, 14&quot; overall.  2) 22 oz.,
12&quot; blade, 17&quot; overall.
A few months ago, I ordered both versions from: ATLANTIC CUTLERY CORP., 2143
Gees Mill Rd., Conyers, Ga. 30207, 800- 241-3595/404-922-3700.  (Excellent
prices, quality products. -ed.)  The smaller officers version costs $25.95;
while the enlisted version sells for $23.95.  (These prices are up-to- date.
-ed.)  Included are rugged rawhide scabbards and two smaller knives (about 2&quot;
long) with each Khukri (apparently used for food preparation) The knives are
geniune Ghurka military surplus ( AC provided copies of documentation with
them) complete with ceremonial bloodletting notches.  The knives arrived
medium sharp but I honed them to perfection.<P>
The Khukri is a very rugged and well-built fighting knife perfectly designed
for hand-to-hand combat.  The curvature of the blade, balance, blade point,
and grip construction are ideal for decapitating, slashing or stabbing an
assailant or other slime.  Its beauty does not lie in chrome blade and carved
grip, but in their highly regarded survival utility.  The blade is hardened
BS970EN43 steel. The grip is walnut, amari,, or similiar hardwood.  I feel
that the officers' version has a better grip and better overall construction.<P>
However, both are very sturdy and well-constructed.  Machettes, and hunting,
and US military knives (including bayonets) are no substitute for the Khukri.
Although large, the machette is primarily designed for cutting vegetation.<P>
Hunting and US military knives are anemic in comparison.  They simply lack
that macho feel that tells you that you are optimally fitted for combat.  Both
are good for the gross butchering of meat but neither version (including the
small accompanying knives) is satisfactory for a dinner knife for typical
American eating habits.  Even though balance indicates good throwing, I had no
luck here.<P>
I strongly recommend buying at least one set of Khukris and that you use these
knives as your primary survival and retreat knives.  I think that you, too,
will be as highly impressed with them as I am.<P>
