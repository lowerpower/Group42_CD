In light of some moves made by our elected representitives and their
bureaucratic underlings that could be considered totalitarian, people across
the country have been forming citizen's militias. The concept of a citizen
militia is well grounded in our country's law; which considers every citizen
above the age of 18 part of it, and makes a distinction betwen it, calling us
the unorganized militia, and the organized militia which is the national guard
and reserves. In addition, surpeme court cases involving firearms ownership
have consistently based their decisions on the suitability of weapons for
militia purposes. If one checks the laws, they will find that contrary to the
recent ramblings of certain socialist media types, these militias are totally
legal. Recently, we received this press release from one of these militia
units...<P>

communications needs between different militia units.  Standard
OPSEC and COMSEC procedures apply.

Militia units should adopt their own secure SOIs for intra-unit

contact and credential verification. DO NOT USE THIS SOI FOR
CLASSIFIED OR MISSION CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS.

in case of interference (14 to 5 to 11 to 30 to 35 to 14...). Tell your
party to "Go up one.", and then proceed to the next secondary
