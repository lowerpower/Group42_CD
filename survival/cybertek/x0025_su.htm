Highly reflective sunglasses (motorcycle police type) have major survival
advantages.  They can be obtained in both prescription and non-prescription
form in any style.  In fact, you can have existing glasses (not with plastic
lenses) coated for about $10.  (a little more today: ed.)  Silver is the most
popular coating but there are also blue, tan, pink, etc.  The basis of this
article is my own experience with reflective sunglasses and those of others I
have interviewed. The following survival advantages are possible:<P>
    1.  DEALING WITH UNDESIRABLES: Particularly bureaucrats and other scum.
        Gives the impression that you are a psychopathic killer and prevents
        your eyes from being read.<P>
    2.  DAY TO DAY AFFAIRS: Highly reflective glasses give the impression of
        toughness, meanness, or authority.  They keep people from reading your
        emotions or second guessing your next moves.  Also, very important,
        they permit you to see behind you like wearing rear view mirrors.  You
        can observe an impending threat and not give yourself away until you
        are ready to react.<P>
    3.  OTHER ADVANTAGES: They provide good eye protection. They alter your
        appearance substantially to mislead potential witnesses.
However, highly reflective glasses do have some disadvantages:<P>
    1.  They may be too dark for night, indoor or cloudy day use.  You also
        lose some color perception.<P>
    2.  They reflect a lot of stray light from behind and above into your
        eyes, which can be distracting - even blinding.  They may not be
        satisfactory where there are a lot of street lights and lighted signs.
        The closer to the head, the more the stray light is reduced.  You
        definitely should practice wearing them in environments that you
        frequent before depending on them for a survival edge.<P>
