CYBERTEK's first issue was released in April, 1990.  CYBERTEK is a bimonthly
newsletter for those whose desire is to maximize their freedom and be able to
function as free citizens in a society which discourages and works against
those desiring liberty.  Cybertek's content consists of practical, hands-on
articles about technology, security, and self-reliance.<P>
CYBERTEK exists because its producer feels that we are sliding downward to
become more and more of a totalitarian society, and that part of the solution
to this problem is to impart knowledge and information which is essential for
people to have if they desire to exist as free citizens in a free country.  An
ignorant populace is very easy for a tyrant to keep down, but people who are
knowledgeable in the ways and means to live independently and fight
totalitarianism are impossible for despotic state to have control over.  As
James Madison, the father of the U.S.  Constitution, once said, &quot;A people to
mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge
gives.&quot;<P>
CYBERTEK's objective is the dissemination of practical, easy to understand
information about technology, security, and self-reliance. Articles in past
(as well as in future) issues dealt with such subjects as COMPUTERS, PHONES,
ELECTRONICS, ALTERNATIVE-ENERGY, WEAPONS, CHEMISTRY, SECURITY, SELF-RELIANCE,
FINANCIAL, and HEALTH.  Knowledge of these topics is necessary for anyone
seeking self-reliance and personal independence in today's world; as well as
for preparing for any &quot;unforeseen circumstances&quot;.<P>
CYBERTEK is unique from other libertarian periodicals in that it is mostly
(90%) practical, how-to type information.  We feel that enough editorializing
has been done in regard to how bad things are, and how &quot;they&quot; are going to
come and take away all the gun owners, readers of controversial literature,
and other people who are a threat to &quot;the new world order&quot;.  We figure our
readers have heard enough of that, and now they're ready for information on
how they can do something about the rising crime rate, increasingly
totalitarian government policies, worsening economy, and other problems facing
them today.  CYBERTEK's content is intended as a powerful tool to assist its
readers maintain themselves, and those close to them, in an increasingly
hostile world.<P>
CYBERTEK is published for educational purposes only under The First Amendment
of The United States Constitution.  The subject matter, while very
controversial in the eyes of some, is currently 100% legal to possess in the
United States; assuming Sarah Brady and HCI haven't yet payed off enough
congressmen to pass a law banning &quot;dangerous literature&quot;.  Although some of
the information presented in CYBERTEK could be used in an illegal manner, no
illegal acts are suggested or implied.<P>
