<CENTER><H1>The Suit</H1></CENTER>
I've been tossing apart this idea in my head for over a year.  My excitement was intense as I realized that my dream could be reality with only off-the shelf components.  <P>
I never made the thing though, not enough money to do it.  The only possible commercial market I could think of were rich William Gibson fans. <P>
I implore you to make this thing, set up an assembly line, and let me test them all.  Or better, use the finished ones.<P>
Anyways, enough <I>about</I> the idea, let me explain what I just now have titled "the suit".<P>
On the inside of the large overcoat jacket (which wouldn't work in tropicle climents) is sewn a powerful subnotebook.  The subnotebook has several filled PCMCIA slots.  A GPS located to be used in conjunction with mapping software.  A cellular phone modem adapter.<P>
In one of the pockets is a "chord" keyboard, designed for one hand.  The hand can rest comfortably inside the pocket, barely moving.  This is the input.<P>
The output lies in a product similar to Virtual Vision.  These glasses allowed one to see the outside world or concentrate on the screen.  Very dangerous to use while driving. <P>
I estimate that the peices (including the best subnotebook one could find) should cost under $20,000, including custom sewing.<P>
<H1>World inside the Suit</H1>
One could walk the streets and be on the net.  A map could overlay your position in the real world, orienting you through bus routes, mountain contours, or Tokyo city streets. <P>
Communication, if one wished, could be realtime with the entire outside world.  One to many live communication could be possible.  <P>
No one would know you were in this world of your own.<P>
Not at first anyways.<P>
Not until others joined, making their computers as portable as they.<P>
One would have a home server.  Having your full resources of your main computer with you at any time anywhere.<P>
<P>
I can't claim this idea is original.  I am surprised at how off-the-shelf the solutions can be, however.  <P>
<B>
We are slowly being sucked into a surrealistic science-fiction novel.</B>
