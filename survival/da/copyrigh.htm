I now shall restrict your license.  Tell you what you can do with this material.  Tell you how you can use it.  Tell you you can't take it apart.<P>
I shall now explain how my lawyers can beat up your lawyers.  I will now politely threaten you if you don't agree to everything I want, no matter how obtuse the demands.<P>
If you don't agree to these demands you may try to attempt to get a refund from a clueless computer salesman.<P>
These web pages have no guarantee.  If you break your leg, kill yourself, cause mental damage in yourself or others, it's not my fault.<P>
No matter what chemicals you may find on these pages, no matter <I>how</I> infected the bloody needle on the doorway to these pages, you may not sue.<P>
<P>
Seriously though.  These are ideas.  The themes presented here have been in many forms presented before.  I am flattered if your are impressed with the form my words take.<P>
If you wish to point to my web page, feel free, and mail me your web page address.<P>
If you wish to use any of this for print publication, I will most likely agree, and also email me.<P>
If you wish to pay me money, feel free to email me with your needs.<P>
