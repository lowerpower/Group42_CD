<CENTER><H1>Free Unlimited Storage</H1></CENTER>
The rough idea goes like this:<P>
Theres terra byte upon terra byte of unused hard drive space on the
internet.  This could all be harnessed!<P>
If a user could select, much as he does with a recycle bin, the 
amount of space to be dedicated to free space.<P>
For instance, I would want 20% of my unused space to be available for all.<P>
When I started to use my space up, and files needed to be moved, they
would move automatically.  They would find another machine which could
hold the data.  <P>
Essentially this is the idea of the "dynamic link" which M$ didn't put
into Win95 (but was going to).  If the pointer, or reference to the data
is notified when the data moves, everyone is happy.<P>
This looks especially appealing when relized how much "grey area" data
could exist on such virtual networks.<P>
Another advantage of this automatic storage is that the machine owners
could no presumably be liable for the information held there.  Every
computer would be a "service provider". <P>
Private data could be stored on such a network, encrypted.  Also
"underground data" (supressed and repressed information) could be disimenated
safely.  Access would be limited by the description or key distribution
(if encrypted).<P>
