<CENTER><H1>Giving away money for free - the difficult task.</H1></CENTER>


<H2>The first attempts</H2>

It started in high school, these experiments.  Zebulon (a good friend of mine I haven’t talked to lately but still is in my thoughts) and I tried to give away money.<P>
<P>
I walked into the retail store and asked the clerk if she wanted a dollar.  It is difficult to describe the litany of responses other than their reality was disturbed.  She refused, and was confused at the question.  This was entertainment of much greater than a dollar already.
<P>
We attempted to give away dollars to strangers in the street.  They generally wanted to know what the catch was, were very distrustful.  
<P>
<H2>The unscientific experiment</H2>

We had probably attempted over ten people with none accepting.  We wanted to know who would take the money.  Money!  The prized glorious object of desire.  The worshipped dollar.  The revered dollar.  And we couldn’t give it away for free.
<P>
We found out that people in stores and well off people would never take the money.  People in our high school and of our own age took a few dollars.  
<P>
<H2>How distress a bank teller</H2>
<P>
In the ultimate level of discomfort, attacks upon realities, we attempted to give money to a bank teller.  This, my friends, is a powerful spell - use it sparingly.
<P>
The bank teller is trapped.  They cannot put the money in their pockets.  They cannot put the money in the till.  They can’t leave the money on the counter.  Their world is that of balances, and exact amounts, the holy counters of the worshipped exchange.  To disrespect the dollar in such a way is sacrilege,  but only vaguely so.
<P>
Their panic should not be invoked without thought.  It takes guts and a good attitude - they will feel threatened.
<P>
A tip is the best answer for awful bank service.
<P>
<H2>Money is worthless</H2>

Well, if everyone beleived this, it would be so.  Giving away money breaks a consensual mass hallucination.  It makes people uncomfortable, defensive, or utterly confused.  
<P>
The gold standard is gone.  The silver standard is gone.  There is nothing backing our money. 
<P>
I’m not saying that we shouldn’t still save money, and be careful with our use of money.  It is the medium of exchange in our consensual hallucination.  To treat money as if it is not holy, to give it away unprovoked, is a great shock.
<P>
Try this at work, at school, with friends, at businesses, on the street.  You won’t be disappointed, and will get every penny’s worth in entertainment.
