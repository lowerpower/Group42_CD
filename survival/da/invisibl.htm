<H2>History of a box that doesn’t exist</H2>
I wrote this file over four years ago.  It appeared in <i>NSA (national security anarchists)</i> issue four.  When I wrote it, it was the first article for the NSA newsletter, and appeared along with "QSD is the place to be". <P>

While it was fun to write, and I got a lot of positive feedback from other NSA members (if your friends can’t say good things about you, quit now - or find new friends).  <P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="gail.jpg">
About a month or two after this appeared Mind Rape, editor of NSA got busted.  Along with all his incriminating evidence, all of issue 5 was confiscated.  According to him it was mostly done.  This was the last issue MR worked on, and his career in the CU press was finished (although he’s made noises about starting to write again).<P>

It is my understanding that this document was used in court.  The prosecutors (including Gail Thackery, I would assume) apparently took this document VERY seriously.  Perhaps they didn’t read the context of the article - an introduction to "The serious side of hacking" is right before it, explaining my non-tech poetry satire and fluff.<P>
At the time, the 50Mhz 486 hadn’t been released.  The software (obviously) was never released, we relished the thought of everyone looking everywhere for it.  At least the dupes.  All in good fun.  <P>

MR pointed this out to his lawyer, who laughed his public-defending ass off.  I heard the story a few months ago, and was tickled pink.  <P>

                                An Introduction<BR>
</CENTER>
  A friend of mine who is both an electrician and a phone technician has had no
  contact with the computer underground, and yet has managed to design and
  produce several incredible boxes that never have been released.  This dear
  soul was kind enough to take me under his wing and show me some of his
  incredible inventions.  Luckily for all of us he was not only interested in
  saving some money (he too abhors the idea of paying for ANY phone call), but
  had a healthy interest in anarchy as well.  The INVISIBLE box I am about to
  describe is SO incredible it makes the blotto box look like the DONUTHIN box
  (to be released at a later time in this series).<P>


  <B>DISCLAIMER</B>: Important! This file was DESIGNED to ENCOURAGE others to break
              laws, commit anarchy, and create havoc.  If you have NO intention
              of doing all of the above please do NOT read this.  I however
              will take NO responsibility for the MANY laws I hope I to
              encourage you to break.<P>


<B>  USAGE:</B>

    Essentially this is an improved blotto box.  But the blotto box, as we know
    was bullshit, this WORKS! (I have, um, er, friends that have told me so, I
    would NEVER break any laws myself).  Through the use of the RS232 port on
    your 50mhz IBM compatible we will show you how to destroy ANY, I repeat ANY
    area code you wish to destroy.  I know this sounds incredulous but there is
    an essential flaw in the surge protect system that is installed around the
    country. (This system is the reason that the blotto box did not work and
    was bullshit).  One of the incredible features that this box has is that it
    is IMPOSSIBLE to trace with existing current technology.<P>


<B>WHAT MAKES THIS BOX POSSIBLE:</B>
<P>
  The flaw with the infamous blotto box is that it tried to instantly fry the
  area code (another flaw is that it tried to kill the area code that you were
  IN).  The INVISIBLE box slowly builds up voltage in the remote target until
  the required voltage is established, then discharches just enough voltage to
  create a spike to demolish an area code.<P>


<B>MATERIALS NEEDED:</B>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Honda Generator:
             Note: (hey, WOW, they DID get SOMETHING right on that blotto
                   bullshit)
<LI>How to obtain: Rent (this costs a bit, so stay with me)
                   Steal! (preferred method)

<LI>486 50mhz IBM Compatible: Why all this power?  One of the reasons that this
                            has not been done before is that there is not
                            enough speed to properly kill off area codes with a
                            wimply 486 25mhz, so we have to use a 50mhz
                            machine.
             How to obtain: Again, NSA STRONGLY recommends that you steal one
                            of these. (the chair-through-the-window-technique
                            is suggested).

                  The National Security Anarchists Release Of<BR>
       "Area Sucking, Smashing Heroific Osculator: Lancaster Engineered"<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>  I know the title is a bit of a mouthful, but the writer of the program (my
  friend I was telling you about) insisted, so NSA finally gave in, and
  released it under that name. This program has already been released to the
  general public, and can be found on ANY worthwhile H/P/A/C/V/K/W board in the
  country.
<P>
  The interface between the components has been explained in detail with the
  docs to that accompany the program. (we tried to think of an acronym for the
  program, but were at a loss).
<P>
  Well I guess thats pretty much it.  I would explain how to use the program,
  but it is SO painfully obvious once you load it in, I would feel like an
  idiot spending precious disk space explaining it here.
<P>
  NOTES: I would like to thank my friend (Lancaster) for thoughtfully
         engineering this, and taking the time and energy to write the program
         (he spent four LONG months doing so).  I would also like to announce
         with pride that this program is now Windows compatible, and soon will
         be released for various other systems depending on the hardware that
         is currently available on some systems.  Thank you, and happy area
         code killing.
