<H2>Illegal Shareware for Non-Electronic Medium</H2>
<H3>Purpose:</H3>
In the community of the network, there is a deep craving to allow traditional 
non-electronic medium to be accessable via the net.  Books, newspaper 
articles, poetry, visual arts, music, video, and other mediums are all in 
great demand.<P>

One of the problems that faces the artist who wishes to be more widely 
accessable he doesn't necessarily own the rights to his materials. Or that 
there is red tape, a lack of technical expertise, or ignorance of the 
net.  It is the intention of Isnem to address these problems. <P>

By distributing all media, and attatching an Isnem license to the medium, 
we create an illicit press that gets materials out into the world.  The 
license is fairly simple.  If like the media, simply send cash or money 
order or a check to the artist for the amount suggested on the release.  The 
way we are coming up with our rates is fairly simple.  We try to figure 
how much profit the author would make from the sale of each copy in a 
legitimate market.  For instance, if a musical artist makes a 10 song
albume, and makes 2 dollars per sale, each song would cost about 20 cents. <P>

We *urge* people who participate in enjoying the media to pay their 
shareware fee.  The artist benefits, the middle-man of the publisher 
is eliminated, and the netizens have access to a wide variety of materials. <P>

<H2>Membership:</H2>
We do not view this as an organization...  There is no membership, per se.  
Anyone who puts material on the net, and contributes to this project is a 
member.<P>

We have made a list of possible places people could participate:
<UL>
<LI>Scanning in books.   Requires scanner prefereably w/ document feeder
<LI>Typing in newspaper articles. requires typing ability
<LI>Proofreading unproofread contributed materials.  Requires proofreading skills
<LI>Capturing video footage. Requires video capture card, ISDN or better bandwidth probably.
<LI>Capturing audio footage. Requires high-end sound card, 16 bit
<LI>Providing ftp or fsp sites. Requires continuous net connectioon, risk of getting caught
<LI>scanning in artwork.  Requires high-end color scanner
</UL>
<P>
There are also possible ways to contribute to Isnem, feel free to add 
any creative ideas.  We'll have updated .NFO's on our distribution sites.
We will also have a suggestion upload directory, as well as a 
material upload directories, so anyone can upload anything. <P>

Concerning artwork:  We frown upon pornography for a couple of reasons.<BR>
<UL>
<LI> the distribution system for pornography is already well established
<LI> adult magazines are already aware of electronic piracy and are actively involved with stopping it. <P>
</UL>
Detailed Liscenes will be available up the Isnem fsp or ftp sites
Most likelly the licenses will vary from: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>painting/picture
<LI>song
<LI>albume
<LI>book
<LI>video media
</UL>
<BR>
One of the important jobs of the data importers is to completely fill
in the information concerning the author.  Including an address where 
they can be sent the money.  It is preferable that this would not be the 
publisher, but their home address.<P>
If you wish to either contribute to the project, or use the fruits of the 
project, we'd like to welcome you aboard.<P>
