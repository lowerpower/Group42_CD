<CENTER><H1>Shadowlands</H1></CENTER>

The land between the conscious and the unconscious.<P>

The robot structure of daily lives does not facilitate the
awareness of the shadowlands.<P>

It is the dim reality of half-waking, half-dreaming.  aware
that there is an outside world,  but refusing it.  the
distant hum of reality, the day that must be faced intruding upon.<P>

Also, but not as distinctly, going back to sleep.  the 
gradual shift from conscious to unconscious.<P>

What is consciousness?  as far as I can concretely determine 
while still using words that make sense (and ideas that have 
content) it is the period in which our memory operates.<P>

Yes, we remember dreams, but not as our own actions.  dreams are different.<P>

dreams are the memories of the shadowlands.<P>

the phrase came to me as I was drifting off to sleep, or trying
to...  the orderly thoughts that prevented my drift.  the drift
I willed o-so-hard, but which would not come.<P>

The order was too strong... into the shadowlands I notice my grip
upon my own thoughts loosening, order dissolving, chaos imposing.
When the chaos reigns -those mental lists, the constant assessments,
and the internal conversation, then the unconscious begins.<P>

and we walk into the shadowlands.<P>

and what's there, what kind of place is the shadowlands?<P>

my experience is personal.  I know not what the dreams of others
are made.  I've heard them recounted to me, as best as words allow
for the recollected, but this is hearsay.  I've heard stories of 
dreams come true, mirrors of realities they've later met.  this too
is hearsay.<P>

the following however is not hearsay, until of course you yourself
relate it to another.  <P>

I was eight maybe, maybe nine.  The dream was a vivid one, and I 
remembered much of it.  My mother and I talked about it:<P>
<PRE>
  a scene in which I saw a large plate, a silver
  plate, with a cover.  an ornate butler perhaps, perhaps
  not.  the cover is removed and has water in it, filled
  to where the cover once went.  there were vegetables in
  it too, I believe.
</PRE>
Her thought was that I should drink more water.  This didn't
 seem right, and also seemed to fit what I perceived (or I think I did 
(in a nine year old mentality) ) to be "what she wants me to think". 
Perhaps that was true.  I don't begrudge of it her now - water's good 
for you.<P>

There was another scene though:<P>
<PRE>
  It was some sort of shoot-out, an old west setting the
  entire dream had.  I looked down at my hand.  My right
  thumb "flapped" open to reveal my innards.
</PRE>
Less than a month after that incident I slammed a car door into my hand (My
mothers husband alway told me not to slam the door) and I looked
down - my right index finger was "flapped" open, in the exact
same manner.  Immediately I recalled my dream.<P>

Another instance I was in a dream, I did not understand, and could
not explain it.  I could and can only use metaphors to describe it. 
I was about ten or so years old:<P>
<PRE>
    I was in a maze, not really a maze...  I had a goal, I
    was trying to get to a certain place,  to navigate.
    but it wasn't directions, more.. Colors! Maybe, but
    that's closer than space...  I remember it was real
    difficult, and it was real important that I get to the
    object.  I was scared.  I was running, running, screaming.
    My dream ended.
</PRE>
I was outside my room, outside our apartment, across a bridge, returning
 home.  I had been running, I had been screaming.  Screaming at the top
of my lungs to our apartment complex, in the middle of the night.<P>

I saw that maze again, New Years 1995.  Again it scared me, as I wasn't
in 'normal consciousness', but I realized the nature of the maze more.
I knew that my comprehension of the space was in the shadowlands, I
 only have the memories of knowing more.<P>
