<H1><P>Travelling in america during ‘the seaon’<P></H1>
perpetual strip malls<BR>
clone gelry eye, identical<BR>
clerks differ 0only in accent<BR>
mall culture allows commercialized<BR>
pre-puberty fashion magnets<BR>
to appear identical<BR>
<P>
not to say places don’t<BR>
have real differences<BR>
<P>
if fashion were software <BR>
warm shirt v3.6 localized<BR>
grunge would be the current rage<BR>
<P>
long bus trips are different than short<BR>
the unspoken rules<BR>
of public conduct<BR>
forbidding conversations<BR>
 - yes real conversations<BR>
is tenuously halted<BR>
<P>
halted with anecdotal stories<BR>
that start with travel plans, <BR>
and end with life stories<BR>
<P>
all voluntary, such fleeting, <BR>
albeit at times boring<BR>
glimpses into strangers souls<BR>
come if you wish it<BR>
or comes against the will only if wished<BR>
<P>
denny’s everywhere<BR>
chains of familiarity<BR>
k-mart<BR>
7-11<BR>
IHOP<BR>
<P>
national standard interface on shopping<BR>
<P>
they’ll keep feeding us shit as long as we buy it<BR>
<P>
long lines synchronically appearing all across America<BR>
indistinguishable malls preparing for the profit season<BR>
<P>
long lines of children unwillingly <BR>
being forced into the semi-employed<BR>
semi-alcoholic Santas’ laps<BR>
<P>
while parents take notes to rush<BR>
and buy the overpriced plastic<BR>
whose brand is embedded in children’s heads<BR>
<P>
forcing purchases that cannot be stopped<BR>
<P>
cynicism doesn’t forestall spending<BR>
only increases it to a frenzy pace that cannot be afforded<BR>
<P>
brands embedded all over the country<BR>
effective advertising recanted to apathetic yet hard Santas<BR>
everywhere -<BR>
ritualistically<BR>
<P>
greed carefully taught by parents<BR>
who spend money they don’t have<BR>
on things they don’t need - <BR>
thinking -<BR>
as naively as the children, <BR>
and even less realistically<BR>
that happiness will ensue<BR>
<P>
media myths of brand popularity<BR>
are as ancient self-fulfilling prophesies<BR>
<P>
these snake-oil pitchers are college educated<BR>
believing their own lies<BR>
or disbelieving in truth altogether<BR>
<P>
four out of five actors prefer our lies over our competitors<BR>
our lies brighten your teeth<BR>
while the pleasant taste of sugar mint makes crack taste fresher<BR>
<P>
snort pixi stix to make your skin younger looking, smile wider<BR>
your friends will notice<BR>
