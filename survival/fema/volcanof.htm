<TITLE>FEMA: FACT SHEET--VOLCANOES</TITLE>
<H1><B>FACT SHEET: VOLCANOES</B></H1><P>
Volcanic eruptions can hurl hot rocks for at least 20 miles.  Floods, airborne ash, or noxious fumes can spread 100 miles or more.  If you live near a known volcano, active or dormant, be ready to evacuate at a moment's notice.<P>

<B>Make evacuation plans.</B><BR>
You want to get to high ground away from the eruption.  Plan a route out and have a backup route in mind.<P>
<B>Develop an emergency communication plan.</B><BR>
In case family members are separated from one another during a volcanic eruption (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), have a plan for getting back together.<P>
Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the "family contact."  After a disaster, it's often easier to call long distance.  Make sure everyone knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person.<P>

<B>Evacuation</B><P>
Although it may seem safe to stay at home and wait out an eruption, doing so could be very dangerous.  The rock debris from a volcano can break windows and set buildings on fire.  Stay safe.  Follow authorities' instructions and leave the area before the disaster begins.<P>
<h4>DURING</h4><P>
<B>Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities.</B><P>
<B>Avoid areas downwind of the volcano.</B><P>
<B>If caught indoors:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Close all windows, doors, and dampers.
<LI>Put all machinery inside a garage or barn.
<LI>Bring animals and livestock into closed shelters.
</UL><P>
<B>If trapped outdoors:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Seek shelter indoors.
<LI>If caught in a rockfall, roll into a ball to protect head.
<LI>Avoid low-lying area where poisonous gases can collect and flash floods can be most dangerous.
<LI>If caught near a stream, beware of mudflows.
</UL><P>
<B>Protect yourself:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Wear long sleeved shirts and pants.
<LI>Use goggles to protect eyes.
<LI>Use a dust-mask or hold a damp cloth over face to help breathing.
<LI>Keep car or truck engines off.
</UL><P>
<B>Stay out of the area.</B><BR>
A lateral blast of a volcano can travel many miles from the mountain. Trying to watch an erupting volcano is a deadly idea.<P>
<h4>Mudflows</h4><P>
Mudflows are powerful "rivers" of mud that can move faster than people can walk or run.  Mudflows occur when rain falls through ash-carrying clouds or when rivers are damed during an eruption.  They are most dangerous close to stream channels.  When you approach a bridge, first look upstream.  If a mudflow is approaching or moving beneath the bridge, do not cross the bridge.  The power of the mudflow can destroy a bridge very quickly.<P>
<h4>AFTER</h4><P>
<B>Listen to a battery-powered radio or television for the latest emergency information.</B><P>
<B>Stay away from volcanic ashfall.</B><P>
<B>When outside:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Cover your mouths and nose.  A number of victims of the Mount St. Helens volcano died from inhaling ash.
<LI>Wear goggles to protect your eyes.
<LI>Keep skin covered to avoid irritation or burns.
</UL><P>
<B>If you have a respiratory ailment, avoid contact with any amount of ash.  Stay indoors until local health officials advise it is safe to go outside.</B><P>
<B>Avoid driving in heavy ashfall.</B><BR>
Driving will stir up more ash that can clog engines and stall vehicles.<P>
<B>Clear roofs of ashfall.</B><BR>
Ashfall is very heavy and can cause buildings to collapse.<P>
<B>Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance--infants,
elderly people, and people with disabilities.</B><P>
