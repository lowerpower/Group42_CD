<H1><B>FACT SHEET:  WILDLAND FIRES </B></H1><P>
The threat of wildland fires for people living near wildland areas or using recreational facilities in wilderness areas is real.  Advance planning and knowing how to protect buildings in these areas can lessen the devastation of a wildland fire.<P>
<h4>BEFORE</h4><P>
<B>Learn and teach safe fire practices.</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Build fires away from nearby trees or bushes.
<LI>Always have a way to extinguish the fire quickly and completely.
<LI>Never leave a fire--even a cigarette--burning unattented.
</UL><P>
<B>Obtain local building codes and weed abatement ordinances for structures built near wooded areas.</B><P>
<B>Use fire-resistant materials when building, renovating, or retrofitting structures.</B><P>
<B>Create a safety zone to separate the home from combustible plants and vegetation.</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>tone walls can act as heat shields and deflect flames.
<LI>Swimming pools and patios can be a safety zone.
</UL><P>
<B>Check for fire hazards around home.</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Install electrical lines underground, if possible.  Keep all tree and shrub limbs trimmed so they don't come in contact with the wires.
<LI>Prune all branches around the residence to a height of 8 to 10 feet.  Keep trees adjacent to buildings free of dead or dying wood and moss.
<LI>Remove all dead limbs, needles, and debris from rain gutters.
<LI>Store combustible or flammable materials in approved safety containers and keep them away from the house.
<LI>Keep chimney clean.
<LI>Avoid open burning completely, and especially during dry season.
</UL><P>
<B>Install smoke detectors on every level of your home and near sleeping areas.</B><P>
<B>Make evacuation plans.</B><BR>
Plan several routes in case the fire blocks escape route.<P>
<B>Have disaster supplies on hand</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>lashlight with extra batteries
<LI>Portable, battery-operated radio and extra batteries
<LI>First aid kit and manual
<LI>Emergency food and water
<LI>Nonelectric can opener
<LI>Essential medicines
<LI>Cash and credit cards
<LI>Sturdy shoes
</UL><P>
<B>Develop an emergency communication plan.</B><BR>
In case family members are separated from one another during a wildland fire (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), have a plan for getting back together.<P>
Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the "family contact."  After a disaster, it's often easier to call long distance.  Make sure everyone knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person.<P>
<B>Fire-Resistant Building Materials</B><P>
Avoid using wooden shakes and shingles for a roof.  Use tile, stucco, metal siding, brick, concrete block, rock, or other fire-resistant materials. Use only thick, tempered safety glass in large windows and sliding glass doors.<P>
<B>Contact your local emergency management office or American Red Cross chapter for more information on wildland fires.</B>
<h4>DURING</h4><P>

<B>If Trapped in a Wildland Fire</B><BR>
You cannot outrun a fire.  Crouch in a pond or river.  Cover head and upper body with wet clothing.  If water is not around, look for shelter in a cleared area or among a bed of rocks.  Lie flat and cover body with wet clothing or soil. <P>
Breathe the air close to the ground through a wet cloth to avoid scorching lungs or inhaling smoke.<P>
<h4>Mitigation</h4><P>
Mitigation includes any activities that prevent an emergency, reduce the chance of an emergency happening, or lessen the damaging effects of unavoidable emergencies.  Investing in preventive mitigation steps now such as installing a spark arrestor on your chimney, cleaning roof surfaces and gutters regularly, and using only fire resistant materials on the exterior of your home, will help reduce the impact of wildland fires in the future.  For more information on mitigation, contact your local emergency management office.<P>
