<H4>
The leading cause of death during winter storms is transportation accidents. 
Preparing your vehicle for the winter season and knowing how to react if
stranded or lost on the road are the keys to safe winter driving.<P>


<B>BEFORE</B><P>

<B>Have a mechanic check the following items on your car.
</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Battery
<LI>Antifreeze

<LI>Oil level (if necessary, replace existing oil with a winter grade oil or the
SAE 10w/30 weight variety)
</UL><P>
<B>Install good winter tires.</B><BR>
Make sure the tires have adequate tread.  All-weather radials are usually 
adequate for most winter conditions.  However, some jurisdictions require that
to drive on their roads, vehicles must be equipped with chains or snow tires
with studs.<P>

<B>Keep a windshield scraper and small broom for ice and snow removal.</B><P>

<B>Maintain at least a half tank of gas during the winter season.</B><P>

<B>Plan long trips carefully.</B><BR>
Listen to the radio or call the state highway patrol for the latest road 
conditions.  Always travel during daylight and, if possible, take at least one
other person.<P>

<B>If you must go out during a winter storm, use public transportation.</B><P>

<B>Dress warmly.</B><BR>
Wear layered of loose-fitting, layered, lightweight clothing.<P>

<B>Carry food and water.</B><BR>
Store a supply of high energy "munchies" and several bottles of water.<P>

<B>Contact your local emergency management office or American Red Cross chapter
for more information on winter driving.

<B>DURING</B><P>

<B>IF TRAPPED IN CAR DURING A BLIZZARD</B><P>

<B>Stay in the car.</B><BR>
Do not leave the car to search for assistance unless help is visible within 100
yards.  You may become disoriented and lost is blowing and drifting snow.<P>

<B>Display a trouble sign.</B><BR>
Hang a brightly colored cloth on the radio antenna and raise the hood.<P>

<B>Occasionally run engine to keep warm.</B><BR>
Turn on the car's engine for about 10 minutes each hour.  Run the heater when 
the car is running.  Also, turn on the car's dome light when the car is running.<P>

<I>Beware of carbon monoxide poisoning.</I>  Keep the exhaust pipe clear of snow, and 
open a downwind window slightly for ventilation.<P>

<B>Watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia.</B><P>

<B>Do minor exercises to keep up circulation.</B><P>

<B>Clap hands and move arms and legs occasionally.  Try not to stay in one 
position for too long.
</B>
<B>If more than one person is in the car, take turns sleeping.</B><P>

<B>For warmth, huddle together.</B><P>

<B>Use newspapers, maps, and even the removable car mats for added insulation.</B><P>

<B>Avoid overexertion.</B><BR>
Cold weather puts an added strain on the heart.  Unaccustomed exercise such as
shoveling snow or pushing a car can bring on a heart attack or make other 
medical conditions worse.  Be aware of symptoms of dehydration.<P>

<B>Wind Chill</B><BR>
<I>"Wind chill" is a calculation of how cold it feels outside when the effects of
temperature and wind speed are combined.  A strong wind combined with a 
temperature of just below freezing can have the same effect as a still air
temperature about 35 degrees colder.</I>

<B>Winter Storm Watches and Warnings</B><BR>
A winter storm watch indicates that severe winter weather may affect your 
area.  A winter storm warning indicates that severe winter weather conditions
are definitely on the way.<P>

A blizzard warning means that large amounts of falling or blowing snow and
sustained winds of at least 35 miles per hour are expected for several hours.<P>


<B>Frostbite and Hypothermia</B><BR>

Frostbite is a severe reaction to cold exposure that can permanently damage
its victims.  A loss of feeling and a white or pale appearance in fingers, toes, 
or nose and ear lobes are symptoms of frostbite.<P>

Hypothermia is a condition brought on when the body temperature drops to less
than 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  Symptoms of hypothermia include uncontrollable
shivering, slow speech, memory lapses, frequent stumbling, drowsiness, and
exhaustion.<P>

If frostbite or hypothermia is suspected, begin warming the person slowly and
seek immediate medical assistance.  Warm the person's trunk first.  Use your
won body heat to help.  Arms and legs should be warmed last because stimulation
of the limbs can drive cold blood toward the heart and lead to heart failure.<P>

Put person in dry clothing and wrap their entire body in a blanket.<P>

Never give a frostbite or hypothermia victim something with caffeine in it
(like coffee or tea) or alcohol.  Caffeine, a stimulant, can cause the heart
to beat faster and hasten the effects the cold has on the body.  Alcohol, a
depressant, can slow the heart and also hasten the ill effects of cold body
temperatures.<P>
