<H1><A NAME="Abstract">Abstract</A></H1>
<P>The term Information Warfare is widely used in today's news. Often, it is
misinterpreted and points  to high-tech weapons which are used in mass armies.</P>
<P>
 Information Warfare is defined by:</P>
<P>

<B>Actions taken to achieve information superiority by affecting adversary 
information, information based processes, and information systems, while
defending  ones own information, information based processes and information
systems.</B></P>
<P>
 The history of warfare is described in three waves. During the agrarian
revolution, warfare was  fought by a warrior class based on information. With
the industrial revolution, the war changed to  mass destruction. Nation states
used mass armies to protect and expand their societies through  wars with high
casualties. In the information age, warfare changes to Information War. The 
ultimate destructive capability is no longer mass destruction but critical data
deletion. Information  attacks with minimal casualties are characterizing the
war.</P>
<P>
 On the battlefield, information technology is still used today mainly to make
weapons smarter and  to minimize one's own casualties with providing the troops
with third wave technology in second  wave weapon system. The actual doctrine is
AirLand battle and the command structure is  Command, Control, Communication and
Information (C3I) or with adding Computer (C4I).</P>
<P>
Soft War is used to demoralize enemy troops by sending wrong information and
morphed TV  programs to them. </P>
<P>
 Possible Information Warfare Weapons are used (or at least could be used) by
modern armies as  well as by terrorists. They are for example:</P>
<UL><P>
  Computer Viruses</P>
<P>
  Worms</P>
<P>
  Trojan Horses</P>
<P>
  Logic Bombs</P>
<P>
  Trap Doors</P>
<P>
  Chipping</P>
<P>
  Nano Machines and Microbes</P>
<P>
  Electronic Jamming</P>
<P>
  HERF Guns - EMP Bombs</P></UL>
<P>
 Information Warfare is developed by high-tech societies and armies. The
Information Warfare  weapons can only be used against an enemy which has also
similar high-tech capabilities. The use  against first or second wave armies is
limited. Information Warfare can also be used in terrorist  actions against an
information society without exposing the terrorists themselves to danger as they
 can cause severe damage with remote actions.</P>

<H1><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H1>
<P>Today's news is overwhelmed with information on the latest breakthroughs in
communications, the  Information Superhighway (easier said, the Internet),
Cyberwar, and Information Warfare.   Soldiers are shown with &quot;Star Wars&quot;
equipment fighting on the battlefield, and the News is  broadcasting this &quot;information&quot;
all over the world. </P>
<P>
This paper was written as a term project for Dr. Lance Hoffman's class &quot;Computer
Security  Systems I&quot; at The George Washington University in Washington
D.C.. In this paper, I define  &quot;real&quot; Information Warfare (IW) and
show how IW is or could be used in the present or in the  near future. I wrote
this paper with a target audience of non technical readers in mind. The paper 
will provide an introduction to Information Warfare to everyone who is
interested in this field and  link the experienced reader to supplementary
documentation.</P>
<P>
</P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="What">What is Information Warfare</A></H1>
<H2>Definition</H2>
<P>One of the problems with Information Warfare (IW) is that there is still no
official, definition. The  main reason is that this kind of warfare is
relatively new and that the term IW has many different  meanings. On one hand,
there is the military aspect of it, but on the other hand, IW is also used to 
describe the &quot;war&quot; on the Internet.</P>
<P>
 My preferred technical description of Information Warfare was given by Dr. John
Alger <A HREF="#Alger">[1]</A>, at a  seminar on Information Warfare. He
described IW as:</P>
<P>

<B>Actions taken to achieve information superiority by affecting adversary 
information, information based processes, and information systems, while
defending  ones own information, information based processes and information
systems.</B></P>
<P>
 This definition can be used for both fields which I mentioned above, while the
following definition  from the Department of Defense (DoD) covers &quot;only&quot;
the military part:</P>
<P>

<B><I>Information Warfare - </I>Actions taken to achieve information
superiority in  support of national military strategy by affecting adversary
information and  information systems while leveraging and defending our
information and  systems.</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>A practical description</H2>
<P>In his book <I>Information Warfare</I>, Winn Schwartau <A HREF="#Alger">[8]</A> describes a
different way to define  Information Warfare. He does not try to define all
levels of IW in one and the same description,  but he split the definition into
the following three classes:</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Class1: Personal Information Warfare</H3>
<P>The first class describes attacks against an individual's electronic
privacy. This includes the  disclosure of digital records and database entries
wherever information is stored. The average  person today has little control
over the information stored. We cannot control the amount of  information
concerning us even if it is correct or not. According to a USA Today poll, 78%
of  Americans are concerned about the loss of privacy <A HREF="#Alger">[8]</A>. </P>
<P>
 In the past, a spy had to tap phone lines and had to use miniature cameras and
microphones to get  desired information about a person. Today, he still has the
capability to use this utilities (which are  more miniaturized and easier to use
than ever) but most of the information about a person will be  available in
existing databases. To blackmail someone, it is no longer necessary to survey
him/her  for months, today's Information Warrior gets the desired information
with the help of a computer  over the telephone line. </P>
<P>
Do we have to be concerned about information that get public? To be honest, most
of us do not  want that the credit card bills, bank account numbers, financial
transactions such as loans, video  rentals, medical history, emergency room
services, prescriptions, criminal offenses, arrests, court  records and other
information printed in the newspapers, spread to our friends or distributed over
 the world on the Internet. Worse, if someone provides private information, who
says that this  information has to be true? You can spend a lifetime denying
published information where no one  takes the responsibility for the integrity
of the data.</P>
<P>
 This is the first approach to class 1 warfare, but it can easily become worse.
As we saw in the  movie <I>The Net</I> with Sandra Bullock, we strong rely on
the information about us. If  someone is able to edit information in law
enforcement databases, how would you explain to a  police officer that the
credit card you used is not stolen, that your passport is not faked, that your 
real name is not Juan Garcia, that you never smuggled drugs and did not kill
three people and that  you are not wanted all over the world by Interpol if the
computer in the car of the patrolman,  which you called because someone sold
your house during your holidays, says so. </P>
<P>
 Put together, we can say:</P>
<UL><P>
   Thousands of databases hold together the digital images of our lives.</P>
<P>
  Computers constantly exchange information about each of us.</P>
<P>
  Available information does not have to be correct</P>
<P>
  Getting erroneous information corrected is almost impossible</P></UL>
<P>
 Class 1 Information Warfare does not seem to be a potential threat but can
easily destroy  someone's identity or even link to class 2 or even class 3
Information Warfare.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Class2: Corporate Information Warfare</H3>
<P>This class describes competition, or better said, today's war between
corporations around the  world. </P>
<P>
It is easy to imagine that a company could invest $ 1M in a system that allows
them to break into a  competitors database and copy research results worth over
$ 15 M. To make sure that the  competitor will not be the first on the market
with the new product, they could also destroy the  original database on the fly
and make it look like a possible accident with a virus on the  mainframe. </P>
<P>
 This description of corporate information warfare is not new. This kind of &quot;espionage&quot;
is well  known from the cold war where Russian and American spies tried to
gather information about  each others nation. </P>
<P>
 Today, corporate information warfare has a new dimension. Not only can one
corporation try to  get the research results of a competitor, states became
involved in this &quot;game&quot;. It is possible that a  state encourages
students to study abroad (e.g. in the United States) and asks them to keep an
eye  open, not only to the lectures at the University but also to work as
interns in US corporations and  give the information back to their government.</P>
<P>
 Class 2 Information Warfare is not only about the acquisition of information,
it is also possible to  spread information, real or fictious. The possibility
that a drug competitor corporation (or a  foreign government with its own
chemical production in their country) spreads the information  that the widely
used ABC drug against asthma by the US corporation X causes significant lung 
cancer, the doctors will probably stop with the prescription of ABC until a
study will be published.  This study could be fake and part of a whole campaign
of well-designed desinformation. The  damage is made and millions of dollars for
the X corporation is lost until they can prove (if they  can) that their product
is OK.</P>
<P>
 This previous example uses a drug manufacturer. In today's world, many
processes are controlled  by computer chips. It would be even easier for an IC
manufacturer to claim that the widely used  chip by their competitors does not
work as it should. Would you buy a car with an airbag where it  was written in
the newspapers that the chip that controls the airbag does not work properly in 
40% of all cases? How will the company prove contrary? You cannot test the
system easily by  yourself if it functions, you have to trust the manufacturer.
If a corporation looses the trust of their  customer, they also lose millions of
dollars.</P>
<P>
 Also class 2 warfare can cause global changes. What if, for example, Jennifer
Flowers announced  her complaint against Bill Clinton not months before his
election but only a few day before the  Democratic National Convention? US
history and it's influence on world's history could have  changed  
</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3>Class 3: Global Information Warfare</H3>
<P>This type of Warfare works against industries, global economical forces or
against entire countries  or states. It is not any more sneaking in Research
data of a competitor but about the theft of  secrets and then turning this
information against its owners. </P>
<P>
 In this class, you can multiply the power of class 1 and class 2 warfare by a
large factor and still  not be able to imagine all the damage that can be done
within global information warfare. Here,  money and personal are not the
critical factor. Second and third world countries are spending  billions of
dollars every year in airplanes, bombs and bullets. What if a country decides
that they  will spend only a tenth of its yearly expenses for second wave
weapons (see <A HREF="#Alger">[11]</A> or the following  chapter) in third wave weapons. As an
example, a dictator in the South East could about 200  million dollars a year in
third wave weapons and be able within about three years to damage the  US
industry and government in an unimaginable way. In relation to traditional
weapons,  Information Warfare opens new horizons of cost effectiveness for
terrorists or enemy  governments. Class three warfare enables attacks over ten
thousands of miles with dramatic  effects. With the weapons described in one of
the following sections of this paper, the described  dictator would be able to
crash Wall Street, shut down the banking system of the US; then the last  wall
street crash will look harmless in comparison to the effects that would follow.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="History">History of Warfare</A></H1>
<P>In their book <I>War And Anti War</I> <A HREF="#Alger">[11]</A>, Alvin and Heidi Toffler
approach the history of  warfare using a model of three waves. The following
sections briefly discuss these three waves.</P>
<P>

</P>
<H2>Agrarian wave</H2>
<P>The agricultural revolution started the first great wave of change in our
history. It led to the first  of today's known societies. Agriculture enables
communities to produce economic products which  in that age were athe cause of
many wars. The link between war and soil was close at this time.  The people
were kept ignorant by their statesman to keep them focused on farming and
warfare.  The soldiers were occupied for the most time of the year with working
on the fields. Volunteer  soldiers came mainly from farms which did allow them
to be absent during the winter months. The  harvest called back the soldiers so
that only a month or two were left where these farmers could  find time to
fight. The armies were mainly poorly organized and equipped. There were also few
 exceptions to this rule. The example of a strongly led and equipped army is
surely the Roman  legions in their heyday. </P>
<P>
In most First Wave armies, the soldiers pay was irregular and low. They were
paid usually in kind  rather than money. The pay of a soldier in the Roman army
after a lifetime warfare was usually a  little parcel of land somewhere.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Industrial wave</H2>
<P>The industrial Revolution changed the way wars were fought. The element of
mass production  introduced weapons of mass destruction (nuclear and chemical).
The mass armies were not loyal  to the landowners but to modern nation states
which were paying the soldiers. The change from  one wave to the other did not
happen in a short period but, similar to the industry, took its time to  change
the warfare. During the transition period, a few wars were actually fought with
both types  of armies. A good example is the American Civil War (1862-63) where
the industrialized North  defeated the agrarian South. The big change in warfare
was indicated by the manufacture of  standardized arms like musketes with
bayonets and their accessories. The parts became  interchangeable and the
industry acted quickly to the needs on the battlefield. Standardization was  not
only used to produce weapons themselves, but was also applied to military
training,  organization and doctrine. Like in business, armies developed general
staffs and also the orders  changed from oral commands to written commands like
memos, as used in business. Mechanized  warfare was then only a logical step in
this evolution to dramatically increase firepower and to  change the doctrine.
</P>
<P>
World War II exposed the disastrous way of fighting mass destruction warfare.
Not only that  millions of men fought in this war but also 15 million soldiers
were killed during this period. The  Nazis killed 6 million Jews <A HREF="#Alger">[11]</A> in factory
style. Therefore, mass destruction was used on the field  even before the first
nuclear bomb exploded over Hiroshima. </P>
<P>
The time after World War II was described as the time of the theory of mass
destruction. The  doctrine in the cold war was not to priorizate targets or
precise targeting but to destroy everything  in order to win the war. Strategic
bombing and ballistic missiles were designed for use on a  massive scale and
small battlefield nuclear and chemical devices were added to the weapons 
arsenal.</P>
<P>

</P>
<H2>Information wave</H2>
<P>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, third wave technologies and ideas began
to change the industrial  wave societies. The mass society became slowly a
communication society. With this development  the military doctrine began to
change. The duality between the two waves was expressed in the  Gulf War of
1990-91 where a dual war was fought by the allies. On one hand, mass destruction
 was used like in World War II with large bomb carpets over the enemy troops but
on the other  hand, high tech weapons were used to aim the targets precisely.
The fear that the allies high-tech  military would fail in the desert
environment of Kuwait and Iraq was widely spread at the  beginning of the war.
This fear, combined with the battle-tested army of Saddam Hussein, feeded  the
concern about potenial huge allied losses. This could have become true if the
Gulf had been  fought in the typical second wave way. However, the Air-Land
Battle doctrine already had been  known in the military world but Saddam Hussein
seems to have been unaware of it. The allies  were preparing the battlefield in
the second wave way using carpet bombing and stupid bomb  drops. At this time,
no high tech weapons were used or needed but bombs dating from 1968, out  of the
Vietnam War were used to hold down and demoralize the enemy. During the same
time, Nighthawk stealth fighters (F-117 A) attacked their targets in Baghdad.
They flew attacks on air- defense centers and military control facilities to
blind the enemy. The allies were deepening the  battle in three dimensions.
Distance, altitude and time were used in the AriLand Battle doctrine.  The front
was in the rear and at the sides and not where the enemy had planned. An
important  point was to destroy the command facilities and the communications to
prevent the information  flow up and down the command chain. Therefore, Iraq was
the first fought AirLand Battle and a  first step towards the Information War by
using smart weapons and computers (there were more  than 3000 computers in the
war zone actually linked to computers in the US <A HREF="#Alger">[11]</A>). </P>
<P>
 Also if Toffler as first described the history of warfare using a model of
three waves, I do not  agree with him that the Gulf war belongs into the
Information wave. At the beginning of his  section describing the third wave, he
mentions that Desert Storm was fought in a dual way, but he  never describes the
Information War in its proper meaning. Information Warfare in the proper use 
was probably not used in the Gulf war. Information Warfare, as tabulated in the
next chapter,  would be fought, if the destruction capability would no longer be
mass destruction weapons but  critical data deletion. The Information War would
be present, if the technology would no longer  be used to make traditional
weapons smarter but to replace them.</P>

<H2>Third wave technology in second wave  weapon systems </H2>
<P>The so called Information Warfare is omnipresent in today's newspapers.
Several times a week,  you can follow a report concerning new, miniaturized
weapon systems. By 2010, the Army hopes  to digitize the battlefield <A HREF="#Alger">[12]</A> and
link every soldier and weapons system with wireless links. The  report about the
21st century land warrior, out of the Marine Officer training camp at Fort 
Quadico, showed the new battle gear for the so called cyberwar. A lightweight
helmet with  mounted display, night vision sensors and flat video panel (all
voice activated), Integrated  Headgear, Body Armor with room for a computer in
the lumbar area who gives friend or foe  identification capability to the
soldier, detects mines and chemicals and has a built in GPS. The  weapon is
equipped with a thermal sight that is able to send still-frames back to the high
command  and is connected (wireless) to the helmet monitor what allows the
soldier to aim at a target  without to expose his body to the enemy. Also if
this sounds quite like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the technique  is available and
this equipment will soon be present on the battlefield and will help to reduce
our  casualties. Nevertheless, this is not a part of the Information Warfare. IW
is &quot;war&quot; without using a  tank at all, not only by using the
technology to make the tank smarter <A HREF="#Alger">[2]</A>. But also if Information  Warfare will
replace a smaller or larger part of today's weapon system, there is no way that
this  technology can replace the soldier until the &quot;war&quot; changed so
that nobody is involved  physically.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>C3I</H2>
<P>At the head of the information army, there is the so called C3I - Command,
Control,  Communications and Intelligence. Often today its called C4I with
adding Computers into the term.  At this level, the decisions are made and the
money flow is controlled. C3I is a small group with  specialists dedicated for
each area of interest. As an example, I describe here the C3I group of the
United States OSD (Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense).</P>

<H2>Soft War</H2>
<P>This kind of warfare matches the definition of Information Warfare only in a
global way. The aim  is not directly to archive information superiority, but to
manipulate the enemy (or the own  population) with false or adapted information.
The TV is used to shape the other Nations will,  changing his view of reality.
There could be sent for example a &quot;morphed&quot; TV program that shows  the
enemy troop leader or foreign politicians who are making unpopular announcements
with the  goal to alienate them from there troops/people. This kind of warfare
is mostly used in combination  with &quot;jamming&quot; which is described in
the next chapter.</P>
<P>
Another way to &quot;fight&quot; the soft war, is to use it also in the own
country. An incident in the gulf  war could be mentioned here. In a world wide
broadcasted news block, CNN showed a women  who described how the Iraq soldiers
are carrying live important equipment for new born babies  out of the Kuwait
hospitals. Later, it was discovered, that this women was related to the Kuwait 
Embassy in Washington DC. Therefore, the interview was set up <A HREF="#Alger">[2]</A>. A controlled
media can and  will be used to broadcast public relation for a goal.</P>

modifying that  program. A virus executes only when its host program begins to
run. The virus then  replicates itself, infecting other programs as it
reproduces.&quot; <A HREF="#Alger">[7]</A></P>
<P>
 Viruses are well known in every computer based environment, so that it is not
astonishing that this  type of rough program is used in the Information Warfare.
We could imagine that the CIA (or  Army, Air Force ....) inserts computer
viruses into the switching networks of the enemy's phone  system. As today's
telephone systems are switched by computers, you can shut them down, or at 
least causing massive failure, with a virus as easy that you can shut down a &quot;normal&quot;
computer. An  example what the damage a virus could cause exists. We can compare
it with the system crash of  AT&amp;T long distance switching system on January
15, 1990 <A HREF="#Alger">[10]</A>. </P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Worms</H2>
<P>&quot;A worm is an independent program. It reproduces by copying itself in
full-blown fashion  from one computer to another, usually over a network. Unlike
a virus, it usually doesn't  modify other programs.&quot;<A HREF="#Alger">[7]</A></P>
<P>
 Also if worms don't destroy data (like the Internet Worm, described in <A HREF="#Alger">[5]</A>),
they can cause the loss  of communication with only eating up resources and
spreading through the networks. A worm can  also easily be modified so that data
deletion or worse occurs. With a &quot;wildlife&quot; like this, I could 
imagine breaking down a networked environment like a ATM and banking network.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Trojan horses</H2>
<P>&quot;A Trojan horse is a code fragment that hides inside a program and
performs a disguised  function. It's a popular mechanism for disguising a virus
or a worm&quot;<A HREF="#Alger">[7]</A></P>
<P>
 A trojan horse could be camouflaged as a security related tool for example like
SATAN (Security  Administrating Tool for Analyzing Networks). SATAN checks UNIX
system for security holes  and is freely available on the Internet. If someone
edits this program so that it sends discovered  security holes in an e-mail
message back to him (lets also include the password file? No problem),  the
Cracker learns much information about vulnerable hosts and servers. A clever
written trojan  horse does not leave traces of its presence and because it does
not cause detectable damage, it is  hard to detect.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Logic bombs</H2>
<P>&quot;A bomb is a type of Trojan horse, used to release a virus, a worm or
some other system  attack. It's either an independent program or a piece of code
that's been planted by a  system developer or programmer.&quot;<A HREF="#Alger">[7]</A></P>
<P>
 With the overwhelming existence of US based software (e.g. MS Windows or UNIX
systems), the  US Government, or whomever you would like to imagine, could
decide that no software would be  allowed to be exported from that country
without a Trojan horse. This hidden function could  become active when a
document with &quot;war against the USA&quot; exists on the computer. Its
activation  could also be triggered from the outside. An effect could be to
format the computers harddisks or  to mail the document to the CIA.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Trap doors</H2>
<P>&quot;A trap door, or a back door, is a mechanism that's built into a system
by its designer. The  function of a trap door is to give the designer a way to
sneak back into the system,  circumventing normal system protection.&quot;<A HREF="#Alger">[7]</A></P>
<P>
 As I mentioned in the last section, all US software could be equipped with a
trap door that would  allow IW agencies to explore systems and the stored data
on foreign countries. This could be most  useful in cases of military strategic
simulations and plans and would provide the DoD's intelligence  with vital
information.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Chipping</H2>
<P>Just as software can contain unexpected functions, it is also possible to
implement similar  functions in hardware. Today's chips contain millions of
integrated circuits that can easily be  configured by the manufacturer so that
they also contain some unexpected functions. They could  be built so that they
fail after a certain time, blow up after they receive a signal on a specific 
frequency, or send radio signals that allow identification of their exact
location - the number of  possible scenarios exceeds, by far, the scope of this
paper. The main problem with chipping is that  the specific (adapted) chip be
installed in the place that is useful for the Information Warrior. The  easiest
solution is to built the additional features into all the chips manufactured in
the country that  is interested in this type of IW.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Nano machines and Microbes</H2>
<P>Nano machines and Microbes provide the possibility to cause serious harm to
a system. Unlike  viruses, we can use these to attack not the software but the
hardware of a computer system. Nano  machines are tiny robots (smaller than
ants) that could be spread at an information center of the  enemy. They crawl
through the halls and offices until they find a computer. They are so small that
 they enter the computer through slots and shut down electronic circuits. </P>
<P>
 Another way to damage the hardware is a special breed of microbes. We know that
they can eat  oil, what about if they were bred for eating silizium? They would
destroy all integrated circuits in a  computer lab, a site, a building, a
town.......</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>Electronic jamming</H2>
<P>In the old days (and even today) electronic jamming was used to block
communications channels  at the enemy's equipment so that they can't receive any
information. The next step is not to block  their traffic, but instead overwhelm
them with incorrect information. This type of disinformation  can also be
combined with the possibilities described in the section &quot;soft war&quot;</P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>HERF Guns - EMP Bombs</H2>
<P>HERF stands for High Energy Radio Frequency. HERF guns are able to shoot a
high power radio  signal at an electronic target and put it out of function. The
damage can be moderate (e.g. that a  system shuts down, but can be restarted) or
severe (e.g. the system hardware has been physically  damaged). Electronic
circuits are more vulnerable to overload that most people would suspect.  This
mechanism uses HERF guns with big success. In essence, HERF guns are nothing but
radio  transmitters. They send a concentrated radio signal to the target. The
target can be a mainframe  inside a business building, an entire network in a
building, or as today's planes and cars are stuffed  with electronic equipment,
the target can even be a moving vehicle with all the inherent dangers  for the
people who are inside. </P>
<P>
EMP stands for electromagnetic pulse. The source can be a nuclear or a
non-nuclear detonation. It  can be used by special forces teams who infiltrate
the enemy's and detonate a device near their  electronic devices. It destroys
the electronics of all computer and communication systems in a  quite large
area. The EMP bomb can be smaller than a HERF gun to cause a similar amount of 
damage and is typically used to damage not a single target (not aiming in one
direction) but to  damage all equipment near the bomb.</P>

<H1><A NAME="IW-in-use">Information Warfare in use</A></H1>
<H2>Who uses (or could use) Information  Warfare</H2>
<P>Who uses Information Warfare against who today and the military use of IW is
not officially  known, at least only from public sources. There has been a wide
discussion on whether IW tools  were used in the Persian Gulf War and whether
the CIA had overtaken a wireless network of the  Iraqi Army, but these messages
were fake or could not be proven. Desert Storm was mostly a war  where &quot;smart&quot;
weapons were used to destroy the enemy's headquarters.</P>
<P>
 Soft War was widely used to demoralize the enemy troops in Desert Storm.  Ten
of thousands of  pamphlets were dropped over enemy forces, part of them in
thousands of plastic cans to draw the  attention of the Iraqis toward the sea.</P>
<P>
 Information Warfare, in its wider sense, is daily used between individuals and
corporations.  Computer system penetrations are reported daily to emergency
report teams that are in charge to  take countermeasures. Often, the attackers
(crackers) are arguing that they do not commit a crime  but improving the
security of the system by pointing to its weaknesses. However, data disclosure 
and denial of service are a serious problem.</P>
<P>

</P>
<H2>Who is vulnerable?</H2>
<P>The contradiction about Information Warfare is, that it is forced by nations
that are highly</P>
<P>
technologized. Information War on the battlefield will therefore be used mostly
by them.   Unfortunately, today, most potential enemies do not have the
technological capability. IW can  successfully be used against them. The enemy
has to have high tech weapons and communication  to use IW in a practical
manner. Therefore, countries which develop these new kind of weapons  and tactic
are also the most vulnerable. Third wave weapons cannot be used against first
wave  armies and partisans activities. And they only have a partial effect
against second wave armies.   Information Warfare can also be used in a &quot;non
military&quot; way against individuals and whole  societies. This new style of
warfare gives potential enemies the power to disrupt the  communication
capabilities of a country and thereby break down its business.</P>
<P>
 The Information Warfare weapons could more likely be used in the near future as
terrorist  weapons rather than on the battlefield by the regular armies. Today's
communication society is  extremely vulnerable to disruptions. Instead of
planting a bomb in a airplane with all the dangers  for the terrorists, they
could shut down all the communication capabilities from the tower of a  airport
to the hundreds of airplanes that the control center guides. A accident
following this  disruption would be most likely.</P>
<P>

</P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Conclusions">Conclusions</A></H1>
<P>The US and other high tech states are moving from second to third wave forms
of society and to  third wave war. Today, third wave weapons are used in a
second wave armies and societies. In the  news, the use of high-tech weapons is
often mistaken as Information Warfare.</P>
<P>
 The US and other high tech societies are especially vulnerable to Information
Warfare attacks.  They rely heavily on today's electronic communication and data
exchange. An offender can attack  these information backbones with (in
comparison to the damage) low investment of finance and  equipment. </P>
<UL><P>
 Our systems are mainly vulnerable for the following reasons:</P>
<P>
  High tech equipment is available all over the world (for friend and enemy).</P>
<P>
  The awareness of the danger of Information Warfare is mostly not appropriate
at the  executive level.</P>
<P>
  A lot of computer systems are poorly managed and poorly equipped to prevent
against  intruders</P>
<P>
  Attackers use sophisticated tools to break into systems or get desired
information</P>
<P>
  Attacks over the Internet can originate from places that are physically
located on the  other side of the globe.</P>
<P>
  It is impossible to make a system absolutely secure</P></UL>
<P>
 Corporate Information Warfare is used every day in our society. Only a small
part of all incidents  are known. Many incidents are never discovered and most
others are not known outside of the  organization for fear of negative
reactions.</P>
