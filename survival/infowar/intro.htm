<h3>WHAT IS INFORMATION WARFARE?<h3/>
<p>
As defined by Winn Schwartau, Information Warfare:
Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway (1994):
<p>
<i>"Information Warfare is an electronic conflict in which
information is a strategic asset worthy of conquest or
destruction.  Computers and other communications and
information systems become attractive first-strike
targets."
</i><p>


<h3>WHAT IS INFORMATION WARFARE?</h3>

<img src="45a096.gif" align=middle></a>

The author's definition:
<p>
<i>"Information Warfare is a war in which the weapons of
warfare are not guns and bombs and bullets that visibly
destroy flesh, blood and bone, but electronic and
electromagnetic weapons that could:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cause an airplane to crash without even the
     slightest evidence of foulplay, 
<p>
<li>Destroy an entire financial system by diverting
     its electronic funds to another country, 
<p>
<li>Manipulate and monitor the electronic transactions
     of a major corporation interfering with its day to
     day activities, or 
<p>
<li>Even destroy a country.
</ul>
</i>
<p>While these claims sound too far fetched to even
comprehend, they are a real possibility because of the
importance of the Global Information Superhighway (GIS)
and the vast amount of computers communicating with
each other via the GIS.
<p>


<h3>THE INFORMATION AGE HAS ARRIVED</h3>
<p>


<img src="32a023.gif" align=middle></a>


The United States (US) has approximately 125 million
computers communicating through complex land- and
satellite-based communications systems and is leading
the world into a globally networked society.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The US economy is dependent upon these computer systems
     working consistently
<p>
<li>Information has taken on great economic value; the
     terms "information" and "economy" have almost
     become synonymous within the US
<p>
<li>The US Military has moved from "electronic
     warfare" into the "information warfare" arena by
     developing intelligent weapons systems that can
     even make decisions while in combat situations
<p>
<li>The US has also developed passive weapons that can
     monitor or interfere with a communications system
     yet never be detected
</ul>

<p>
The business and financial sectors of the US rely
heavily upon computers and telecommunications devices:
<ul>
<p><li>Personnel files, financial information, proposal
     information, salaries, and more, all reside on a
     company's computer or networked computer system
     along with strategic business planning activities
<p>
<li>"Cybercash" or <a
href="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/kimc/iwfiles/mmoney.html"> "megabyte
money"</a>
     travels around the GIS at speeds of light in the banking sector; even
     now individuals can manage their bank accounts via
     any touch tone telephone
<p>
<li>Even the US Government relies heavily upon its
     computer systems; the CIA, FBI, DoD, Pentagon,
     DoJ, White House are all heavily dependent upon
     their own systems and their ability to communicate
     with each other
<p>
<li>The average US citizen has become accustomed to
     the easy access of both government and public
     information with vehicles such as the Internet and
          the public telephone system
</ul>
<p>


<h3>WE HAVE BECOME VULNERABLE TARGETS</H3>


<img src="27a012.gif" align=middle></a>

<p>
With US and world economies so dependent upon
acquiring, manipulating, transferring, and managing
vast amounts of information and information systems, we
have all become easy targets for today's Information
Warriors (IWs).  
<p>
We have become "digitally addicted" to our computers
and networks thereby increasing our vulnerability even
more to individuals who desire and plan to hurt us as
individuals, businesses, governments, and nations.
<p>
The unique history of US economics has plummeted our
country into greater risk of being sabotaged
economically.  After all, the likelihood of another
country physically attacking the US is almost zero (0). 
However, the US economy has become an asset of national
security; and, anyone wanting to destroy the US must
first destroy its economic system.
<p>
To explain this further, it is necessary to understand
how the US economic system has developed throughout the
last fifty years.

<H3>WITH ONE STROKE OF THE PEN</h3>


<img src="32c001.gif" align=middle></a>


<p>
After World War II (WWII) on July 22, 1944, the US
signed the Bretton Woods Agreement.  For a 30-year
period (1944-1974), the world's major currencies were
locked onto the American dollar which, in turn, was
locked onto the price of gold residing in banks and
other locations in the country.  Although some scholars
may disagree with the economic merits of a system like
this, it did maintain some form of stability within the
US and the entire world because the price of a physical
commodity, gold, determined the value of the US dollar.
<p>
However, on August 15, 1971, President Richard M. Nixon
signed a bill that in one swift, almost unnoticed
stroke of the pen entirely obliterated the dollar-
backed economic structure of the US by permitting the
dollar to fluctuate along with the rest of the world's
currencies.
<p>


<h3>
COMPUTERS DO THE TRADING AND TRACKING</h3>


<img src="32c004.gif" align=middle></a>


<p>
Additionally, as the Global computer networks grew by
leaps and bounds, each country's fluctuating currency
is monitored and tracked by the buying and selling of
stock options and futures traded on a 24-hour period
all around the world.  The world's "wall streets" now
rely on computers and telecommunications networks to
transact millions of dollars worth of business per
second.
<p>
Literally, the price of the American dollar and the
currencies of the world reside within this realm we
refer to as Cyberspace-in the midst of computer systems
and network cables too vast to even picture in one's
mind.  Consequently, with such vast sums of money-real
only within the realm of Cyberspace-the wealth and
survival of nations could depend solely upon:
<p><ul>
<li>The trustworthiness of those individuals in
     control of the computer and transmission systems
     housing this important data, and
<p>
<li>The continual dependability of those computers and
     transmission systems that transact the
          information.

<h3>
INFORMATION WARRIOR (IW) ATTACK STRATEGIES
</h3>


<img src="25a001.gif" align=middle></a>


<p>
As discussed earlier, the IW's strategies of attack
upon the information and computer systems of the US and
the world are:
<p><ul>
<li>Theft of information
<p>
<li>Modification of information
<p>
<li>Destruction of information
<p>
<li>Destruction of the information infrastructure
</ul>
<p>
One does not have to be an Albert Einstein to realize
the damage that could be done to the US economy if any
one or more of the above events occurred at an
international level.  But, perhaps there is one more
strategy that has not been discussed yet and not listed
above-ignorance.  It is our ignorance of the weapons
used by IWs to accomplish their means, and it is
ignorance, coupled with denial that this warfare is
serious business, that will be our greatest
vulnerability.

<h3>
THE WEAPONS OF INFORMATION WARFARE:
Computer Viruses
</h3>


<img src="11a004.gif" align=middle></a>



<p>
Most of us are familiar with computer viruses and what
that can do to a computer or network system.  One can
even purchase a book on how to create a computer virus
("The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses" by Mark
Ludwig) and similar instructions reside for free on the
Internet. 
<p>
Just as a physical virus makes an individual ill
creating a wide variety of symptoms within the human
body, a computer virus can accomplish the same goals
within a computer or computer system.  
<p>
Computer viruses may:
<p><ul>
<li>Cause a computer to totally die (or shut down),
<p>
<li>Cause a computer to lose information,
<p>
<li>Cause a computer to mismanage information or
     instructions, or
<p>
<li>Cause a computer to malfunction.
</ul>
<p>



<h3>
THE WEAPONS OF INFORMATION WARFARE:
Sniffers
</h3>



<img src="28k044.gif" align=middle></a>


<p>
There are two ways of "sniffing" out information on a
communications system:
<p><ol>
<li>By using a Network Analyzer, a piece of test
     equipment (hardware) developed to analyze and
     diagnose problems within a network.  It can also
     divulge secret passwords and access codes to the
     IW.
<p>
<li>By purchasing Commercially available Software
     programs that accomplish the same objective. 
     These sniffer programs an be used on desktop PCs
     or laptop computers.
<p>
     IPX Permissive is available to IWs and reads and
     deciphers Novell network packets.
</ol>
<p>



<h3>
THE WEAPONS OF INFORMATION WARFARE:
Passive Sniffers
</h3>


<img src="11a169.gif" align=middle></a>



<p>
By using a magnetic inductor (or also called a current
probe or transducer) instead of a hardwire connection,
this passive sniffing device accomplishes two goals:
<p><ol>
<li>There is no disruption of network activities, and
<p>
<li>There is no simple way to detect the sniffer
     because the device is not electrically connected
     to the network.
</ol>
<p>Since these devices can be mounted upon public switched
telephone equipment (given the right circumstances),
the IW now has a vast amount of knowledge and
information at his fingertips which he may use as he
pleases.

<h3>
THE WEAPONS OF INFORMATION WARFARE:
Van Eck Detection
</h3>



<img src="11a138.gif" align=middle></a>


<p>
A computer broadcasts information into the
electromagnetic spectrum that encompasses the physical
air and surroundings where it is physically located. 
Miniature receivers placed near the computer can
electromagnetically eavesdrop on television and radio
signals, and voice or data communications.
<p>
Electromagnetic Eavesdropping is sometimes called Van
Eck detection or radiation named after the Dutch
scientist, Professor Wim van Eck, who in 1985 published
an unclassified paper stating:
<p><i>
     "...it seems justified to estimate the maximum
     reception distance using only a normal TV receiver
     at around 1km..."  
<p></i>
<p>Even <a
href="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/kimc/iwfiles/tempest.html">Tempested</a>
computers were not safe from this form of electromagnetic eavesdropping.
<p>




<h3>
THE WEAPONS OF INFORMATION WARFARE:
Cryptography
</h3>


<img src="12e018.gif" align=middle></a>


<p>
According to the US Department of Defense (DoD),
cryptography and nuclear technology are two of the most
sensitive areas of scientific research because they
both represent military strength. 
<p>
If the IW can crack the cryptographic codes used by the
Government in its daily communications business or in
the banking industry for electronic transfer of funds,
he can access information and money without anyone
being the wiser.  He could sell the information or
transfer monetary funds into his own bank account
within another country.  
<p>
The US Government has adopted the Data Encryption
Standard (DES) as the national standard for data
protection.  The National Security Agency (NSA) had DES
classified as a "weapons system" thereby making it
illegal to export DES outside the US without the
approval of NSA, the Department of State and the
Department of Commerce.
<p>

On the surface, it appears the US has taken strong
measures to keep DES out of the hands of the wrong
individuals.  But, Winn Schwartau tells how DES has
been exploited (1984):
<p>
"Since DES was a national standard, it was entered into
the public domain and the DES algorithms were openly
published for anyone to see.  For the price of a stamp,
any American or even a foreign national could, and can,
write to NIST (National Institute of Standards and
Technology) and receive a copy of the DES standard. 
Despite the fact that DES was controlled as a weapon,
we published--and gave away free--the instruction
manual and parts lists, enabling anyone and any country
to build their own.  That's like sending a Patriot
Missile kit to Libya or Iran with a note saying,
"Please don't build this."
<p>
We have just handed the IWs of the world a free course
in cracking anyone's communications if they use DES. 
The IW would say, "Who says the best things in life
aren't free?"

<h3>
THE WEAPONS OF INFORMATION WARFARE:
Chipping
</h3>


<img src="22a078.gif" align=middle></a>


<p>
The most important part of a computer is its Central
Processing Unit (CPU), and the most important part of
the CPU is the microprocessor. 
<p><ul>
<li>Sometimes during the manufacturing process, a
     microprocessor, or usually called "chip," gets
     damaged in processing.
<p>
     This can happen innocently because of human error.
<p>
<li>However, this can also be done deliberately by
     actually rewiring or rearranging the tiny
     electronic circuits etched upon the small chip. 
     When this is done deliberately, it is called
     chipping.
<p>
<li>Sometimes the damage to the computer may not
     surface until much later in time.  The chip can be
     reworked in such a way as to create a "time bomb"
     effect.  When the computer performs a particular
     function on a particular cycle, the bomb goes off
          and it looks extremely innocent.

<h3>
THE WEAPONS OF INFORMATION WARFARE:
HERF Guns and EMP/T Bombs
</h3>


<img src="31b038.gif" align=middle></a>


<p>
HERF (High Energy Radio Frequency) Guns are magnetic
guns that target the electronic circuits within a
computer system rather than a human being.  With enough
energy, an electronic weapon like this could literally
"fry" a computer's hardware parts actually sending them
up in smoke.
<p>
The ElectroMagnetic Pulse Transformer, or EMP/T Bomb,
is identical to the HERF Gun except that it's a
thousand times more powerful.
<p>
These types of weapons are nonlethal to human beings,
yet they can destroy the human's ability to conduct and
execute military activities rendering him helpless. 
They can be used to destroy aircraft by targeting the
electronics.  When the airplane crashes, not a trace of
foulplay can be found.
<p>





<h3>
CONCLUSION
</h3>


<p>
The preceding information only touches upon the surface of what has become information
warfare in Cyberspace.  As long as human beings live and work on planet Earth, there will
always be those individuals who:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Believe that are above the law, whether they are an officer of the law or an ordinary
citizen, or
<p>
<li>Unintentionally wage information warfare on those who are unsuspecting.
<p> </ul>

We cannot stop the moving freight train transporting new technologies to our door; but, we can
arm outselves with "knowledge" and "determination."
<p>
<ul>
<li>The knowledge of new emerging technologies and how they, as only instruments in our
hands, can be used as a force for good or a vehicle for evil, and
<p>
<li>The determination to never allow our technologies to rule us--to be so enamoured with our
powerful toys that we never forget how human we really are.
