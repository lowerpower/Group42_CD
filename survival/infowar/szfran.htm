<font size=+2>T</font>he profession of arms in a democracy is not exempt from oversight
or from consideration of just conduct, even in warfare.  Where
the will of the people, the moral high ground, and the technological
high ground are the same, the profession will remain a useful
and lofty one.  If, however, the moral high ground is lost, a
domino effect occurs: public support is lost, the technological
high ground is lost, and the armed forces are lost.  It is within
this framework that this article postulates a theory of information
warfare<a href="#1">1</a> within the larger context of warfare and proposes ways
to wage information warfare at the strategic and operational levels.
 The tools to wage information warfare are at hand, and because
information weapons are such powerful weapons, both combatants
and noncombatants need to be protected against them.  The vulnerability
to information warfare is universal.  The decisions to pursue
the development of information weapons or to prosecute information
warfare are governmental decisions.  These decisions need to be
made consciously and deliberately and with an understanding of
the moral and ethical risks of information warfare.  After assessing
all the risks and deciding to create information weapons or engage
in information warfare, the decision makers should first have
an understanding of these weapons and a weapon employment theory
before such warfare starts rather than after the weapons are deployed
or have already been employed.
<P>
<h2>Information</h2>
<P>
<I>Information</I> as used here means the &quot;content or meaning
of a message.&quot;<a href="#2">2</a>  An aim of warfare always has been to affect
the enemy's information systems.  In the broadest sense, information
systems encompass every means by which an adversary arrives at
knowledge or beliefs.  A narrower view maintains that information
systems are the means by which an adversary exercises control
over, and direction of, fielded forces.  Taken together, information
systems are a comprehensive set of the knowledge, beliefs, and
the decisionmaking processes and systems of the adversary.  The
outcome sought by information attacks at every level is for the
enemy to receive sufficient messages that convince him to stop
fighting.
<P>
Why would an adversary stop fighting?  There are a number of possibilities:
an inability to control fielded forces, demoralization, the knowledge
or belief that combat power has been annihilated, or an awareness
that the prospects of not fighting are superior to the prospects
of continuing the fight.  These &quot;stopfighting&quot; messages
might be as varied in content or meaning as &quot;Cannae has ruined
you,&quot; or &quot;Submit to the Tartar or die,&quot; or &quot;Your
counterattack has failed,&quot; or even &quot;Your own people
do not support you in warfare that kills babies.&quot;  Although
the methods of communicating the stopfighting message have changed
over the years, the meaning of the message itself remains fairly
constant: stop fighting.
<P>
As social institutions evolved from firstwave agrarian societies
to secondwave industrial states, information systems evolved and
decisionmaking processes became more complex.  Mercantile organizations
arose within or alongside the dominant political structures, adding
elements of greater complexity as the scope of their activities
enlarged.  Knowledge networks of knowledge workers, the newest
form of institutional structure, emerged and their numbers increased
in tandem with the availability of the tools of information technology.
 As information technology advanced, information systems allowed
knowledge, or knowhow, to make all the other institutional forms
more effective.<a href="#3">3</a>
<P>
As societal institutions evolved, the ways in which societies
fought evolved also.  The terrorizing drums, banners, and gongs
of Sun Tzu's warfare, aided by information technology, became
the sophisticated psychological operations of modern warfare.
 The aim of warfare moved from, or could move from, exhaustion
to annihilation to control, according to John Arquilla and David
Ronfeldt.<a href="#4">4</a>  Information technology may now have evolved to the
point where &quot;control&quot; can be imposed with little physical
violence or bloodshed.  On the surface this appears to be a good
thing.  At its center, it may be a dangerous thing.  Closer scrutiny
should reveal which of these is the case.
<P>
<h2>What Warfare Is</h2>
<P>
<I>Warfare</I> is the set of all lethal and nonlethal activities
undertaken to subdue the hostile will of an adversary or enemy.
 In this sense, warfare is not synonymous with &quot;war.&quot;<a href="#5">5</a>
 Warfare does not require a declaration of war, nor does it require
existence of a condition widely recognized as &quot;a state of
war.&quot;  Warfare can be undertaken by or against statecontrolled,
statesponsored, or nonstate groups.  Warfare is hostile activity
directed against an adversary or enemy.  The aim of warfare is
not necessarily to kill the enemy.  The aim of warfare is to merely
subdue the enemy.  In fact, the &quot;acme of skill&quot; is to
subdue an adversary without killing him.<a href="#6">6 </a> The adversary is subdued
when he behaves in ways that are coincident with the ways in which
we--the aggressor or the defender--intend for him to behave.<a href="#7">7</a>
 In aiming to subdue hostile will, we must have a clear understanding
of the specific nonhostile behaviors we intend to compel, or the
hostile ones we want to prevent.
<P>
When the security forces of a state engage an enemy state in warfare,
the government determines the specific nonhostile behaviors sought
from the adversary.  When other groups--guerrillas, gangs,
clans--engage in warfare, the group leader decides the specific
nonhostile behaviors sought.  In both state and nonstate warfare
forms, the decisions made by group leaders define the aims, the
methods, and the desired postconflict conditions of the warfare.
 Even so, it is a fiction, albeit a common and convenient one,
to assert that &quot;states&quot; or &quot;groups&quot; wage warfare.
 The decision to engage in warfare, including the decision to
terminate warfare, is made by <I>leaders</I> in the state or group.
 Likewise, it is the hostile will of enemy leaders that must be
subdued to be successful in warfare.<a href="#8">8</a>  Group members, or the citizens
of states, may influence the leaders' decisions, but it is the
hostile will of leadership that must be subdued.  If the &quot;mandate
of heaven&quot; passes from the leader to other group members--successor
leaders or the population at large--the hostile will of these
new leaders must be subdued.  Information warfare can help withdraw
the mandate of heaven from the hands of adversary leaders.
<P>
The great discovery that launched the information age was awareness
that everything in the external world could be reduced to combinations
of zeroes and ones.  These combinations could be transmitted electronically
as data and recombined upon receipt to form the basis of information.
 According to the seminal work on control warfare by Arquilla
and Ronfeldt, information is more than the content or meaning
of a message.  Rather, information is &quot;any difference that
makes a difference.&quot;<a href="#9">9</a>  Information warfare is a form of conflict
that attacks information systems directly as a means to attack
adversary knowledge or beliefs.  Information warfare can be prosecuted
as a component of a larger and more comprehensive set of hostile
activities--a netwar or cyberwar--or it can be undertaken
as the sole form of hostile activity.<a href="#10">10</a>  Most <I>weapons</I>--a
word used to describe the lethal and nonlethal tools of warfare--only
have high utility --against external adversaries.  While most
often  employed against external adversaries, many of the weapons
of information warfare are equally well suited for employment
against internal constituencies.  For example, a state or group
would not normally use guns and bombs against its own members;
however, the weapons of information warfare can be used, have
been used, and very likely will be used against both external
and internal adversaries.  Information warfare in the Third Reich,
for example, was omnifrontal.
<P>
Information warfare is hostile activity directed against any part
of the knowledge and belief systems of an adversary.  The &quot;adversary&quot;
is anyone uncooperative with the aims of the leader.  Externally,
this is the agreedupon &quot;enemy,&quot; or the &quot;not us.&quot;
 Internally, the adversary might be the traitor, the faint of
heart, or the fellow traveler--anyone who opposes or is insufficiently
cooperative with the leader who controls the means of information
warfare.  If the internal members of a group are insufficiently
supportive of the aims of the leader during warfare, internal
information warfare (including such things as propaganda, deception,
character assassination, rumors, and lies) can be used in attempts
to make them more supportive of the aims of leadership.
<P>
<h2>Warfare and Its Relation to What We Know or Believe</h2>
<P>
Whether directly employed against an external adversary or internal
constituencies,  information warfare has the ultimate aim of using
information weapons to affect (influence, manipulate, attack)
the knowledge and belief systems of some external adversary. 
It is useful in warfare, for example, for an external adversary
to know, or at least believe, that the opposing state or group
is united against him or her.  Information warfare, simultaneously
employed to make internal constituencies cooperative and external
adversaries believe its enemy is a united front, is used to help
seat that awareness in the knowledge and beliefs residing in the
mind of adversary leadership.
<P>
<b><i>The Fragility of Knowledge and Beliefs</i></b>
<P>
Knowledge systems are those systems organized and operated to
sense or observe verifiable phenomenological indicators or designators,
translate these indicators into perceived realities, and use these
perceptions to make decisions and direct actions.<a href="#11">11</a>  Sensing that
the plate is hot, one releases it.  Observing that one's expenditures
exceed income, one curbs spending.  Our sensing and observing
systems allow us to <I>know</I>.  We decide and act based on our
knowledge, but not on knowledge alone.  Knowledge systems are
organized according to scientific principles and sustained by
the scientific method.  That is, knowledge systems are organized
to collect empirical data by sensing or observation to formulate
hypotheses, to conduct tests that validate or invalidate the hypotheses,
and to use these findings as the basis for further action.  Belief
systems are those implicit or explicit orientations both to empirical
data in the form of verifiable perceptions and to other data or
awareness (nightmares, phobias, psychoses, neuroses, and all the
other creatures living in the fertile swamp of the subconscious,
the collective unconscious, or Jung's &quot;unconscious psyche&quot;<a href="#12">12</a>)
that are not verifiable or, at least, are less easily verifiable.<a href="#13">13</a>
 According to John Boyd, the process or act of orientation (what
Boyd calls &quot;the Big O&quot; in the OODA [observation-orientation-decision-action]
loop) also is influenced by genetic heritage and cultural traditions.<a href="#14">14</a>
 Thus, the orientation of American leaders is different than the
orientation of, say, Japanese or Chinese leaders.  The orientation
of capitalists and their leaders is different than the orientation
of socialists and their leaders.
<P>
Unlike knowledge systems, belief systems are highly individualized.
 Why?  They include the stuff of the unconscious and subconscious,
powerful elements of which others and even the bearer may be unaware.
 Even though the target of information warfare is the mind of
enemy leadership, it is glib reductionism to think of the enemy
as being of &quot;one mind.&quot;  The enemy is really many individual
enemies, many minds.  This only complicates the problem slightly.
 For example, if the enemy is dispersed, separate minds can be
attacked separately, using the fact of isolation to the attacker's
advantage.  If the enemy is concentrated (and over half the people
on the planet will live in metropolitan complexes by the year
2020 and will be accessible in large numbers by way of information
technology), the attack can be prosecuted against large groups.
 Even so, the aim of warfare is to subdue the hostile will of
leaders and decision makers.  This can be done directly by attacks
aimed at influencing or manipulating the leader's knowledge or
beliefs or indirectly by attacking the knowledge or beliefs of
those upon whom the leader depends for action.  Leaders and decision
makers usually are not difficult to identify in any organization
hierarchy.  When an organization applies power or force, that
organization most often assumes hierarchical characteristics.
 Thus, the knowledge and beliefs of decision makers are the Achilles'
heel of hierarchies.
<P>
Knowledge systems, because they are more scientific, are less
influenced by culture and by irrational or nonverifiable factors
than are belief systems, yet both knowledge systems and belief
systems are components present in every human decisionmaking system.<a href="#15">15</a>
 What is known, including the methods by which it came to be known,
can be tested by its relation to something else and determined
to be valid or invalid, true or false, real or unreal.  What is
believed is not subject to all the same tests.  Even so, beliefs
are no less compelling than empirically derived knowledge.  Both
knowledge and beliefs affect human decision making.  Since the
aim of warfare is to influence adversary behavior by influencing
adversary decisions, information warfare actions must be directed
against both the adversary's knowledge systems and belief systems.
 If an adversary is organized as a coalition of multiple and cooperative
centers of gravity, many culturally conditioned belief systems
may exist within the coalition.  These may be engaged and defeated
in detail.  The coalition need not be separate states or groups
working as an alliance.  The coalition can be the constituencies
within a state or within groups.  Clausewitz was correct in asserting
the potential liabilities associated with allies and coalitions.<a href="#16">16</a>
 Moreover, leaders and decision makers of the coalition provide
the most fertile targets for direct or indirect attacks.
<P>
<b><i>Targeting Epistemology</i></b>
<P>
The target system of information warfare can include every element
in the epistemology of an adversary.  <I>Epistemology</I> means
the entire &quot;organization, structure, methods, and validity
of knowledge.&quot;<a href="#17">17</a>  In layperson's terms, it means everything
a human organism--an individual or a group--holds to be
true or real, no matter whether that which is held as true or
real was acquired as knowledge or as a belief.  At the strategic
level, the aim of a &quot;perfect&quot; information warfare campaign
is to influence adversary choices, and hence adversary behavior,
without the adversary's awareness that choices and behavior are
being influenced.  Even though this aim is difficult to attain,
it remains the goal of a perfect information warfare campaign
at the strategic level.  A successful, although not necessarily
perfect, information warfare campaign waged at the strategic level
will result in adversary decisions (and hence actions) that consistently
mismatch or fail to support the intentions or aims of the adversary
leader.
<P>
A successful information warfare campaign waged at the operational
level will support strategic objectives by influencing the adversary's
ability to make decisions in a timely or effective manner.  Said
another way, the aim of information warfare activities at the
operational level is to so complicate or confound the adversary's
decision making process that the adversary cannot act or behave
in a coordinated or effective way.  In information warfare, the
goal is to harmonize the activities taken at the operational level
with those taken at the strategic level so that, taken altogether,
the adversary makes decisions that result in actions that consistently
support our aims by consistently failing to support the adversary's
aims.
<P>
At the strategic level, the leaders contemplating an information
warfare campaign need to know the answers to at least three questions.
 First, what is the relationship of the information warfare campaign
to the larger aims of the campaign?  Second, what is it we wish
the adversary leaders to know or believe when the information
warfare campaign is concluded?  That is, what is the desired epistemological
endstate and consequently the success criterion?  Third, what
are the best information warfare tools to employ in order to meet
the established success criteria?  That is, how will &quot;means&quot;
be related to &quot;ends&quot;?
<P>
At the operational level, the leaders responsible for prosecuting
the &quot;grand tactics&quot; also need the answers to some questions.
 Will there be any withheld targets or prohibited weapons in the
information warfare attacks?  Is the epistemological endstate
to be reached all at once, everywhere, or are there interim states
that need to be reached in specific geographical areas, in a specific
sequence, or in specific sectors of information activity?  The
questions of &quot;command and signal&quot; also need to be addressed.
 Specifically, leaders at the operational level need to know when
attacks will be terminated and the means by which the termination
order will be communicated.  These are important questions because
information weapons, depending on the weapons used, may cause
collateral damage to the attacker's knowledge and belief systems.<a href="#18">18</a>
 In the worst case, the adversary's response could include counterattacks
against &quot;friendly&quot; information systems that are somehow
indistinguishable from collateral damage caused by the information
analog of &quot;friendly fire.&quot;  This thought requires some
elaboration.
<P>
Warfare is a human social activity.<a href="#19">19</a>  The workplace of warriors
is society, the societies of those engaged in combat and the societies
of active and passive spectator groups.  Because it is a human
activity--and one dependent on human action, reaction, and
interaction--the outcomes of some warfare activities may be
unpredictable.  As Grant Hammond notes in &quot;Paradoxes of War,&quot;
if the outcomes of a war could be known in advance, there would
be scant reasons for the loser to fight in the first place.<a href="#20">20</a>
 Moreover, there may be lag times between action and response;
some outcomes take longer to develop than others.  Thus, the notion
that World War II was the outcome of World War I (or the peace
treaty that terminated combat) may very well be true.  The unpredictability,
however, is not confined to the consequences of war termination.
 Specific actions in warfare can have specific and unpredictable
reactions.
<P>
Information attacks--attacks aimed at the knowledge or belief
systems of adversaries--can have consequences that are as
unpredictable as attacks aimed at the physical destruction of
property or combat equipment or those aimed at killing human beings.
 Suffice it to say that information attacks have stochastic effects
and that unless these are considered and evaluated in advance,
an information attack may not have the effect ultimately desired.
 Worse, it may have consequences that are so undesirable that
the attacker will rue that an attack was made in the first place.
 The notion of stochastic effects, like the notion of collateral
damage, needs to be considered at both the strategic and operational
levels of information warfare.
<P>
<b><i>The Target Sets of Information Warfare</i></b>
<P>
The more dependent the adversary is on information systems for
decision making, the more vulnerable he is to hostile manipulation
of those systems.  Software viruses only hurt those dependent
on software.  Radioelectronic combat only works against forces
reliant on radios or electronics.  Electromagnetic pulse generators--unless
the generator is a nuclear weapon--do not affect human couriers
and runners.  While this suggests that only postindustrial states
or groups are highly vulnerable to information warfare, the opposite
may be the case for two reasons.  First, preindustrial or agrarian
societies still have vulnerable epistemological systems.  Because
information warfare can be prosecuted against the adversary's
entire epistemology--both knowledge systems and belief systems--even
preindustrial agrarian or primitive societies are vulnerable to
information warfare.  Second, industrial societies, and even some
advanced industrial societies, may acquire much of their telecommunications
infrastructure from more advanced or postindustrial societies
or groups.
<P>
By way of analogy, consider the case of the homeowner and the
architect.  The homeowner may not be aware of flaws in his or
her residence, but the architect is aware.  Likewise, the operator
or &quot;owner&quot; of a telecommunications system designed or
built by others may be unaware of important features of which
only the designer or manufacturer has knowledge.  If the architect
is not directly subordinate or accountable to &quot;the owner,&quot;
then the potential exists for the architect to exploit the hidden
features to his own advantage. In the warfare of business competition,
the architect may have the means, motive, and opportunity to exploit
these features to meet the objectives of the firm, whether or
not the government or the state approves of these actions.
<P>
In the case of advanced societies or groups, attacks against telecommunications
systems can wreak havoc with an adversary's ability to make effective
decisions in warfare.  Yet, one should also appreciate that an
apparition in the sky, even a natural phenomenon like a solar
eclipse, can be used to attack the belief systems of a less advanced
group.  Totems and taboos might function equally as well as the
targets or the tools of information warfare against a primitive
group.  Thus, vulnerability to information warfare is nearly universal,
the differences being only a matter of degree.
<P>
<b><i>An Illustration of Complexity</i></b>
<P>
Information warfare is a complex notion.  It is complex because
the weapons employed are and always have been as common as words,
pictures, and images, even though today these may be communicated
or manipulated in uncommon ways.  It is complex because the attacks
are crafted by minds to affect minds.  In addition, it is complex
because the attacks can be direct or indirect, aimed at internal
or external constituencies, the only constant being the effect
sought.  The desired effect of information warfare is to influence
and change what the adversary believes or what the adversary knows.
<P>
The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857-58 provides an example of the complexity.
 The mutiny reportedly was triggered by a rumor that the British
were coating rifle cartridges in animal fat.<a href="#21">21</a>  Contact with this
fat was taboo to the Hindu and Muslim sepoys (Indian natives in
the British army).  Even though the cartridge coating was <I>not
</I> animal fat and could be subjected to scientific tests that
would result in this <I>knowledge</I>, the sepoy <I>believed</I>
the substance was animal fat.  This belief was more compelling
to the primitive sepoy than knowledge.  Thus, it was belief, not
knowledge, that influenced sepoy behavior and triggered a difficult
struggle between the British and the Indians.  This case is also
illustrative of the fact that even though the use of this misinformation
was directed against the British leadership, the attack was indirect.
 It was the sepoy leaders who started the rumor, and in so doing
attacked the belief systems of both Hindu and Muslim sepoys to
spur them to rebel against their British masters.
<P>
Thus, information warfare can be waged both internally and externally,
by, against, or between societies or groups of varied technomic
capability (a combination of advances in technology and the increase
of economic wealth).<a href="#22">22</a>  When waged against internal constituencies,
its aim is to use those constituencies to meet the larger aim
of warfare:  subduing the hostile will of an external adversary.
 When information warfare is prosecuted externally, the object
is to subdue the hostile will of external adversary leaders.
<P>
<b><i>Vulnerable Sophisticates?</i></b>
<P>
In states or groups with high technomic capability, the target
set for information warfare at the strategic level is wonderfully
rich:  telecommunications and telephony,<a href="#23">23</a> spacebased sensors,
communications relay systems; automated aids to financial, banking,
and commercial transactions; supporting power production and distribution
systems; cultural systems of all kinds; and the whole gamut of
hardware and software that constitutes how the adversary knows
and what the adversary believes.  Strategic information systems
in states with high technomic capability oftentimes are mirrored
by operationallevel ones of equal complexity.  All are vulnerable
to attack.
<P>
Information warfare need not be deferred until hostility becomes
open.  Adversary leadership will be less likely to fight if it
believes one or more of the following:  that violence is bad,
or that they will be without allies, or that they will face harsh
sanctions should fighting erupt, or that their industrial base
will not support prolonged warfare, or that their armed forces
are unready.  Should actual fighting break out, attacks at the
operational level can harmonize with attacks at the strategic
level.
<P>
The target set at the operational level is equally lucrative when
the adversary has high technomic capability and relies on automated
aids to fight.  Hierarchical systems are most vulnerable, but
even networks have control or relay nodes that are susceptible
to attack.  To function effectively, networks have hierarchical
elements or nodes.  Often these elements are invisible--embedded
software protocols, filters, sort instructions, and the like.<a href="#24">24</a>
 That they are more difficult to attack may not make them immune
to attack.
<P>
The higher its technomic capability and the greater the number
of its interactions with other groups (including internal groups)
or states, the greater the state or group's potential vulnerability
to information warfare.  The vulnerability may increase as network
size increases, dependence on the information transacted increases,
or the number or volume of transactions increases.  Consequently,
a state or group &quot;engaged&quot; worldwide may be exposed
or vulnerable worldwide.  (If the objective of engagement is a
strategic campaign aimed at affecting the knowledge or beliefs
of others, then those engaged are, of course, similarly vulnerable.)
 Democracies are no less vulnerable than totalitarian regimes,
although democratic social systems, as groups, may be somewhat
more faulttolerant.  By that is meant that democracies promote
diversity and diversity increases the tolerance for difference.
 This willingness to accept diversity (and even the bizarre),
the routine coexistence of contradictory knowledge and different
beliefs among individuals and groups, and the constant attempts
at manipulation by marketing experts do not reduce the vulnerability
of a democracy, but they do mitigate the impact of information
warfare attacks.  Said another way, many people in democratic
nations may be immune to attacks because their knowledge may be
limited, their belief systems may always be in flux, and much
information registers only as noise.  Thus, images of televised
eroticism may have little effect on many in the United States.
 Yet, the same images that almost are mundane in the United States
could have dramatic effects if televised in China, Iraq, or Iran.<a href="#25">25</a>
<P>
Even though the democracy's social system may be faulttolerant,
its technomic control apparatus may be less so.  Banking, finance,
trade, travel, and air traffic control are now and increasingly
will become more dependent on information technology systems.
 In 1992 the United States invested over $210 billion on information
technology (about half the level of worldwide investment), and
the amount invested is expected to grow about 18 percent each
year for the next several years.<a href="#26">26</a>  As dependence on information
systems grows, warfare waged by nonstate groups--terrorists,
religious extremists, hostile businesses--against information
systems constitutes a real threat.  The bombing of the World Trade
Center, whatever other general or specific objectives it might
have had, apparently was designed to inflict serious damage on
the trading and banking capability of the United States.  The
information warfare component of some future strategic warfare
campaign waged by terrorists certainly will not fail to include
the powerproduction facilities and communications systems serving
the principal target.  Simultaneous attacks against widely dispersed
nodes could have a strategic effect.  That is, they could affect
the knowledge, beliefs, and the will of leaders.
<P>
A cautionary note: because an information warfare campaign at
the <I>strategic</I> level aims to subdue hostile will by affecting
the knowledge and beliefs of the adversary, it cannot discriminate
between combatants and noncombatants.  Because the weapons of
information warfare systematically attack the adversary's knowledge
and belief systems (that which makes us different from other species),
the likely outcomes of information warfare need to be evaluated
consciously before information attacks are prosecuted.  A successful
information warfare campaign interposes a false reality on the
human target.  At the strategic level, these targets include both
combatants and noncombatants.  The interposition of a false reality
ultimately may be as wrongful and inhumane as the wanton destruction
of crops.  To unhinge a noncombatant from reality, especially
when the effects cannot be known or controlled, may be no less
wrongful than to force another into starvation or cannibalism.
 Said another way, the principles of just war and just conduct
in warfare need to be evaluated whenever <I>strategic</I> information
warfare is contemplated.
<P>
Deception and disinformation, radioelectronic combat, propaganda,
and the whole gamut of &quot;psychological warfare&quot; or command
and control warfare attacks against enemy combatants at the <I>operational
</I> level cannot be said to be wrongful.  These aim to subdue
without fighting or to reduce the amount of violence required.
 Becoming unhinged from reality in combat, like death or some
other form of suffering, is a risk of which combatants are aware
and is a possibility that combatants must accept.  Thus, as long
as information warfare and weapons are restricted by norms or
laws to the operational level of warfare, it would appear that
they are no more or any less evil than any other weapon.  The
problem remains a twofold one: determining the morality of an
information warfare campaign waged at the strategic level and
restricting the use of information weapons to the operational
level.
<P>
The decision to pursue information warfare or develop information
weapons is a leadership decision.  It is a strategic decision
in the United States because it is the Congress, representing
the entire citizenry, that links means to ends.  In the United
States, such a program (if done by the state) would be done with
money appropriated by the Congress.  The Congress, or its oversight
committees, will evaluate the morality of information warfare.
 In the wake of this evaluation, the Congress may confine these
weapons and their use to the operational level of warfare.  The
Congress may also establish safeguards to prevent any such weapons
so developed from being used against internal constituencies.
 The legislative branch also may make laws preventing the use
of information weapons against nonUS noncombatants and internal
constituencies.  As outsourcing and contractingout initiatives
increase, the Congress also can be expected to act to prevent
some commercial enterprise from developing such weapons.  (Have
not news stories and &quot;expos&eacute;s&quot; produced by commercial
news enterprises proven to be contrived, aimed at influencing
our knowledge and beliefs?  Have not subliminal messages been
used in the past in attempts to influence our purchasing behavior?
 Have not hackers entered and affected--or infected--databases
already?  We need to consider that there may be only a slim difference
between a hacker and a terrorist in the information age.  This
is especially so if the hacker can attack things like finance,
credit ratings, college transcripts, or other databases upon which
technomic institutions depend.)  The political leaders in the
United States can be expected to consider the morality of information
weapons and information warfare, no matter which group develops
the weapons or engages in the warfare, and to regulate their use
accordingly.  The Congress very likely will conclude that the
employment of information weapons at the operational level is
useful and necessary, but that employment against noncombatants,
or their employment at the strategic level is wrong.
<P>
The United States should expect that its information systems are
vulnerable to attack.  It should further expect that attacks,
when they come, may come in advance of any formal declaration
of hostile intent by an adversary state.  When they come, the
attacks will be prosecuted against both knowledge systems and
belief systems, aimed at influencing leadership choices.  The
knowledge and beliefs of leaders will be attacked both directly
and indirectly.  Noncombatants, those upon whom leaders depend
for support and action, will be targets.  This is what we have
to look forward to in 2020 or sooner.

<P>
<h5> <a name="1">1.</a>  Information warfare sometimes is erroneously referred to
as command and control warfare, or C2W.  The aim of C2W is to
use physical and radioelectronic combat attacks against enemy
information systems to separate enemy forces from enemy leadership.
 In theory, information warfare actually is a much larger set
of activities aimed at the mind and will of the enemy.

<a name="18">18</a>.The effects to which I refer are more complicated than the
inability to prevent your own jamming from interfering with your
own communications systems.  These unconfinable, spillover effects
of stray electrons can be modeled and some compensation can be
made for their effects.  The weapons and effects of information
warfare are not so easily confinable or controllable.  In warfare
it is common to both demonize and ridicule the enemy.  Ridicule
often takes the form of jokes.  If these jokes ridicule an enemy
from a different ethnic group, these jokes become officially sanctioned
racist jokes. If the ethnic group is part of our own citizenry,
such attacks can cause collateral damage.  The collateral damage
to the armed forces may have effects as farreaching as the appearance
of officially condoned racism.  If one accepts that weapons and
attacks have stochastic effects, then some consequences are unpredictable.

<a name="25"> 25</a>.Iran provides a good example.  The Majles investigation into
the Iranian department of &quot;Voice and Vision&quot; illuminates
Iran's sensitivity to the content and meaning of pictorial messages.
 Consider these comments from the investigation<B>:</B>
<P>
 A basic criticism of the pictorial programs of the Voice and
Vision is lack of attention to full veiling of women, lack of
attention to the chador, and spreading of the culture of the &quot;manteau&quot;
and scarves of the immoral kind.
<P>
The grand leader on occasions has given opinions and directives
to the Voice and Vision organization or its director.  Unfortunately,
the instructions and directives of his honor were not implemented.
 For example: . . . .  From 1368 [21 March 198920 March 1990]
to 1370 [21 March 199020 March 1991], he made reminders to the
Voice and Vision on 14 occasions, the most important of which
concern: A) Misinformation.  B) The low level of quality of the
beyondtheborder programs and failure to propagate and spread Islamic
views in them.  C) The broadcast of blasphemous sentences concerning
the Sire of the Pious. . . . E) Showing actual persons in the
role of the infallible imams.
