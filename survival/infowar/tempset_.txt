          1.  Undelivered  speech  of  President  John  F.  Kennedy, Dallas

                    In the novel 1984, George Orwell foretold a future
          where individuals had no expectation  of privacy because the
          state monopolized the technology of  spying.  The government
          watched the actions of its subjects from birth to death.  No
          one could protect himself because  surveillance and counter-
          surveillance technology was controlled by the government.
               This note explores  the legal status of  a surveillance
          technology  ruefully  known  as  TEMPEST[2].    Using  TEMPEST
          technology  the  information in  any  digital device  may be
          intercepted  and  reconstructed  into   useful  intelligence
          without the  operative ever having to come  near his target.
          The technology is  especially useful in the  interception of
          information  stored  in  digital computers  or  displayed on
          computer terminals.
               The use of TEMPEST is not illegal under the laws of the
          United  States[3],  or  England.    Canada has  specific  laws
          criminalizing TEMPEST eavesdropping but the  laws do more to
          hinder surveillance countermeasures than to prevent  TEMPEST
          surveillance.  In  the United  States it is  illegal for  an
          individual  to  take   effective  counter-measures   against
          TEMPEST surveillance.  This  leads to the conundrum that  it
          is legal  for individuals and  the government to  invade the
          privacy of others but illegal for  individuals to take steps
          to protect their privacy.
               The author would  like to suggest that the  solution to
          this   conundrum   is  straightforward.      Information  on

          2.  TEMPEST  is an  acronym for  Transient Electromagnetic  Pulse
          Emanation Standard.   This standard sets forth the official views
          of the United  States on the amount  of electromagnetic radiation
          that a device may emit without compromising the information it is
          processing.   TEMPEST  is  a defensive  standard; a  device which
          conforms to this standard is referred to as TEMPEST Certified.
               The United States  government has refused to  declassify the
          acronym  for  devices  used   to  intercept  the  electromagnetic
          information of  non-TEMPEST Certified  devices.   For this  note,
          these  devices  and  the  technology  behind  them  will  also be
          referred  to as  TEMPEST;  in  which  case,  TEMPEST  stands  for
          Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Surveillance Technology.
               The  United  States  government refuses  to  release details
          regarding TEMPEST and continues an organized effort to censor the
          dissemination of  information  about it.    For example  the  NSA
          succeeded in shutting  down a  Wang Laboratories presentation  on
          TEMPEST Certified equipment  by classifying  the contents of  the
          speech and threatening  to prosecute  the speaker with  revealing
          classified information.  [cite coming].  

          3.  This  Note  will not  discuses  how  TEMPEST relates  to  the
          Warrant Requirement under  the United  States Constitution.   Nor
          will it discuss the Constitutional exclusion of foreign nationals
          from the Warrant Requirement.

          protecting  privacy  under  TEMPEST should  be  made  freely
          available;  TEMPEST  Certified equipment  should  be legally
          available; and organizations possessing  private information
          should  be  required  by  law  to protect  that  information
          through  good  computer security  practices  and the  use of
          TEMPEST Certified equipment.

                            I. INTELLIGENCE GATHERING
               Spying is divided by professionals into two main types:
          human   intelligence   gathering  (HUMINT)   and  electronic
          intelligence gathering (ELINT).  As  the names imply, HUMINT
          relies   on   human   operatives,   and  ELINT   relies   on
          technological operatives.   In the past HUMINT  was the sole
          method  for collecting intelligence.[4]   The HUMINT operative
          would  steal  important  papers, observe  troop  and  weapon
          movements[5],  lure people  into  his confidences  to  extract
          secrets,  and   stand  under   the  eavesdrip[6]   of  houses,
          eavesdropping on the occupants.  
               As  technology  has progressed,  tasks that  once could
          only  be  performed  by  humans  have  been  taken  over  by
          machines.  So  it has  been with spying.   Modern  satellite
          technology allows troop and weapons movements to be observed
          with greater  precision and  from greater  distances than  a
          human  spy  could ever  hope to  accomplish.   The  theft of
          documents  and  eavesdropping on  conversations  may now  be
          performed electronically.  This means greater safety for the
          human operative, whose  only involvement may be  the placing
          of  the  initial  ELINT  devices.    This  has  led  to  the
          ascendancy of ELINT  over HUMINT  because the placement  and

          4.  HUMINT  has  been  used  by  the   United  States  since  the
          Revolution.   "The necessity  of procuring  good intelligence  is
          apparent &  need not be further urged --  All that remains for me
          to add is, that you keep the  whole matter as secret as possible.
          For  upon Secrecy,  Success depends  in Most  Enterprises of  the
          kind, and for  want of it,  they are generally defeated,  however
          well planned &  promising a favorable  issue."  Letter of  George
          Washington (Jul. 26, 1777).

          5.  "... I wish  you to take every possible pains in your powers,
          by  sending  trusty persons  to  Staten  Island in  whom  you can
          confide,  to  obtain  Intelligence  of  the Enemy's  situation  &
          numbers --  what kind of  Troops they are,  and what  Guards they
          have -- their strength & where posted."  Id.

          6.  Eavesdrip is  an Anglo-Saxon  word,  and refers  to the  wide
          overhanging eaves used  to prevent rain  from falling close to  a
          house's foundation.   The eavesdrip  provided "a sheltered  place
          where  one  could hide  to  listen clandestinely  to conversation
          within the house."   W. MORRIS & M. MORRIS,  MORRIS DICTIONARY OF
          WORD AND PHRASE ORIGINS, 198 (1977).

          monitoring of ELINT devices may be performed by a technician
          who has  no training  in the  art of spying.   The  gathered
          intelligence  may be  processed by  an intelligence  expert,
          perhaps  thousands of  miles  away, with  no  need of  field
          experience.  
               ELINT has a number of other advantages over HUMINT.  If
          a  spy is caught his existence could embarrass his employing
          state and he could  be forced into giving up  the identities
          of his compatriots  or other important information.   By its
          very nature, a discovered ELINT device (bug)  cannot give up
          any information; and the ubiquitous  nature of bugs provides
          the  principle  state  with the  ability  to  plausibly deny
          ownership or involvement.
               ELINT   devices   fall  into   two   broad  categories:
          trespassatory  and  non-trespassatory.   Trespassatory  bugs
          require some type of trespass in order for them to function.
          A transmitter  might require  the physical  invasion of  the
          target  premises  for placement,  or  a microphone  might be
          surreptitiously attached  to  the outside  of a  window.   A
          telephone transmitter can  be placed  anywhere on the  phone
          line, including at the  central switch.  The trespass  comes
          either when it is physically attached  to the phone line, or
          if it is  inductive, when placed  in close proximity to  the
          phone line.   Even microwave  bugs require the  placement of
          the resonator cone within the target premises.[7]
               Non-trespassatory  ELINT  devices  work   by  receiving
          electromagnetic radiation (EMR) as  it radiates through  the
          aether, and do not  require the placement of bugs.   Methods
          include intercepting[8] information transmitted  by satellite,
          microwave, and  radio, including mobile  and cellular  phone
          transmissions.   This information was  purposely transmitted
          with the intent that  some intended person or  persons would
          receive it.  
               Non-trespassatory ELINT also includes  the interception
          of information that  was never  intended to be  transmitted.
          All electronic devices emit electromagnetic radiation.  Some
          of  the  radiation,  as  with radio  waves,  is  intended to
          transmit  information.    Much  of  this  radiation  is  not
          intended to transmit information and is merely incidental to

          8.  Interception  is  an  espionage  term of  art  and  should be
          differentiated from  its more common usage.   When information is
          intercepted, the interceptor  as well  as the intended  recipient
          receive the information.  Interception when not used as a term of
          art refers to one person receiving something intended for someone
          else; the intended recipient never receives what he  was intended
          to receive.

          whatever  work  the  target  device  is performing.[9]    This
          information  can be  intercepted  and reconstructed  into  a
          coherent  form.    With  current  TEMPEST technology  it  is
          possible to  reconstruct  the  contents  of  computer  video
          display  terminal  (VDU)  screens  from  up to  a  kilometer
          distant[10];  reconstructing  the  contents  of  a  computer's

          9.  There are  two types  of emissions,  conducted and  radiated.
          Radiated  emissions are formed  when components or  cables act as
          antennas for transmit the EMR; when radiation is conducted  along
          cables or other connections but not radiated it is referred to as
          "conducted".  Sources  include cables,  the ground loop,  printed
          circuit boards, internal  wires, the power  supply to power  line
          coupling, the cable to cable coupling, switching transistors, and
          high-power  amplifiers.    WHITE  &  M. MARDIGUIAN,  EMI  CONTROL
          METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURES,   10.1 (1985).
               "[C]ables  may act  as an  antenna to  transmit the  signals
          directly  or  even  both  receive the  signals  and  re-emit them
          further away  from the  source equipment.   It  is possible  that
          cables acting as an  antenna in such a manner could  transmit the
          signals  much  more  efficiently than  the  equipment  itself...A
          similar  effect  may occur  with metal  pipes  such as  those for
          domestic water supplies. ...  If an earthing [(grounding)] system
          is  not installed  correctly such  that there  is a  path  in the
          circuit  with a  very high  resistance (for  example  where paint
          prevents  conduction and  is acting  as an  insulator), then  the
          whole earthing  system could well act in  a similar fashion to an
          antenna. ...   [For a  VDU] the strongest  signals, or  harmonics
          thereof, are  usually between  60-250 MHz  approximately.   There
          have  however  been  noticeable  exception  of  extremely  strong
          emissions  in  the  television bands  and  at  higher frequencies
          between 450-800  MHz.  Potts,  Emission Security, 3  COMPUTER LAW
          AND SECURITY REPORT 27 (1988).

          10.  The TEMPEST ELINT operator can distinguish between different
          VDUs  in   the   same  room   because   of  the   different   EMR
          characteristics of both  homo and heterogeneous units.   "[T]here
          is little comparison  between EMR characteristics  from otherwise
          comparable equipment.   Only if the  [VDU] was made with  exactly
          the  same components  is there  any similarity.   If some  of the
          components have come from a different batch, have been updated in
          some   way,  and  especially   if  they  are   from  a  different
          manufacturer, then completely different results are obtained.  In
          this way a  different mark or version of the same [VDU] will emit
          different  signals.   Additionally  because  of the  variation of
          manufacturing standards between counties, two  [VDUs] made by the
          same  company  but  sourced  from  different counties  will  have
          entirely different EMR signal characteristics...From this  it way
          be thought that there is such a jumble of emissions  around, that
          it would not be possible to isolate those from any one particular
          source.  Again, this is not the case.  Most received signals have

          complicated and must be performed  from a closer distance.[11]
          The reconstruction  of information  via EMR,  a process  for
          which the  United States  government  refuses to  declassify
          either  the  exact  technique or  even  its  name[12], is  not
          limited to computers  and digital devices but  is applicable
          to  all devices  that generate  electromagnetic radiation.[13]
          TEMPEST is  especially effective  against VDUs  because they
          produce a very high level of EMR.[14]

          a  different  line synchronization,  due  to  design, reflection,
          interference or  variation of component  tolerances.  So  that if
          for  instance  there  are three  different  signals  on the  same
          frequency  ...  by  fine  tuning  of  the  RF  receiver,  antenna
          manipulation  and modification  of  line synchronization,  it  is
          possible to lock onto each of the three signals separately and so
          read  the  screen information.    By  similar techniques,  it  is
          entirely  possible  to discriminate  between individual  items of
          equipment in the same room."  Potts, supra note 9.

          11.  TEMPEST is  concerned  with  the  transient  electromagnetic
          pulses formed  by digital  equipment.   All electronic  equipment
          radiates  EMR  which  may be  reconstructed.    Digital equipment
          processes information as 1's and 0's--on's  or off's.  Because of
          this, digital equipment  gives off pulses  of EMR.  These  pulses
          are easier to  reconstruct at a  distance than the non-pulse  EMR
          given off by  analog equipment.   For a  thorough discussion  the
          radiation  problems  of  broadband digital  information  see e.g.
          military standard MIL-STD-461   REO2; White supra note 9,   10.2.

          13.       Of special interest  to ELINT  collectors are EMR  from

          14.     The  picture on  a  CRT screen  is  built up  of  picture
          elements  (pixels) organized  in lines  across the  screen.   The
          pixels  are made  of material  that fluoresces  when struck  with
          energy.  The energy is produced by a beam of electrons fired from
          an electron gun  in the back of  the picture tube.   The electron
          beam scans the screen of the  CRT in a regular repetitive manner.
          When the voltage of the beam is high then the pixel it is focused
          upon  emits  photons and  appears as  a  dot on  the screen.   By
          selectively firing  the gun as  it scans across  the face of  the
          CRT, the pixels form characters on the CRT screen.

               ELINT is not limited to  governments.  It is  routinely
          used by  individuals for  their  own purposes.   Almost  all
          forms of ELINT are  available to the individual with  either
          the technological  expertise or  the money  to hire  someone
          with  the  expertise.     Governments   have  attempted   to
          criminalize all use  of ELINT by their  subjects--to protect
          the privacy of both the government and the population.

               In the United States, Title III of  the Omnibus Streets
          and Crimes Act of 1968[15] criminalizes trespassatory ELINT as
          the intentional interception  of wire communications.[16]   As
          originally  passed,   Title  III   did  not  prohibit   non-

               The pixels  glow for  only a  very  short time  and must  be
          routinely struck by the electron beam  to stay lit.  To  maintain
          the light output of  all the pixels that are supposed  to be lit,
          the electron beam traverses  the entire CRT screen sixty  times a
          second.   Every time the beam fires it  causes a high voltage EMR
          emission.  This EMR  can be used  to reconstruct the contents  of
          the  target CRT  screen.   TEMPEST  ELINT  equipment designed  to
          reconstruct the information synchronizes its  CRT with the target
          CRT.  First, it uses the EMR to synchronize its electron gun with
          the electron gun in the target CRT.  Then, when the TEMPEST ELINT
          unit detects EMR indicating that the target CRT fired on a pixel,
          the TEMPEST ELINT  unit fires the electron  gun of its CRT.   The
          ELINT CRT is in perfect synchronism with the target CRT; when the
          target lights a pixel, a corresponding pixel on the TEMPEST ELINT
          CRT  is lit.  The exact picture on  the target CRT will appear on
          the TEMPEST ELINT  CRT.  Any changes on the target screen will be
          instantly reflected in the TEMPEST ELINT screen. 
               TEMPEST Certified equipment gives off emissions  levels that
          are too faint to  be readily detected.  Certification  levels are
          set   out  in   National   Communications  Security   Information
          Memorandum  5100A   (NACSIM  5100A).    "[E]mission   levels  are
          expressed in the time  and frequency domain, broadband or  narrow
          band  in terms of the frequency domain, and in terms of conducted

          communication lacked any expectation of p2IIIrivacy.[18]   The
          Electronic Communications  Privacy  Act  of  1986[19]  amended
          Title  III  to  include non-wire  communication.    ECPA was
          specifically  designed  to include  electronic  mail, inter-
          computer  communications,  and  cellular  telephones.     To
          accomplish  this,  the  expectation  of  privacy   test  was
          eliminated.[20]
               As  amended, Title  III  still outlaws  the  electronic
          interception of  communications.  The  word "communications"
          indicates  that   someone  is   attempting  to   communicate
          something to someone; it  does not refer to the  inadvertent
          transmission   of   information.       The   reception   and
          reconstruction of emanated transient  electromagnetic pulses
          (ETEP), however, is based on  obtaining information that the
          target does  not  mean to  transmit.   If  the ETEP  is  not
          intended as communication, and  is therefore not transmitted
          in a form approaching current communications protocols, then
          it can not  be considered communications as  contemplated by
          Congress  when  it   amended  Title  III.     Reception,  or
          interception, of emanated  transient electromagnetic  pulses
          is not criminalized by Title III as amended.

          communications on  a telecommunication line  can take  place
          with a physical tap on the line, or the passive interception
          of microwave or  satellite links.[23]  These  forms of passive
          interception  differ  from TEMPEST  ELINT  because  they are
          intercepting   intended    communication;   TEMPEST    ELINT
          intercepts unintended  communication.  Eavesdropping  on the
          emanations  of  computers does  not  in any  way  comport to
          tapping a telecommunication line and therefore falls outside
          the scope of the statute.[24]

          23.  Tapping  (aka  trespassatory eavesdropping)  is  patently in

          the Interception of Communications Act 1985 covers those forms of
          eavesdropping on computer communications  which involve "tapping"
          the wires along  which messages  are being passed.   One  problem
          which  may  arise,  however,  is  the  question  of  whether  the
          communication in question  was intercepted in  the course of  its
          transmission by  means of a public telecommunications system.  It
          is technically possible  to intercept a communication  at several
          stages in its transmission,  and it may be a question  of fact to
          decide the stage  at which it enters the "public" realm.  THE LAW

          criminalized indirect access  to a computer service.[25]   The
          specific reference  to an  "electromagnetic device"  clearly
          shows the intent  of the legislature  to include the use  of
          TEMPEST ELINT equipment within the ambit of the legislation.
               The limitation of obtaining "any computer service" does
          lead to  some confusion.   The Canadian legislature  has not
          made  it  clear  whether  "computer  service"  refers  to  a
          computer  service  bureau  or  merely   the  services  of  a
          computer.    If  the  Canadians  had  meant  access  to  any
          computer,  why  did they  refer  to any  "computer service".
          This   is   especially   confusing   considering   the   al-
          encompassing language  of (b)  'any function  of a  computer
          system'.
               Even   if   the   Canadian   legislation   criminalizes
          eavesdropping  on  all  computers,  it  does not  solve  the
          problem  of  protecting  the privacy  of  information.   The
          purpose  of  criminal law  is  to control  crime.[26]   Merely
          making  TEMPEST  ELINT  illegal will  not  control  its use.
          First, because  it  is an  inherently  passive crime  it  is
          impossible to detect and hence punish.  Second, making  this
          form of  eavesdropping  illegal without  taking a  proactive
          stance  in  controlling  compromising emanations  gives  the
          public a false sense of security.   Third, criminalizing the
          possession of a TEMPEST ELINT  device prevents public sector
          research into countermeasures.   Finally,  the law will  not
          prevent eavesdropping on private information held in company
          computers unless  disincentives are given for companies that
          do not take sufficient precautions against eavesdropping and
          simple, more common, information crimes.[27]

               TEMPEST ELINT  is passive.   The  computer or  terminal
          emanates  compromising radiation which is intercepted by the
          TEMPEST device  and reconstructed  into useful  information.
          Unlike conventional  ELINT there  is no  need to  physically
          trespass or even come near the target.  Eavesdropping can be
          performed from a nearby office or even a van parked within a
          reasonable distance.   This means  that there is  no classic
          scene of the crime; and little or  no chance of the criminal
          being discovered in the act.[28]  
               If the crime is discovered it will be ancillary to some
          other  investigation.    For example,  if  an  individual is
          investigated for insider  trading a search of  his residence
          may yield a TEMPEST ELINT device.   The device would explain
          how the defendant was obtaining  insider information; but it
          was the insider trading, not the  device, that gave away the
          crime.
               This  is  especially  true  for illegal  TEMPEST  ELINT
          performed by the state.  Unless the perpetrators are  caught
          in the act  there is  little evidence  of their  spying.   A
          trespassatory bug can be detected and located; further, once
          found it provides tangible evidence that a crime took place.
          A TEMPEST ELINT device by its inherent passive nature leaves
          nothing to detect.   Since the government is less  likely to
          commit an ancillary crime which might be detected there is a
          very small chance  that the spying will  ever be discovered.
          The  only way to  prevent eavesdropping is  to encourage the
          use of  countermeasures: TEMPEST  Certified[29] computers  and
          _____________________              
                                                                           
          collecting their pay are merely  age-old accounting frauds; today
          the  fraud involves a computer because  the records are kept on a
          computer.  The  computer is merely ancillary to  the crime.  This
          has been mislabeled  computer crime and should merely be referred
          to as a fraud perpetrated with  the aid of a computer.   Finally,
          there are information  crimes.  These  are crimes related to  the
          purloining or  alteration of information.  These  crimes are more
          common and more profitable due to  the computer's ability to hold
          and access great amounts of information.   TEMPEST ELINT can best
          be categorized as a information crime.

          28.  Compare, for  example, the  Watergate breakin  in which  the
          burglars  were discovered  when they  returned to  move  a poorly
          placed spread spectrum bug.

          29.  TEMPEST Certified refers  to the  equipment having passed  a
          testing and  emanations regime specified  in NACSIM 5100A.   This
          classified document sets forth the emanations levels that the NSA
          believes digital equipment can give  off without compromising the
          information it  is processing.   TEMPEST  Certified equipment  is
          theoretically secure against TEMPEST eavesdropping.  

<New Page>
          terminals.
               In merely making  TEMPEST ELINT  illegal the public  is
          given the  false impression  of security;  they lulled  into
          believing  the  problem  has been  solved.    Making certain
          actions illegal does not prevent them  from occurring.  This
          is  especially  true  for  a  TEMPEST  ELINT  because it  is
          undetectable.  Punishment is an empty  threat if there is no
          chance of being  detected; without detection there can be no
          apprehension and conviction.   The only way  to prevent some
          entity  from eavesdropping  on  one's  computer or  computer
          terminal is  for the equipment not to  give off compromising
          emanation; it must be TEMPEST Certified.
               The United  States can solve  this problem by  taking a
          proactive  stance on compromising  emanations.  The National
          Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST[30]) is in charge
          of  setting  forth standards  of  computer security  for the
          private  sector.   NIST  is  also charged  with  doing basic
          research to advance the art of computer security.  Currently
          NIST does not discuss TEMPEST with  the private sector.  For
          privacy's sake,  this policy must be changed  to a proactive
          one.  The NIST should publicize  the TEMPEST ELINT threat to
          computer  security and  should set  up a  rating system  for
          level  of  emanations  produced   by  computer  equipment.[31]
          Further,  legislation  should  be  enacted  to  require  the
          labeling  of  all computer  equipment    with  its level  of
          emanations and whether it is TEMPEST Certified.  Only if the
          public  knows of the  problem can it begin  to take steps to
          solve it.
               Title III makes  possession of a surveillance  device a
          crime,  unless  it   is  produced  under  contract   to  the
          government.  This means that  research into surveillance and
          counter-surveillance   equipment   is  monopolized   by  the
          government and a  few companies working under  contract with
          _____________________              
                                                                           
               NACSIM 5100A is  classified, as are all  details of TEMPEST.
          To  obtain  access to  it, contractor  must  prove that  there is
          demand within  the government for the specific  type of equipment
          that intend to  certify.  Since  the standard is classified,  the
          contractors can not sell the equipment to non-secure governmental
          agencies or the public.  This prevents reverse engineering of the
          standard  for its physical  embodiment, the  Certified equipment.
          By  preventing  the   private  sector  from  owning   this  anti-
          eavesdropping equipment,  the NSA has  effectively prevented  the
          them from protecting the information in their computers.

          the government.   If TEMPEST eavesdropping  is criminalized,
          then possession of TEMPEST ELINT equipment will be criminal.
          Unfortunately,this  does  not  solve the  problem.    Simple
          TEMPEST ELINT  equipment is easy  to make.   For just  a few
          dollars  many  older  television  sets  can be  modified  to
          receive and  reconstruct  EMR.    For less  than  a  hundred
          dollars a more  sophisticated TEMPEST ELINT receiver  can be
          produced[32].  
               The  problem  with  criminalizing  the  possession   of
          TEMPEST ELINT equipment is  not just that the law  will have
          little effect on the use of such equipment, but that it will
          have a  negative effect  on counter-measures  research.   To
          successfully   design   counter-measures  to   a  particular
          surveillance  technique  it  is  vital  to have  a  complete
          empirical  understanding   of  how  that   technique  works.
          Without  the right  to  legally manufacture  a  surveillance
          device there is no possible way for a researcher to have the
          knowledge to  produce an effective  counter-measures device.
          It  is  axiomatic:  without  a  surveillance device,  it  is
          impossible to test a counter-measures device.  
               A number of  companies produce  devices to measure  the
          emanations from electrical equipment.  Some of these devices
          are  specifically   designed  for   bench  marking   TEMPEST
          Certified equipment.  This does not  solve the problem.  The
          question  arises:  how   much  radiation  at   a  particular
          frequency  is compromising?  The  current answer is to refer

          to NACSIM  5100A.   This document  specifies the  emanations
          levels suitable  for Certification.   The  document is  only
          available  to United  States  contractors having  sufficient
          security  clearance  and  an  ongoing  contract  to  produce
          TEMPEST Certified computers  for the  government.   Further,
          the correct levels are specified by the NSA and there  is no
          assurance that, while these levels are sufficient to prevent
          eavesdropping by unfriendly operatives,  equipment certified
          under NACSIM  5100A will have  levels low enough  to prevent
          eavesdropping by the NSA itself.
               The  accessibility  of  supposedly  correct  emanations
          levels  does  not solve  the  problem of  preventing TEMPEST
          eavesdropping.     Access   to  NACSIM   5100A   limits  the
          manufacturer to selling the equipment  only to United States
          governmental  agencies  with  the  need  to  process  secret
          information.[33]  Without  the right to possess  TEMPEST ELINT
          equipment  manufacturers  who  wish to  sell  to  the public
          sector cannot determine what a  safe level of emanations is.
          Further  those  manufacturers with  access  to  NACSIM 5100A
          should  want  to  verify that  the  levels  set  out in  the
          document are, in  fact, low enough to  prevent interception.
          Without an actual  eavesdropping device with which  to test,
          no   manufacturer  will   be   able  to   produce  genuinely
          uncompromising equipment.

               Even if the  laws allow ownership of  TEMPEST Certified
          equipment by the public, and even  if the public is informed
          of  TEMPEST's   threat  to  privacy,   individuals'  private
          information will not necessarily  by protected.  Individuals
          may  choose to  protect their  own information on  their own
          computers.  Companies  may choose  whether to protect  their
          own  private  information.    But  companies that  hold  the
          private information of  individuals must  be forced to  take
          steps to protect that information.
               In  England  the  Data  Protection  Act 1984[34]  imposes
          sanctions   against   anyone   who   stores   the   personal

          courts  have not yet  ruled what level  of computer security
          measures  constitute  reasonable  care.     Considering  the
          magnitude of invasion possible with  TEMPEST ELINT it should
          be  clear  by now  that  failure  to use  TEMPEST  Certified
          equipment is prima facie unreasonable care.
               The Remedies section of the  act provides incentive for
          these  entities to provide  successful protection  of person
          data from disclosure  or illicit access.  Failure to protect
          the data will  result in monetary loss.  This  may be looked
          at from the economic efficiency  viewpoint as allocating the
          cost  of  disclosure the  persons  most able  to  bear those
          costs, and also most able to prevent disclosure.  Data users
          that  store   personal  data  would  use  TEMPEST  Certified
          equipment as part of their computer security plan, thwarting
          would-be eavesdroppers.  
               The Data Protection  Act 1984  allocates risk to  those
          who can  bear it best and provides  an incentive for them to
          keep other  individuals' data private.   This act  should be
          adopted by the United States as part of a full-spectrum plan
          to combat TEMPEST eavesdropping.  Data users are in the best
          position  to  prevent  disclosure  through  proper  computer
          security.    Only by  making  them  liable for  failures  in
          security can we begin to rein in TEMPEST ELINT.

                                       VII
                                 Recommendations
                 Do not  criminalize TEMPEST ELINT.   Most crimes that
          TEMPEST ELINT would aid, such a insider trading, are already
          illegal; the current laws are adequate.
                 The  National Institute of  Standards and  Technology
          should immediately begin  a program  to educate the  private
          sector about TEMPEST.  Only if  individuals are aware of the
          threat  can  they  take  appropriate precautions  or  decide
          whether any precautions are necessary.
                   Legislation  should  be   enacted  to  require  all
          electronic  equipment to  prominently display  its level  of
          emanations  and  whether  it  is   TEMPEST  Certified.    If
          individuals are to choose to protect themselves they must be
          able  to  make  a  informed   decision  regarding  how  much
          protection is enough.
                 TEMPEST  Certified equipment  should be available  to
          the private  sector.   The current  ban on  selling to  non-
          governmental  agencies  prevents  individuals  who  need  to
          protect information from having the technology to do so.
                 Possession of  TEMPEST ELINT equipment should  not be
          made  illegal.   The  inherently  passive nature  and simple
          design  of  TEMPEST ELINT  equipment  means that  making its
          possession illegal  will not deter  crime; the units  can be
          easily manufactured and are impossible  to detect.  Limiting
          their   availability   serves   only   to   monopolize   the
          countermeasures research, information, and equipment for the
          government;   this   prevents   the  testing,   design   and

<New Page>
          manufacture of counter-measures by the private sector.
                 Legislation mirroring  England's Data Protection  Act
          1984 should be  enacted.  Preventing disclosure  of personal
          data  can  only be  accomplished  by giving  those companies
          holding the data a reason to protect  it.  If data users are
          held liable for  their failure  to take reasonable  security
          precautions they  will  begin to  take  reasonable  security
          precautions,  including   the  use   of  TEMPEST   Certified
          equipment.
ust  be forced to  take
          steps to protect that information.

				Abstract

Eavesdropping on personal computers is not limited to looking over the
shoulder of the operator or physically tapping in to an Ethernet cable.
U.S. Government standards relating to the prevention of information capture
via the emission of electromagnetic radiation from computers and peripherals
are known as TEMPEST.  However, actual TEMPEST specifications are classified.
 
TEMPEST aside, there are inexpensive and easily applied means for
individuals to minimize unintentional emissions from equipment.  My document
"Preventing Electromagnetic Eavesdropping," discusses these techniques.

TEMPEST is the code name for technology related to limiting unwanted
electromagnetic emissions from data processing and related equipment.
Its goal is to limit an opponent's capability to collect information about
the internal data flow of computer equipment. Most information concerning
TEMPEST specifications is classified by the United States Government and
is not available for use by its citizens.

The reason why TEMPEST technology is particularly important for
computers and other data processing equipment is the kinds of signals
components in a computer use to talk to each other ("square waves") and
their clock speeds (measured in megahertz) produce a particularly rich set
of unintentional signals in a wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Because the spurious emissions occupy so wide a portion of that spectrum,
technologies used to block one portion of the spectrum (as pulling the shades 
closed on a window to stop the visible light portion) are not necessarily
effective in another portion.

Unintentional emissions from a computer system can be captured and
processed to reveal information about the target systems from simple
levels of activity to even remotely copying keystrokes or capturing
monitor information. It is speculated that poorly protected systems can
be effectively monitored up to the order of one kilometer from the target
equipment.

This note will examine some practical aspects of reducing the
susceptibility of your personal computer equipment to remote monitoring
using easily-installed, widely available after-market components.


   I

One way of looking at TEMPEST from the lay person's point-of-view is
that it is virtually identical to the problem of preventing electromagnetic
interference ("EMI") by your computer system to others' radios, televisions,
or other consumer electronics. That is, preventing the emission of wide-band
radio "hash" from your computers, cabling, and peripherals both prevents
interference to you and your neighbors television set and limits the useful
signal available to a person surreptitiously monitoring.

Viewing the problem in this light, there are quite a few useful documents
available form the government and elsewhere attacking this problem and
providing a wealth of practical solutions and resources. Very useful for the
lay person are:

Preventing unintended electromagnetic emissions is a relative term.
It is not feasible to reduce to zero all unintended emissions. My personal
goal, for example, might be to reduce the amount and quality of spurious
emission until the monitoring van a kilometer away would have to be in my
front yard before it could effectively eavesdrop on my computer. Apartment
dwellers with unknown neighbors only inches away (through a wall) might
want to even more carefully adopt as many of the following suggestions as
possible since signal available for detection decreases as approximately the
inverse square of the distance from the monitoring equipment to your computer.


   II
   Start with computer equipment that meets modern standards for emission.

In the United States, the "quietest" standard for computers and peripherals
is known as the "class B" level. (Class A level is a less stringent standard
for computers to be use in a business environment.).

You want to verify that all computers and peripherals you use meet the class
B standard which permits only one-tenth the power of spurious emissions than
the class A standard. If you already own computer equipment with an FCC ID,
you can find out which standard applies. Contact the FCC Consumers Assistance
Branch at 1-717-337-1212 for details in accessing their database.

Once you own good equipment, follow the manufacturer's recommendations for
preserving the shielding integrity of the system. Don't operated the system
with the cover off and keep "slot covers" in the back of the computer in
place.


   III
   Use only shielded cable for all system interconnections.

A shielded cable surrounds the core of control wires with a metal braid or
foil to keep signals confined to that core. In the late seventies it was common
to use unshielded cable such as "ribbon" cable to connect the computer with, 
say, a diskette drive. Unshielded cable acts just like an antenna for signals
generated by your computer and peripherals. Most computer manufacturer
supply shielded cable for use with their computers in order to meet FCC
standards. Cables bought from third-parties are an unknown and should be
avoided (unless you are willing to take one apart to see for yourself!)
	
Try to avoid a "rat's nest" of wire and cabling behind your equipment and
by keeping all cables as short as possible. You want to reduced the length of
unintended antennas and to more easily predict the likely paths of electric
and magnetic coupling from cable to cable so that it can be more effectively
filtered.


   IV
   Block radiation from the power cord(s) into the house wiring.

Most computers have an EMI filter built into their body where the AC
line cord enters the power supply. This filter is generally insufficient to
prevent substantial re-radiation of EMI voltages back into the power wiring
of your house and neighborhood. To reduce the power retransmitted down
the AC power cords of your equipment, plug them in to special EMI filters
that are in turn plugged into the wall socket. I use a model 475-3
overvoltage and EMI filter manufactured by

Industrial Communication Engineers, Ltd.
P.O. Box 18495
Indianapolis, IN  46218-0495
1-800-ICE-COMM
ask for their package of free information sheets

(AC and other filters mentioned in this note are available from a wide
variety of sources including, for example, Radio Shack. I am enthusiastic
about ICE because of the "over-designed" quality of their equipment.
Standard disclaimers apply.)

This particular filter from ICE is specified to reduce retransmission of
EMI by a factor of at least 1000 in its high-frequency design range. Although
ideally every computer component using an AC line cord ought to be filtered,
it is especially important for the monitor and computer CPU to be filtered in
this manner as the most useful information available to opponents is believed
to come from these sources.


   V
   Block retransmitted information from entering your fax/modem or 
   telephone line.

Telephone line is generally very poorly shielded. EMI  from your computer
can be retransmitted directly into the phone line through your modem or can
be unintentionally picked up by the magnetic portion of the EMI spectrum
through magnetic induction from power supplies or the yoke of your cathode
ray tube "CRT" monitor.

To prevent direct retransmission, EMI filters are specifically designed for
modular telephone jacks to mount at the telephone or modem, and for
mounting directly at the service entrance to the house.

Sources of well-designed telephone-line filter products include ICE
(address above) and

K-COM
Box 82
Randolph, OH  44265
216-325-2110

Your phone company or telephone manufacturer may be able to supply
you with free modular filters, although the design frequencies of these
filters may not be high enough to be effective through much of the EMI 
spectrum of interest. Keep telephone lines away from power supplies of
computers or peripherals and the rear of CRTs:  the magnetic field often
associated with those device can inductively transfer to unshielded lines
just as if the telephone line were directly electrically connected to them. 
Since this kind of coupling decreases rapidly with distance, this kind of
magnetic induction can be virtually eliminated by keeping as much distance
(several feet or more) as possible between the power supply/monitor yoke
and cabling.


   VI
   Use ferrite toroids and split beads to prevent EMI from escaping on
   the surface of your cables.

Ferrites are magnetic materials that,  for certain ranges of EMI
frequencies, attenuate the EMI by causing it to spend itself in heat in
the material rather than continuing down the cable. They can be applied
without cutting the cable by snapping together a "split bead" form over
a thick cable such as a power cord or by threading  thinner cable such as
telephone several times around the donut-shaped ferrite form. Every cable
leaving your monitor, computer, mouse, keyboard, and other computer
peripherals should have at least one ferrite core attentuator. Don't forget
the telephone lines from your fax, modem, telephone or the unshielded DC
power cord to your modem. Ferrites are applied as close to the EMI emitting
device as possible so as to afford the least amount of cable that can act as
an antenna for the EMI.

   Other practical remedies.

Other remedies that are somewhat more difficult to correctly apply
include providing a good EMI "ground" shield for your computer equipment
and other more intrusive filters such as bypass capacitor filters.

You probably ought not to think about adding bypass capacitors unless you
are familiar with electronic circuits and digital design. While quite
effective, added improperly to the motherboard or cabling of a computer they
can "smooth out" the square wave digital waveform -- perhaps to the extent
that signals are interpreted erroneously causing mysterious "crashes" of
your system. In other cases, bypass capacitors can cause unwanted parasitic
oscillation on the transistorized output drivers of certain circuits which
could damage or destroy those circuits in the computer or peripherals. Also,
unlike ferrite toroids, adding capacitors requires actually physically
splicing them in or soldering them into circuits. This opens up the
possibility of electric shock, damage to other electronic components or
voiding the warranty on the computer equipment.

A good EMI ground is difficult to achieve. Unlike an electrical safety
ground, such as the third wire in a three-wire AC power system, the EMI
ground must operate effectively over a much wider part of the EMI spectrum.
This effectiveness is related to a quality known as electrical impedance. You
desire to reduce the impedance to as low a value as possible over the entire
range of EMI frequencies. 
	
Unlike the AC safety ground, important factors in achieving low impedance
include having as short a lead from the equipment to a good EMI earth ground
as possible (must be just a few feet); the gauge of the connecting lead (the
best EMI ground lead is not wire but woven grounding "strap" or wide copper
flashing sheets; and the physical coupling of the EMI into the actual earth
ground. An 8 ft. copper-plated ground may be fine for AC safety ground, but
may present appreciable impedance resistance to an EMI voltage. Much better
would be to connect a network of six to eight copper pipes arranged in a
six-foot diameter circle driven in a foot or two into the ground,
electrically bonded together with heavy ground strap and connected to the
equipment to be grounded via a short (at most, several feet), heavy (at
least 3/4-1" wide) ground strap.
	
If you can achieve a good EMI ground, then further shielding possibilities
open up for you such as surrounding your monitor and computer equipment in a
wire-screen Faraday cage. You want to use mesh rather than solid sheet
because you must preserve the free flow of cooling air to your equipment.
Buy aluminum (not nylon) screen netting at your local hardware store. This
netting typically comes in rolls 36" wide by several feet long. Completely
surround your equipment you want to reduce the EMI being careful to make
good electrical bonds between the different panels of netting and your good
earth ground. I use stainless steel nuts, bolts, and lock washers along with
special non-oxidizing electrical paste (available from Electrical
contractors supply houses or from ICE) to secure my ground strapping to my
net "cages".  A good Faraday cage will add several orders of magnitude of
EMI attenuation to your system.


   VIII
   Checking the effectiveness of your work.

It is easy to get a general feeling about the effectiveness of your EMI
shielding work with an ordinary portable AM radio. Bring it very close to
the body of your computer and its cables in turn. Ideally, you should not
hear an increased level of static. If you do hear relatively more at one
cable than at another, apply more ferrite split beads or obtain better
shielded cable for this component. The practice of determining what kind of
operating system code is executing by listening to a nearby AM radio is
definitely obsolete for an well-shielded EMI-proof system!

To get an idea of the power and scope of your magnetic field emissions, an
ordinary compass is quite sensitive in detecting fields. Bring a compass
within a few inches of the back of your monitor and see whether it is
deflected. Notice that the amount of deflection decreases rapidly with
distance. You want to keep cables away from magnetic sources about as far as
required not to see an appreciable deflection on the compass.


   VIIII
   Summary

If you start with good, shielded equipment that has passed the FCC level B
emission standard then you are off to a great start. You may even be able to
do even better with stock OEM equipment by specifying "low-emission"
monitors that have recently come on the market in response to consumer fears
of extremely low frequency ("ELF") and other electromagnetic radiation.
Consistently use shielded cables, apply filtering and ferrite toroids to all
cabling entering or leaving your computer equipment. Finally, consider a
good EMI ground and Faraday cages. Beyond this there are even more effective
means of confining the electrical and magnetic components of your system
through the use of copper foil adhesive tapes, conductive paint sprays, "mu
metal" and other less common components.

shielding. There are many "leaky" spots, however, and most of these

Shielding is not difficult or complex; anyone can do it. Pop down
to your local magazine rack and get a mag on Amateur radio, look up
a mail order ham book place, and order a book on the subject.

As for personal computers, here's a few starting things to consider:

 o  Get a case that's made of steel, on all 6 sides.

 o  Get the highest quality shielded cables you can find. The GOOD
    commercial ones will have metal hoods on the connectors and
    little grounding pigtails. (If you pay $4.95 for a serial cable
    you have probably bought a good antenna).

 o  Ground the case and cables with SHORT ground wires, directly
    to a 10' copper ground rod just outside the wall.

 o  In a well-shielded system, the keyboard will emit the most RF,
    and it may be impossible to shield it adequately, tho the
    heavier, steel-base keyboards like Focus and Northgate are
    quieter than cheap plastic ones. The coily-cords radiate a
    lot, too. Replace your keyboard cable with a quality, straight,
    shielded one and ground it.

 o  Use a portable shortwave radio to check for leaks. Tune it first
    to your buss speed, then to processor speed. Then scan around
    for leaks on other frequencies. If you're *really* serious, drop
    2 grand+ on an RF spectrum analyzer. That's what any snoop
    would use to locate your emission frequencies.

Grounding and Shielding -- Misconceptions & things to know:

 o  A DC ground and an RF ground are not the same thing. A ground
    wire that is longer than 1/4 wavelength is an antenna, not a
    ground (regardless of what you ground it to). For example, a
    ground wire longer than 4.6 feet is an antenna at 50MHz.
    At 8 MHz, wires approaching 29 feet become antennas.
    Use 234/f (in mhz), then keep it quite a bit shorter than that.
    Obviously, you can't use your house grounding system, or cold
    water pipes, as RF grounds -- they're too long.

 o  Shielded multiconductor cables, and coax, are not really designed
    to stop all emissions of RF. They are designed to stop electrical
    interference from getting *into* the cable. If the shield of
    a cable is carrying RF (either by direct feed or induction from the
    wires within), it will radiate it at certain lengths, just like
    any other wire.

 o  Twists: The most effective way to stop cable RF radiation is to
    use cables that contain tightly twisted pairs of wires. This
    results in near-total phase cancellation. But it doesn't stop
    "common-mode" radiation. This is where RF at some frequency
    treats all wires in the cable as one. For example, 8 MHz buss
    noise may travel in-phase down your printer cable, to your
    printer chassis, to house ground, and back to your computer
    chassis. If this whole loop is => 29 feet, you'll radiate
    buss noise. The shield radiates either because it is carrying
    RF, or because the pairs inside are radiating and inducing
    RF on the shield.

 o  Ferrite toroids are available in a variety of sizes, and don't
    cost much. You probably already have some small ones in your
    power supply, on the input leads. These doughnuts will "eat"
    common-mode RF induction. You wrap several turns of the wire in
    question thru the doughnut. You can add these to your power supply
    (AC side), and all other wires leaving the computer case,
    including ground wires, keyboard, video, serial, parallel,
    LAN, and even speaker wires.

Notwithstanding all of the above, it is probably impossible to
pick up any *useful* information off of keyboards and monitors.
Networks, with their loooong data cables, are another matter.
Users needing tight security on networks should use fiber optics,
then apply all the stuff above to all pieces of hardware in the network.
