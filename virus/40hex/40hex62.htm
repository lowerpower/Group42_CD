                I'm back, well kind of.  Anyways, a lot of people have been
asking, "What's going on with the group?" The question should be, "What's going
on with any group these days?" It seems to me that 1992 was the death of h/p,
or at least the "ice age" of it.  Everybody was either getting busted or
quitting the scene.  Oh well, what can I say about it.  Our group has been
having bad luck too.  Five (now six) busted as well as other assorted bad
things happening to members.

                Anyways, what's going on with us, huh?.  Well the reason you
haven't heard much from us is because we haven't been releasing our new stuff
to BBS systems ( BBS system sounds as redundant as PIN number, I know) because
we have a strong feeling that members of such groups as the CVIA are logging on
to h/p boards in the hope of snatching the latest viruses.  Well not much you
can do about it if you run a BBS, unless you personnally know everyone who calls
your board. But come to think of it - what good does it prove to release your
newest creation to the general public (of the h/p crowd) via BBS system?  Isn't
that the same principle as the warez puppy scene?  I guess you all can do
whatever turns you on but we kind of decided that it would be in our best
interests to release our stuff to BBS's only after they have been detected by
the popular scanners or until they are kind of old.  Not to fear, 40-HEX and
"Dark Angel Phunky Writing Guide" will still be on boards at the same rate as
always.

                As for all of you people bitching that no longer have sites
and that we are dead, well your dead - wrong.  The current sites are as follows
(in no specific order) - Digital Warfare (yes it's back, at a new number
however), Time Lords BBS (The U.S.S.R System), The Phunline (yes it's back),
and the newest addition - Crow Technology.  And as for us being dead yeah
right.

** Note from DecimatoR:
The U.S.S.R System recently went down, due to Time Lord getting into a little
hot water.  It WILL return however... we're just not sure when. **

** Note from GHeap:
I am coming back, gimme mo' time!

                So now with that out of the way, on the other news.  Hmmm.....
Michelangelo caused quite a scare there for a while.  It was pretty cool
to see John, Patti, and the rest of the crew on T.V... John Dvorak has a new
half hour computer talk show on syndicated radio.  I'm sure he wouldn't mind if
we got on the show some time soon.  Check your local radio guide for your local
station and time... I am offering a standing bounty of $1,500 for the person
willing to fly to Ohio and kick Crow Meisters ass for good.  A minor would be
preferred, being that he is under 18 and if I smashed him I could get sued or
something.  Just kidding, Crow Meister is cool with me, hihihihi... A new
federal law is being considered which if passed will outlaw the authorship of
computer viruses totally, research or not.  Read more about that later in this
issue... Hey, I might have a BBS up soon!  I have been saying that for the past
2 years haven't I?  Well that's the news as I see it, it's nice to be writing
for this rag again. 

        Check ya in 25 to life....

                     - We need Computer Virus Snitches -
               Written By Mike Royko, Tribune Media Services.
                       Retyped by The Attitude Adjuster

 ============================================================================        
         Millions  of computer users are wondering how to protect themselves
 against  the wave of viruses that are threatening their machines. I have  a
 suggestion.[So do I, avoid Bnu 1.90Beta]
         First, they  should  remember  that these viruses don't spring from
 nature. They  are  little  computer  programs  that are created and sent on
 their  way  by people  that are brainy,  malicious and  arrogant.[I am  not
 brainy]
         So,  the  question is,  how  do you  find  the creators of computer
 virus programs?
         Because  they are  arrogant, it's  likely that they want someone to
 know what a clever thing they have done. They won't hold a press conference
 [Actually, we do hold press conferences.  See Michael Alexander@Computerworld]
 but  chances  are they  will brag  to a  trusted friend  or acquaintance or
 fellow hacker.
         It is sad, but the world is full of snitches.[Get a thesaurus] Look
 at John Gotti,  the nation's  biggest Mafia boss.  There was a time when it
 was  unthinkable for  even the lowest-level Mafia soldier to blab.  But now
 Gotti has to sit in court while his former  right-hand  man tells about how
 they got people whacked.  [We whack people too]
         So if Mafia  figures can be persuaded to tattle[Na-na-na-na-na], is
 there any reason  to believe that nerds  have a greater  sense of honor and
 loyalty?  [Yes, we also have brains]
        Of course[.] not, but how do you get them to do it?

        Money. [Now yer talking... my mom is really the Dark Avenger, I want
 my money now.]

        These  companies [what companies,  I only  hit hospitals]  could use
 petty cash  to place  ads in the  computer magazines and on  the electronic
 bulletin boards.  [Ok, call my BBS and  post this tidbit.  40Hex now has ad
 space available]
        The  ads  would  say  something  like: "A  $50,000  reward  for  any 
 information leading to the arrest and conviction of virus authors."
 [How can you convict a virus author. It isn't illegal.  Go play Tank Wars.]
        The  next question  would be  what to  do with the virus makers once
 they  have been  caught. And  that's  the  key  to putting  an  end to  the
 problem:  something  that could  be  posted  on  those electronic  bulletin
 boards  that  might cause  an aspiring  virus-maker to go take a brisk walk
 instead.
         A judge  would sit  and listen  to an  attorney who would say some-
 thing like this:
         "Your  honor,  what we  have here  is an  otherwise  fine young man
 from  a good  family. His  father is  a brilliant scholar, and the son will
 someday be the same."[I am going to be a certified scholar when I grow up.]
         "What  he did  was no  more than  an intellectual prank, a cerebral
 challenge of  sorts. Like  the man who climbed Mount Everest because it was
 there, he created the virus and sent it fourth because it was there."
         Then, we can hope, the judge might say something like this:
         "Yes,  I am  impressed  by  the  defendant's  brain  power.  And  I
 expected you to ask me to give him a slap on the wrist."
         "However,  he  is  not  a child.  He is an adult. And I would think
 that  so  brilliant a  grown  man would  know better  than to amuse himself
 by screwing with the lives of strangers."  [I haven't screwed one stranger]
         "It's  as if  he hid  inside  the businesses and institutions until
 they  were closed  and  everyone had  gone home. Then  he came out and went
 through  every  filing cabinet  and drawer and shredded or burned every bit
 of useful information he could find."[Cool! Lets try it.]
         "Now,  counselor, what  would you and your law partners say is some
 street mope [See Thesaurus] did that  to your firm - crept in and destroyed
 every document in your offices? Including the names of clients that owe you
 money. Hah, you would be in here asking me to hang him from a tree."[I love
 hanging from trees]
         "So  don't  give  me that  smart  kid  from  a good family routine.
 [I ain't smart, and family ain't good] He is a self-centered,  insensitive,
 uncaring,  arrogant goofball  [And  damn proud].  He didn't  give a  second
 thought to the  chaos or  heartbreak he would  cause an adoption  agency, a
 hardworking businessman or a medical clinic." [Yes I did.  I aim for them.]
         "Therefore,  I sentence him  to the maximum sentence the law allows
 in the local jailhouse [0, NUL, ZIP-o, /dev/null, etc..], which is a really
 terrible place, filled with all sorts of crude, insensitive hulks."
 [Jay-walkers]
         "Bailiff,  please get the defendent up off the floor and administer 
 some smelling salts."[More like, why is the defendant laughing?]
         "And change his trousers, quickly."[Fuck you]

                I hope you enjoyed that one as much as I did! Okay, I
        see some really neat things with this man's article. First off,
        I'm sure he's an adept programmer... that is, he can probably
        figure out how to get his VCR to tape something while he is
        off writing his brilliant articles. I enjoy his narrow-minded
        definition of virii (that was mentioned in 40Hex 5), of course,
        all virii are those evil overwriting, trigger date, resident,
        boot track infecting swine (yeah, he probably learned what a
        virus was from watching ABC News covering the Michaelangelo
        crisis!)
                I also enjoy his opinion that all virus authors are
        nerds.  First off, what the hell is a nerd?  I mean, I have
        written a virus before (not saying it was any good), but, I
        don't feel like a nerd!  In fact, I feel quite superior to
        most of the idiots like this guy.  And, I like his great
        statement about my loyalty.  Yes, I'm gonna narc on [PHALCON/
        [Forget this again, and die]]SKISM for $50,000!!! Yeah, right.
        There are a lot of narcs on this not-so good earth, so choose
        your friends wisely.
                I'm quite sure that ads on BBS's (electronic bulletin
        boards! No... cork ones!) would just sufficiently pump up user
        discussion of virii.  I'm not scared of fed intervention, and
        I doubt any authors I know are either.
                This was touched on in 40Hex 5, virus authors are not
        responsible for the spread of their virii unless they are
        actively spreading them!  I mean, it's not my fault that K-Rad
        Man sent my Hard Drive Blender (slices, dices, minces sectors)
        to 1000 Bible boards in Utah. Apparently it hasn't dawned on
        this guy that most virii are not written to be destructive.
        Actually, that's a lie.  There are a lot of virii out there that
        are descructive, but that is changing.  People like the
        PHALCON/SKISM crew realize that not everything must be
        destructive, opening the doors to much larger virus projects
        (ie Bobisms)
                One more thing... QUIT EQUATING THE WORD 'hacker' TO
        EVERY DAMN TYPE OF ELECTRONIC 'crime!!!'


                I'm gonna get this dude's phone #, I say we call him
        sometime...

     Lets see what good ole' Patty has to say about this:


 Virus Name:  Kennedy
 Aliases:     Dead Kennedy, 333, Kennedy-333
 Scan ID:     [Kennedy]
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  April, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth; message on trigger dates (see text);
              crosslinking of files; lost clusters; FAT corruption
 Origin:      Denmark
 Eff Length:  333 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCKF - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC, F-Prot, VirHunt 2.0+,
                    NAV, IBM Scan 2.00+, AVTK 4.32+, VIRx 1.6+, CPAV 1.0+,
                    Novi 1.0.1+, Sweep 2.3.1+, UTScan
 Removal Instructions:  F-Prot, VirHunt 2.0+, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Kennedy virus was isolated in April 1990.  It is a generic
       infector of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM.

       This virus has three activation dates: June 6 (assassination of
       Robert Kennedy 1968), November 18 (death of Joseph Kennedy 1969),
       and November 22 (assassination of John F. Kennedy 1963) of any year.
       On activation, the virus will display a message the following
       message:

               "Kennedy is dead - long live 'The Dead Kennedys'"

       The following text strings can be found in the viral code:

               "\command.com"
               "The Dead Kennedys"

       Systems infected with the Kennedy virus will experience
       cross-linking of files, lost clusters, and file allocation table
       errors (including messages that the file allocation table is bad).

  Ok there it is.  Not the most impressive virus around and its caught by just
about every scan on the market, but take PKLite to it and then remove the PKLite
header (Use NOLITE in this issue) and no one will be able to find it.  Anyway it
gets the job done.

The Cornell Daily Sun reported in this morning's issue that two
Cornell University sophomores, David Blumenthal and Mark Pilgrim, were
arrested Monday evening and arraigned in Ithaca City Court on one
count each of second degree computer tampering, in connection with the
release of the MBDF virus that infected Macs worldwide over the last
several days.  The two are being held in Tompkins County Jail.

"Computer Virus Traced to Cornell Students"

by Jeff Carmona

[The Cornell Daily Sun, 25 February 1992]

  Two Cornell students were arrested yesterday for allegedly creating and
launching *< launching ? Bon voyage, we launched you !>* a computer virus that
crippled computers around the world, according to M. Stuart Lynn, the
University's vice president for information technologies.
  David Blumenthal '94 and Mark Pilgrim '94 were arrested by Department of
Public Safety officers and arraigned in Ithaca City Court on one count of
second-degree computer tampering, a misdemeanor, *< cool, its only a
misdemeanor, how bad could it be ? >* Lynn said.
  Both students were remanded to the Tompkins County Jail and remained in
custody early this morning. They are being held on $2,000 cash or $10,000
bail bond, officials said.
  Cornell received national attention in Nov. 1988 when Robert T. Morris
Jr., a former graduate student, was accused of unleashing a computer virus
into thousands of government and university computers.
  Morris, convicted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, was fined
$10,000, given a three-year probation and ordered to do 400 hours of community
service by a federal judge in Syracuse, according to Linda Grace-Kobas,
*< Whats a Koba?? >* director of the Cornell News Service.
  Lynn would not compare the severity of the current case with Morris',
saying that "each case is different."
  Lynn said the virus, called "MBDFA" was put into three Macintosh games --
Obnoxious Tetris, Tetriscycle and Ten Tile Puzzle.
  On Feb. 14, the games were launched from Cornell to a public archive at
Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif, Lynn said.
*< I guess these guys actually put it up on the archive under their own      >*
*< accounts! Don't they know they can trace that stuff? duhhh...             >*
From there, the virus spread to computers in Osaka, Japan and elsewhere around
the world *< the archive was a dumb idea if thats how they got caught, but it
spread like hell >* when users connected to computer networks via modems, he
added. It is not known how many computers the virus has affected worldwide, he
explained.
  When computer users downloaded the infected games, the virus caused "a
modification of system software," *< oooh...lets not get too technical >* Lynn
said. "This resulted in unusual behavior and system crashes," he added.
  Lynn said he was not aware of anyone at Cornell who reported finding the
virus on their computers.
  The virus was traced to Cornell last Friday, authorities were quickly
notified and an investigation began, Lynn said.
  "We absolutely deplore this kind of bahavior," Lynn said. "We will pursue
this matter to the fullest."
  Armed with search warrants, Public Safety investigators removed more than
a dozen crates full of evidence from the students' residences in Baker and
Founders halls on West Campus. *< sounds like a typical, over-kill bust to
me.  If you don't know what it is, take it. >*
Public Safety officials refused to disclose the contents of the crates or
issue any comment about the incident when contacted repeatedly by phone last
night.  *< thats because they don't know what the fuck the stuff is >*
  "We believe this was dealt with very quickly and professionally," Lynn
said.
  The suspects are scheduled to appear in Ithaca City Court at 1 p.m. today
and additional charges are pending, according to Grace-Kobas.
  Because spreading a computer virus violates federal laws, "conceivably,
the FBI could be involved," she added. Officials with the FBI could not be
reached to confirm or deny this.
  Blumenthal and Pilgrim, both 19-year-olds, were current student employees
at Cornell Information Technologies (CIT), Lynn said. He would not say
whether the students launched the virus from their residence hall rooms or
From a CIT office.
  Henrik N. Dullea '61, vice president for University relations, said he
thinks "the act will immediately be associated with the University," not
only with the individual students charged.
  Because a major virus originated from a Cornell student in the past, this
latest incident may again "bring a negative reaction to the entire
institution," Dullea said. *< "blah, blah, blah" >*
  "These are very selfish acts," Lynn said, referring to the intentional
distribution of computer viruses, because innocent people are harmed.
  Lynn said he was unaware of the students' motive for initiating the virus.
Lynn said CIT put out a notice yesterday to inform computer users about the
"very virulent" virus. A virus-protection program, such as the new version of
Disinfectant, can usually cure computers, but it may be necessary to "rebuild
the hard drive" *< egad! Not the dreaded "virus-that-makes-you-rebuild-your-
hard-drive" !>* in some cases, he added.
  A former roommate of Blumenthal said he was not surprised by news of the
arrest. Computers were "more than a hobby" for Blumenthal, said Glen Fuller
'95, his roommate from last semester. "He was in front of the computer all
day," Fuller said.
  Blumenthal, who had a modem, would "play around with viruses because they
were a challenge to him," Fuller said. He said that, to his knowledge,
Blumenthal had never released a virus before.

________________________________________________________________________
NAME:     MBDF A virus
PLATFORM: Macintosh computers-except MacPlus and SE (see below)
DAMAGE:   May cause program crashes
SYMPTOMS: Claris applications indicate they have been altered; some
          shareware may not work, unexplained system crashes
DETECTION &
ERADICATION: Disinfectant 2.6,Gatekeeper 1.2.4, Virex 3.6,
             VirusDetective 5.0.2, Rival 1.1.10, SAM 3.0
________________________________________________________________________
                     Critical Facts about MBDF A

A new Macintosh virus, MBDF A, (named for the resource it exploits)
has been discovered.  This virus does not appear to maliciously cause
damage, but simply copies itself from one application to another.
MBDF A was discovered at two archive sites in newly posted game
applications, and has a high potential to be very widespread.

Infection Mechanism

This virus is an "implied loader" virus, and it works in a similar
manner to other implied loader viruses such as CDEF and MDEF.  Once
the virus is active, clean appliacation programs will become infected
as soon as they are executed.  MBDF A infects only applications, and
does not affect data files.  This virus replicates under both System 6
and System 7.  While MBDF A may be present on ALL types of Macintosh
systems, it will not spread if the infected system is a MacPlus or a
Mac SE (although it does spread on an SE/30).

Potential Damage

The MBDF A virus has no malicious damaging characteristics, however,
it may cause programs to inexplicably crash when an item is selected
from the menu bar.  Some programs, such as the shareware
"BeHierarchic" program, have been reported to not operate correctly
when infected.  Applications written with self-checking code, such as
those written by the Claris corporation, will inform the user that
they have been altered.

When MBDF A infects the system file, it must re-write the entire
system file back to disk; this process may take two or three minutes.
If the user assumes the system has hung, and reboots the Macintosh
while this is occuring, the entire system file will be corrupted and
an entire reload of system software must then be performed.

This virus can be safely eradicated from most infected programs,
although CIAC recommends that you restore all infected files from an
uninfected backup.

Detection and Eradication

Because MBDF A has been recently discovered, only anti-viral packages
updated since February 20, 1992 will locate and eradicate this virus.
All the major Macintosh anti-viral product vendors are aware of this
virus and have scheduled updates for their products.  These updates
have all been available since February 24, 1992.  The updated versions
of some products are Disinfectant 2.6, Gatekeeper 1.2.4, Virex 3.6,
SAM 3.0, VirusDetective 5.0.2, and Rival 1.1.10.  Some Macintosh
applications (such as the Claris software mentioned above) may contain
self-verification procedures to ensure the program is valid before
each execution; these programs will note unexpected alterations to
their code and will inform the user.

MBDF A has been positively identified as present in two shareware
games distributed by reliable archive sites: "Obnoxious Tetris" and
"Ten Tile Puzzle".  The program "Tetricycle" (sometimes named
"Tetris-rotating") is a Trojan Horse program which installs the virus.
If you have downloaded these or any other software since February 14,
1992 (the day these programs were loaded to the archive sites), CIAC
recommends that you acquire an updated version of an anti-viral
product and scan your system for the existence of MBDF A.

PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY CORNELL NEWS SERVICE 2/25/91

Students charged
with releasing
computer virus

By Linda Grace-Kobas

Following a university investigation that tracked a computer virus and
its originators, two Cornell students were arrested and charged with
computer tampering for allegedly launching a computer virus embedded in
three games into national computer archives.  Arraigned Feb. 24 in
Ithaca City Court were David S. Blumenthal, 19, a sophomore in the
College of Engineering, and Mark Andrew Pilgrim, 19, a sophomore in the
College of Arts and Sciences.  They were charged with computer tampering
in the second degree, a Class A misdemeanor.  The pair is being held in
Tompkins County Jail with bail set at $2,000 cash bond or $10,000
property bond.  At a hearing Tuesday afternoon, Judge Sherman returned
the two to jail with the same bond and recommended that they remain in
jail until at least Friday pending the federal investigation.  A
preliminary hearing is set for April 10.

Both students were employed by Cornell Information Technologies, which
runs the university's computer facilities.  Pilgrim worked as a student
operator in an Apple Macintosh facility from which the virus is believed
to have been launched.  The university's Department of Public Safety is
working with the Tompkins County district attorney's office, and
additional charges are expected to be filed.  The Federal Bureau of
Investigation has contacted the university to look at possible violations
of federal laws, officials said.  The Ithaca Police Department is also
assisting in the investigation.

"We absolutely abhor this type of behavior, which appears to violate the
university's computer abuse policy as well as applicable state and
federal law," commented M. Stuart Lynn, vice president for information
technologies, who headed the investigation to track the originators of
the virus.  "Cornell will pursue all applicable remedies under our own
policies and will cooperate with law enforcement authorities."

Lynn said Cornell was alerted Feb. 21 that a Macintosh computer virus
embedded in versions of three computer games, Obnoxious Tetris,
Tetricycle and Ten Tile Puzzle, had possibly been launched through a
Cornell computer.  A virus is normally embedded in a program and only
propagates to other programs on the host system, he explained.
Typically, when an infected application is run, the virus will attack the
system software and then other applications will become infected as they
are run.

The virus, MBDF-A, had been deposited on Feb. 14 directly and indirectly
into several computer archives in the U.S. and abroad, including
SUMEX-AIM at Stanford University and archives at the University of Texas,
the University of Michigan and another in Osaka, Japan.  These archives
store thousands of computer programs available to users of Internet, the
worldwide computer network.

Macintosh users who downloaded the games to their computers were subject
to a variety of problems, notably the modification of system software and
application programs, resulting in unusual behavior and possible system
crashes.  Apparently, there was no intent to destroy data, Lynn said, but
data could be destroyed in system crashes.

Reports of the virus have been received from across the United States and
around the world, including Wales, Britain, Lynn said, adding that he has
no estimate for the number of individuals who might have obtained the
games.

As soon as the virus was identified, individuals and groups across the
country involved with tracking viruses sent messages across computer
networks to alert users who might have been affected by the virus, Lynn
added.  The virus has since been removed from all archives and
"disinfectant" software available to the Internet community has been
modified so that individual Macintosh users can purge their computers of
it.

"Our sense is that the virus was controlled very rapidly," he said.  In
1988, Cornell received national attention when graduate student Robert T.
Morris Jr. launched a computer virus into important government and
university research networks.  That virus, actually considered a "worm"
since it was self-perpetuating, caused major damage in high-level
systems.  Morris was convicted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act and fined $10,000, given three years probation and ordered to do 400
hours of community service by a federal judge in Syracuse, N.Y.

The new virus differs greatly from the Morris worm, Lynn said.  "This
virus is not to be compared with the Morris worm, which independently
moved from machine to machine across the network," he explained.  All
Macintosh users should take appropriate measures to be certain their
systems are not infected with the virus.

Introduction:
-------------
 
    Recently I began to wonder about the usefulness of 'virus scanners'
and what if any difference do they have with a simple text/hex search
program (like nortons filefind/ts). An if there was no real DIFFERENCE,
how secure is the system that used them.
 
Problems with scanning:
-----------------------
 
    The first question I had to ask was, What does a 'virus scanner' actually
look for? Does it only look for one string of codes or several at different
places in the file?
 
    To answer this question I called a local BBS an dl'ed McAfee's
scan3.7v64 (to evaluate and after my tests, it was erased for its lack of
offering any real protection). Then I went to my archives to retrieve some
viruses I have experimented with in the past (of which where Jerusalem B and
Dark Avenger).
 
    I ran scan to verify that the virus files where viruses (3 of which did
not set off any alarm even tho there was a listing in the documentation for
them, so I removed them from the test). Then using a sector editor looked at
the source for the McAfee asso. scan3.7v64 (here after know just as scan64)
to find that the footprint information was encoded. Needless to say this did
not stop me (for the sake of those who are into the tech aspects of things,
the actual method used to get the codes are included at the end of the
article with the codes found), It took less than an hour to get the codes I
was looking for (without disassembling the code but by looking into the
memory allocated to the program).
 
    What I found out was scan was just a simple hex searcher (that kept
its data locked up till needed). It could also be fooled by any program
that contained the same hex string as a real virus (this was proved when
, using a sector editor, I added the scan64 footprint for the Jerusalem B
into the top of a text file (a place this code would never show up in a real
infection) then renamed it to *.com; scan64 reported it as infected).
 
    Once the codes where obtained, using debug directly on a virus file,
I was able to mutate the virus to no longer be detectable by scan64 without
destroying the integrity of it. For the virus was still able to infect files,
and scan64 could no longer track it. I was still able to track and control it
using norton's filefind, diskmon, diskedit, and (of course) DOS erase.
 
    So it seems my question was answered. Some 'virus scanners' just scan
for a single string of hex character. This is fine if viruses NEVER changed
or programs would NEVER use code similar to what a virus would (the smaller
the footprint string the bigger the chance of mistaken alarms). For if
a 'virus scanner' programer just keeps making a new release each time there
is a new virus (an I will not get into the morality of charging customers
the full price of an software upgrade rather than allowing them to buy/dl
new footprint data files as they become available) for the program will
eventually grow to unwealdable sizes. An it should be noted there are other
programs that may do the same job faster, more upward compatibility, and
you may already have them on hand.
 
a possible solution:
--------------------
 
    One thing that I think is a good idea is when a program allows users
to add new footprint data to it (like nortons' virus package). For now
users don't need to buy new releases for detection of viruses they may not
get/be able to detect. Instead for the cost of a call to a support bbs (part
of the original software agreement?) the user can get new data as it becomes
available or when they fine a new one on their system they can immediately
add the new footprint rather than wait for the next version to be released.
 
Method used to obtain footprints:
---------------------------------
 
    After finding the data I was looking for was encoded I thought, How can
I get the data I wanted for my tests?
 
    Disassembling was out, not for any MORAL reason but, for the time
involved. So I thought it must have to decode the data for it's own use
and to save time it would do it all before the scan rather than slow the
process down by doing a full decode. So I needed to look at the memory
image of the running program. Thanks to DOS 5.0 and dosshell I was able to
do this.
 
    After spawning the scan task under the dos shell I used alt-tab to
swap back to the shell. Once back in the shell I used the shell commands to
copy the  tmpxxx.swp to foo.img and terminating scan64 and dosshell.
 
    Then using a sector editor I searched though the temp file created by
the dos shell. I found an area of data that contained the virus names and
non ascii text data separating them. Even though the strings of ascii data
(virus names) ended with a zero character (as variable strings have a
tendency to), the random data did not end with a common signal character (as
expected for code can be any character). There was also no character count
stored (the data length varied so it could not be assumed by the scan
program as well). So I continued to search though the data.
 
    I eventually found another area that had the same text strings (virus
names). This time the first character of the none ascii data gave the count
of the data size to the following text string. I knew I had found it so I
extracted this data to another file (starting at 0 offset in the new file).
Then wrote down the some codes and checked them against viruses I had.
 
    The codes I had did not seem match. This did not stop me. I took one
virus (that my understanding said scan was only looking for 6 consecutive
bytes to match) and started zapping bytes (in a file scan said was infected)
to find what it was looking for. The processes involved zapping one sector
at a time till scan said it was not infected, then half of that sector, then
half of a half, and so on. It came down to 6 CONSECUTIVE bytes as I expected.
But they where DIFFERENT from the ones I had.
 
    So I went to the windows calculator (it allows byte arithmetic in hex,
ie.. 0xff + 0x04 = 0x03 (rollover, carry is ignored), it would be outside
the scope of this ARTICLE to explain why I thought byte arithmetic was
important). Some quick subtraction found a 0x93 (decimal 147) DIFFERENCE
between the actual codes and the ones from the allocated memory uses by
scan.
 
    So taking another virus that scan said was infected I did the minor
hex math on the codes in the allocated memory used by scan and found the
codes. Then i zapped only the codes and ran scan on the updated virus file.
It said there was no infection. I knew I now had the right codes (after a few
more checks).
 
    So I created a simple C program (see below) to convert the extract file I
 created and converted the codes to a readable form (output from program
listed at end of ARTICLE). Then tested other viruses against the list. An
found the same results.
