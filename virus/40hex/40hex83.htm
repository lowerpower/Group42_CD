                    An Introduction to Nonoverwriting Virii
                            Part II: EXE Infectors
                                 By Dark Angel
                    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
  
       In the  last issue  of 40Hex,  I presented  theory and  code  for  the
  nonoverwriting  COM   infector,  the   simplest  of  all  parasitic  virii.
  Hopefully, having  learned COM  infections cold,  you are now ready for EXE
  infections.  There is a grey veil covering the technique of EXE infections,
  as the majority of virii are COM-only.
  
       EXE infections  are, in  some  respects,  simpler  than  COM  viruses.
  However, to  understand the infection, you must understand the structure of
  EXE files  (naturally).   EXE files  are structured into segments which are
  loaded consecutively  atop one  another.  Thus, all an EXE infector must do
  is create  its own  segment in  the EXE  file and  alter  the  entry  point
  appropriately.   Therefore, EXE  infections do  not require  restoration of
  bytes of  code, but  rather involve  the manipulation  of the  header which
  appears in  the beginning every EXE file and the appending of viral code to
  the infected file.  The format of the header follows:
  
   Offset Description
     00   ID word, either 'MZ' or 'ZM'
     02   Number of bytes in the last (512 byte) page in the image
     04   Total number of 512 byte pages in the file
     06   Number of entries in the segment table
     08   Size of the header in (16 byte) paragraphs
     0A   Minimum memory required in paragraphs
     0C   Maximum memory requested in paragraphs
     0E   Initial offset in paragraphs to stack segment from header
     10   Initial offset in bytes of stack pointer from stack segment
     12   Negative checksum (ignored)
     14   Initial offset in bytes of instruction pointer from code segment
     16   Initial offset in paragraphs of code segment from header
     18   Offset of relocation table from start of file
     1A   Overlay number (ignored)
  
  The ID  word is  generally 'ZM'  (in the  Intel little-endian format).  Few
  files start  with the  alternate form,  'MZ' (once  again in  Intel little-
  endian format).   To  save space, a check for the alternate form of the EXE
  ID in  the virus  may be omitted, although a few files may be corrupted due
  to this omission.
  
  The words  at offsets  2 and  4 are related.  The word at offset 4 contains
  the filesize  in pages.   A  page is  a 512 byte chunk of memory, just as a
  word is  a two  byte chunk of memory.  This number is rounded up, so a file
  of length  514 bytes  would contain a 2 at offset 4 in the EXE header.  The
  word at offset 2 is the image length modulo 512.  The image length does not
  include the  header length.   This  is one of the bizarre quirks of the EXE
  header.   Since the header length is usually a multiple of 512 anyway, this
  quirk usually  does not  matter.  If the word at offset 2 is equal to four,
  then it  is generally  ignored (heck,  it's never really used anyway) since
  pre-1.10 versions  of the  Microsoft linker had a bug which caused the word
  to always  be equal  to four.  If you are bold, the virus can set this word
  to 4.   However, keep in mind that this was a bug of the linker and not all
  command interpreters may recognise this quirk.
  
  The minimum memory required by the program (offset A) can be ignored by the
  virus, as  the maximum  memory is generally allocated to the program by the
  operating system.   However,  once again,  ignoring this area of the header
  MAY cause  an unsucessful  infection.   Simply adding  the  virus  size  in
  paragraphs to this value can nullify the problem.
  
  The words  representing the  initial stack segment and pointer are reversed
  (not in  little-endian format).   In  other words,  an LES to this location
  will yield  the stack  pointer in  ES and  the  stack  segment  in  another
  register.   The initial  SS:SP is  calculated  with  the  base  address  of
  0000:0000 being at the end of the header.
  
  Similarly, the  initial CS:IP  (in little-endian format) is calculated with
  the base  address of  0000:0000 at  the end of the header.  For example, if
  the program  entry point  appears directly after the header, then the CS:IP
  would be 0000:0000.  When the program is loaded, the PSP+10 is added to the
  segment value (the extra 10 accounts for the 100h bytes of the PSP).
  
  All the  relevant portions  of the  EXE header  have been covered.  So what
  should be  done to  write a  nonoverwriting EXE infector?  First, the virus
  must be appended to the end of the file.  Second, the initial CS:IP must be
  saved and  subsequently changed  in the  header.   Third, the initial SS:SP
  should also  be saved  and changed.   This  is to avoid any possible memory
  conflicts from  the stack  overwriting viral  code.   Fourth, the file size
  area of  the header should be modified to correctly reflect the new size of
  the file.   Fifth,  any additional  safety modifications such as increasing
  the minimum  memory allocation  should be made.  Last, the header should be
  written to the infected file.
  
  There are  several good areas for ID bytes in the EXE header.  The first is
  in the stack pointer field.  Since it should be changed anyway, changing it
  to a  predictable number  would add nothing to the code length.  Make sure,
  however, to  make the stack pointer high enough to prevent code overwrites.
  Another common  area for ID bytes is in the negative checksum field.  Since
  it is  an unused  field, altering  it won't  affect the  execution  of  any
  programs.
  
  One further item should be mentioned before the code for the EXE infector.
  It is important to remember that EXE files are loaded differently than COM
  files.  Although a PSP is still built, the initial CS does NOT point to it.
  Instead, it points to wherever the entry point happens to be.  DS and ES
  point to the PSP, and therefore do NOT point to the entry point (your virus
  code).  It is important to restore DS and ES to their proper values before
  returning control to the EXE.

  This is a simple EXE infector.  It has limitations; for example, it does
  not handle misnamed COM files.  This can be remedied by a simple check:
  
    cmp [bp+buffer],'ZM'
    jnz misnamed_COM
  continueEXE:
  
  Take special notice of the done_infections and infect_exe procedures.  They
  handle all  the relevant portions of the EXE infection.  The restoration of
  the EXE  file simply  consists of  resetting the stack and a far jmp to the
  original entry point.
  
  A final  note on  EXE infections: it is often helpful to "pad" EXE files to
  the nearest  segment.  This accomplishes two things.  First, the initial IP
  is  always  0,  a  fact  which  can  be  used  to  eliminate  delta  offset
  calculations.   Code space  can be  saved by  replacing all  those annoying
  relative memory  addressing statements  ([bp+offset blip])  statements with
  their absolute  counterparts (blip).   Second, recalculation of header info
  can be  handled in  paragraphs, simplifying  it tremendously.  The code for
  this is left as an exercise for the reader.
  
  This file is dedicated to the [XxXX] (Censored. -Ed.) programmers (who have
  yet to figure out how to  write EXE  infectors).  Hopefully, this  text can
  teach them (and everyone else) how to progress beyond simple COM and spawn-
  ing EXE infectors.   In the next issue of 40Hex,  I will present the theory
  and code for the next step of file infector - the coveted SYS file.

                  -=PHALCON/SKISM=- Ear-6 Virus

    The Ear-6 is a parasitic, non-resident, .COM & .EXE infector.  It
infects 5 files everytime it is run.  It will traverse towards the root
directory if fewer than 5 files are found.  We have no clue as to what
the 'AUX error' that Patti talks about.  But then again, Patti isn't
sure as to who she is, let alone an accurate discription on one of our
virii.  On activation (1st of any month), it plays ear quiz with
victim.  Failure to answer the question will result in program
termination.

40Hex Number 8 Volume 2 Issue 4                                       File 010

    Letters to the editor!  Well, as you can imagine when I got this
message I was quite startled.  Sorry Paul, no top billing this time :-).
Although it is at this point, that I would like to say a couple things.
For instance, the virus community seems to think that their actions go
unnoticed.  As you might imagine, this is not quite true.  C'mon,
security people get their hands on 40Hex shortly after our boards get
it.  Just letting you know that big brother is watching :).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------




40-Hex Response:

   As a Security Analyst I find 40-Hex an incredibly interesting magazine.
The magazine presents entirely different viewpoints then what is in the
industry magazines such as Virus Bulletin, Virus News International and 
Virus News and Reviews.   Although all three of these publications are good
and very useful to me in my job, 40-Hex does indeed keep my mind open.  It
discusses viruses in depth, including commented source code, and has been a
real learning tool for me.  There is just not anywhere that you can get the
detailed analysis of a virus except in a magazine like 40-Hex.  I can't help
but be torn between my thirst for knowledge about virii and how they work,
and the fear that the more knowledge about virus writing becomes available to
the public, the greater chance that there is going to be more and more garbage
out there and more and more irresponsible people releasing this garbage on
their "friends and neighbors".

   I do want to thank 40-Hex for what I consider a very favorable review.  I
had to laugh about the comments, because frankly I agreed with them.  I guess
that I do get a little melodramatic sometimes.  But I do honestly believe 
that the knowledge exists out there to create a program/virus that will
be able to escape detection by any method in use today.  Whether it will 
ever be written and whether it will have destructive capabilities I don't 
really know. I don't know of any virus writers that make profits off 
their work.  While all the anti-virus developers, although they complain
about the work that they have to do to keep up with the virus writers, 
certainly make a nice profit on something like a Michelangelo scare.  So 
the only motivation for the virus writer is the challenge of creating a 
nearly undetectable virus.  

   I am very curious myself to see if the NCSA's prediction of 40,000 virii  
by 1994 comes true.  I certainly agree with 40-Hex that most of 
these virii will be hacks of some of the existing code out there now. The 
anti-virus industry itself can't decide on how to count different strains of 
viruses, so anyone will be able to make whatever claim they want anyway.

   Finally, Dr. Solomon said it best informally at the First International 
Virus Prevention Conference.  He was talking about how America was founded
on freedom and the rights of the individual.  He said that Americans seem
far too willing, in his opinion, to voluntarily give up those rights.  Right
now, virus writing is not illegal.  And hopefully it never will be, because
what you or I do with our own personal computers is no one else's business 
but our own.  But when we interfer with someone else's computer or data or
life, that I believe that is where the line is drawn.   Its going to be a 
very long and hard process to determine responsibility for damages caused by
a virus.  Passing a law to make virus writing itself illegal will not solve 
the problem.  Something, though, has to be done to protect an individual's
or a corporation's rights to have a virus-free working environment.  There
are enough problems with buggy commercial software, without having to worry
about virii hitting your computers too.  But until that time comes part of
my job will continue to be warning people about the dangers of viruses and
helping them protect their data.

Response to a Response to a Response:

    As the head of the -=PHALCON/SKISM=-, I find your letter a very
interesting response.  I thank you for your raving reviews on 40Hex.  We
try to make it a magazine that everyone can learn from.  Well, I still
debate the undetectable virus issue.  Regarding the virus writer/anti-virus
issue, I definately agree, that the anti-virus people are motivated by greed
more then anything else.   I am glad to see that you agreed with my oh so
witty comments, they weren't meant to be abusive, just a little comic relief.
    I agree with you on the issues regarding a virus-free working
environment.  But, as you already know,  writing a virus isn't
illegal, it is the spreading that is illegal.  Unfortunately, it is too
late to start working on anti-virus writing legislation now.  The damage
has been done.  The virus issue is fairly similiar to the AIDS issue.
You have to use protection, no matter what.  There will never be an end
to virii.  Even if everyone stopped writing virii, the infection rate
wouldn't decrease.  I  don't know of many people that get hit by the
newer strains that have been coming out.  Most people still get hit by
Jerusalem, Stoned, and other 'classics'.
    I would be very interested in what solutions you may have come up with
to protect the rights of individuals and corporations.  I hadn't heard about
Dr. Solomon's comments, until I recieved your letter.  Quite frankly, I agree
with what he is saying.  Another major problem with making virus writing
illegal is the definition of a virus, or trojan for that matter.  It is
very difficult to come up with a concrete definition.
    I appreciate your response, and definately encourage other people, either
pro- or anti- virus to respond!

I don't want anybody complaining about not being able to compile the PS-MPC
utility in 40Hex-8, so listen close.  You must set the "unsigned chars" option 
on in order for the utility to compile properly.  It is in the Options/Compile 
menu.  Spread the word along with 40Hex...
