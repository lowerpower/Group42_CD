<H1>PC Software Industry Lost $8.08 Billion To Pirates In 1994
</H1>

<H2>Piracy Rate In The US Declines</H2>
<HR>

<P>
<B>February 24, 1995</B> (Washington, DC) -- The Software Publishers Association  
(SPA) is releasing its latest global statistics on software
piracy today to coincide with Vice President Gore's remarks before
the G-7 &quot;Information Society&quot; Conference. The three-day
meeting, which begins today in Brussels, will broadly address
issues surrounding the development of the Global Information Infrastructure
(GII). The SPA report details high double-digit piracy rates in
countries from all regions of the world. The report serves to
underscore the threat large scale intellectual property theft
poses to the development of the GII. Intellectual property rights
are becoming increasingly critical in international trade negotiations
as well, as evidenced in the recent stance taken by the USTR on
intellectual property violations in China.
<P>
The SPA statistics released today summarize 1994 global software
piracy activity. In 1994, the personal computer software industry
lost $8.08 billion due to illegal copying of business application
software alone. The SPA estimates that just under half (49%) of
the business software in use in 1994 was pirated. The estimates
do not include illegal copying of operating systems, education,
entertainment, or personal productivity software.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The good news is that we see a decline of $1.9 billion in
revenue losses from theft of business software from 1993,&quot;
said Ken Wasch, Executive Director of the SPA. &quot;The bad news
is that drop is due entirely to declining prices of business software
in country after country. Therefore, as sales volumes have increased
and prices have declined, the volume of pirated units have nearly
commensurably risen. Overall, the number of units pirated actually
increased 14% in 1994. These figures clearly show that while some
countries have shown improvement there is still a major problem
in international markets.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>China, Russia and Thailand Rates Exceed 90%</H2>

<P>
Of the countries for which the SPA is able to estimate piracy
losses, China has the highest piracy rate at 98%. Russia at 95%
and Thailand at 92% are close behind. All three countries' poor
records of protecting software copyrights led the SPA to cite
them in its 1994 Section 301 filing with the US Trade Representative.
Software industry losses to piracy in these three countries in
1994 were $187 million in China, $144 million in Russia and $55
million in Thailand.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;China, Russia, and Thailand deserve credit for enacting
copyright laws that specifically protect computer programs and
other software,&quot; said Wasch. &quot;But the astronomic levels
of software piracy in these countries illustrate what the SPA
has learned in the US and abroad -- that the law is just the first
step toward legal software use. Another crucial step is education
-- teaching software users why they should not make illegal copies.
We invite the governments and software users in China, Russia,
and Thailand to work with us in sending that message.&quot;

<H2>Japan and US Have Highest Piracy Revenue Losses in the World
</H2>

<P>
Piracy losses to software publishers in Japan were $1.31 billion
in 1994, higher than those seen in any country of the world. While
the loss in Japan was down from $1.66 billion in 1993, this decline
was largely due to price declines. The number of units of software
pirated fell only 6% in Japan between 1993 and 1994.
<P>
Piracy losses in the US fell from $2.08 billion in 1993 to $1.05
billion in 1994 - a nearly 50% decline. In spite of having one
of the lowest piracy rates in the world, losses in the US are
among the highest, however, because of the sheer size of the US
personal computer hardware and software markets.
<H2>Western Europe Follows Trend</H2>

<P>
Piracy losses in Western Europe declined sharply in 1994, falling
to $1.65 billion from $3.65 billion in 1993. Once again, however,
much of the drop was due to the decline in software prices from
1993 to 1994. The rate of software piracy remained at a fairly
high 45% in Western Europe in 1994. Piracy losses in France amounted
to $482 million in 1994, and were the highest of all countries
in Western Europe. While most other Western European countries
saw 10-20%+ declines in their piracy rates between 1993 and 1994,
France's decline from 66% to 62% can only be called disappointing.
<P>
Results in other countries varied widely. Some countries, notably
Switzerland and Finland, had among the lowest piracy rates in
the world in 1994, while others, such as Spain and Portugal, had
piracy rates above 70%. Of all the countries in Western Europe,
the results in Italy in 1994 were the most distressing. Strong
anti-piracy actions by the Italian government in early 1993 led
to a much reduced piracy rate for all of 1993, and created great
expectations for 1994. Unfortunately, these actions did not carry
through into 1994. As a result, piracy in Italy was <I>up</I>in
1994, with the rate increasing from 66% to 68%. Although dollar
losses in Italy fell from $283 million in 1993 to $264 million
in 1994, the decline again was entirely due to price declines.
The number of applications pirated in Italy rose 4% between 1993
and 1994.
<H2>Asian/Pacific Rim Markets Remain Piracy Problems</H2>

<P>
Of the eleven Asia/Pacific Rim markets for which SPA is able to
develop piracy estimates, only two (Australia and New Zealand)
had piracy rates <I>below</I> <I>50%</I> in 1994. The software
industry lost $2.03 billion to pirates in this region in 1994,
as the overall piracy rate was 62%. While this was a 25% decline
from the $2.72 billion loss (75% rate) of 1993, the decline was
again due to the fall of application prices. The number of applications
pirated increased by 1%.
<P>
Even in a region with many problem markets, China still stands
out. Ninety-eight percent of the business applications software
in use in China in 1994 was pirated. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The Chinese government's unwillingness to take necessary
actions to protect intellectual property has prompted the US government
to cite China under Section 301 trade sanctions,&quot; said Mark
Traphagen, Counsel for the SPA. &quot;We fully support the administration's
firm stance against China and hope that it will force the authorities
in China to take steps to remedy their well-documented piracy
and counterfeit problem.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>SPA Adds Home-Use Business Software to Analysis</H2>

<P>
SPA estimates are based on hardware sales figures from International
Data Corporation, and on SPA and other industry software sales
data. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The SPA estimates now consider business applications used
on home-based personal computers,&quot; said SPA Research Director
David Tremblay. &quot;In previous years, our piracy analysis did
not consider the purchase and use of software on home computers.
We could no longer ignore this use. In many markets, home computers
accounted for 30 to 40% of personal computer sales. The addition
of these PCs into the analysis is why our 1993 piracy estimates
were recently revised upward from $7.45 billion to the current
$9.96 billion estimate.&quot;

<H3><A NAME="method">SPA Piracy Loss Estimation Methodology</A>
</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="#top" >Top of Story </A>, <A HREF="#chart" >Chart </A>
<P>
SPA's piracy loss methodology is based on comparing the number
of personal computers sold in a year with the number of applications
sold. Knowing the number of personal computers purchased in a
year, and the average number of applications used on a PC will
give the number of applications being used. Comparing that with
the number of applications purchased will give the number pirated.
<P>
SPA made one change in its methodology this year, extending it
to consider the use of business applications on personal computers
in the home. Within the analysis, separate estimates are made
for the amount of business software used in the home and business
settings. The estimates are then totaled and compared with the
amount of software sold.
<P>
<B>We use four sets of data:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Personal computer hardware sales, by year, and by market (International
Data Corporation)
<LI>Personal computer business software sales, by year, (SPA Data
Program)<BR>
The SPA analysis includes all varieties of business applications
- everything from word processors, spreadsheets, databases and
presentation graphics to e-mail clients, programming languages
and tools, graphics and desktop publishing packages, and utilities
such as screen savers, and anti-virus packages. In all, the SPA
analysis includes sales from 25 types of business applications.
