  CIVCHEAT.EXE is a small standalone utility to modify the save files
  of the Civilisation games. It allows to increase the amount of money,
  the amount of accumulated lightbulbs and to change parameters like
  the year, the human player and the difficulty level.

  The program is command-line driven and requires the name of the 
  save-file and the items the player wants to change. The items to
  change are specified with a character indicating the item and
  a number indicating the value desired for it. If no items to
  modify are specified the program displays the actual values.

  Syntax:

  civcheat <savefile> <option> <option>
  
  Where:
          <savefile> is the name of a Civilisation save file,
                     Ex: civil0.sve
          <option>   is a value to be changed in the format
                     x=yyy where x is a character and yyy is 
                     a number.

  Options available:

          m=xxx      Set the amount of money to xxx
          p=x        Change the human player to be x
          y=xxxx     Set the year to be xxxx, negative numbers
                     indicate years before 0.
          l=x        Change the difficulty level to x
          b=xxx      Change the number of accumulated lightbulbs

  Remarks:

    The program does some checking to make sure you don't enter 
  parameters who don't make sense. For example the amount of money
  is limited to 32000. However, my parsing of the commandline is
  _very_ simple minded and will fall over if you specify the
  parameters slightly different, like inserting a space between
  the '=' and the number.
    The program came into existence between yesterday Midnight and
  five in the morning. It worked for me, but there are certainly
  bugs left. Indicate them to me, I might fix them :-).
    There are numerous of other useful things I might be able to
  integrate into follow-on versions. If you have a good idea send
  me a note. I've got some ideas myself, how would you like all your
  units to become veterans ? Or increase the movement points of
  your units to 30 moves ? 

    I would like to thank Tom Kimball (tom@europa.lonestart.org) and
  Charles K Huges (Charles_K_Hughes@cup.portal.com) for their postings
  about the internals of the civ save file. I would not have made this
  program without their information.

  Have Fun !
