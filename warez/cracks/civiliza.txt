Crack> Civilization 
 
crack written by the Mooncrow 
 
This is a quick and simple unprotect for Microprose's CIVILIZATION game. 
The unprotect will remove that annoying request at 3000BC for information 
regarding the requirement to achieve some randomly selected technology. 
 
FILE: CIV.EXE (mine is date stamped 12/03/91) 
 
Look for the following hex byte sequence: 7D 05 CD 
It should start at hex offset 276D. 
 
Change the "7D" to "EB" and save the modified file. 
 
This patch changes the JGE instruction to a JMP and makes the program assume 
that you have already answered the "protection" question. 
 
One additional benefit from this unprotect is that you can use the SAVE GAME 
feature as soon as you have completed the first move in the game.
