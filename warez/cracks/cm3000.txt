	ALL THE CRACKS YOU NEED FOR THE CHESSMASTER3000!.. :)

  Simply copy all the files from the original disks (i.e. DOS COPY).

	INSTALL.COM -- execute this instead of INSTALL.EXE from the original
 diskette.
	CM.COM -- once installed and "configuration changed" (copy-
 protection violated) run this to play the game.
	CM3.COM -- the same as CM.COM, but it also displays the title screen.
	CM3_TSR.COM -- load it in memory, it's a substitute for all the files
 above. It cracks the install program and the game (v1.02a & v1.03).
 Can be unloded, just run it second time.

	If you like to mess with executables here are the patches:

FILE: CM.EXE
Works for both v1.02a and v1.03.
ORIGINAL: 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 BE FF 78
CRACK   : == == == == 01 == == == == == == == ==
Note: There seems to be a bug in Norton Disk Editor 6.01, so if you use it,
search for the bytes several times, using different pieces
of the search string.

FILE: INSTALL.EXE in v1.03 (which is PKLITEd, but not even extra):
NOTE: use PKLITE -x INSTALL.EXE
ORIGINAL: E8 07 F2 EB 0E
CRACK   : == == == == 1E
