Unprotect Cobra Mission


Search the file cm.exe for the following seven byte hex string:

                      C8 62 00 00 83 3E C8

And change them to:

                      FF 06 86 5D 33 C0 C3

Use PCTOOLS or NORTONS to search and replace the bytes.

How it works. 
=============
 this patch replaces "read integer/cardinal number" (password) by own procedure
 This own procedure does not read string and then convert to number but simlpy
 increments number by 1 and returns read O.K. result.
	inc word ptr [5D86]	; 5D86  => location of number result
	xor ax, ax		; ax=0  => success in reading
        ret			; thats all

Because of used unprotect algorithm, password searching process takes a few 
seconds and it is random time (on 386sx 25MHz mean time is ca. 15 sec.) but
it is still shorter then looking in documentation and entering number.
