
			    Cracker version 1.0

	As you can understand, Cracker is a  utility to crack games and other
software. To crack something,  it needs a crack file for that  game. When you
start Cracker, it first scans all crack  files in the Cracker directory (i.e.
the directory where CRACKER.EXE is located). On  the screen appears a list of
all cracks it found.  When you select a game to crack,  on the screen appears
something like this:

Use up/down arrow keys to select a crack  and left/right arrow keys to select
whether you want  to crack the game,  undo crack so that everything  would be
exactly like originally, or set the directory  path for the game. The default
game path  is current  DOS path.  When you  select "Crack" or "Undo", on  the
screen appears a window showing the cracking progress. If you wanted to crack
a game  that is already  cracked or uncrack  a game  that is not  cracked, an
error message  is displayed.  If everything is  OK, the "Done!"  messages are
displayed for each  file cracked and you  can select "Cancel" to get  back to
the game selection menu. To exit Cracker, press ESC.
NOTE:If the file is  compressed (for example, with LZEXE),  then Cracker does
not recognize the game and an error message is displayed.

			   Getting crack files

	There   is  nothing   simpler   than   calling   The  Dark   Corner  BBS,
+7-0142-492280.  It  is open 6pm-8am (UTC+2+daylight savings). And of course,
if  you crack  something by yourself or get some cracks,  please upload it to
The Dark Corner BBS!

			    Crack file format

	A crack file is  an ordinary text file with  the file extension .CRK.
It's first  line contains  the name  of the  game. This  line appears in  the
Cracker's "Select  game" window  and  must therefore  be  not longer  than 42
characters. The second  line is a blank  line. The rest of the  file contains
cracking instructions.  If the  crack file  contains more  than one  cracking
instruction, they  must be separated  by blank lines.  There must not  be any
blank lines in one cracking instruction.
	The first line of  the cracking instruction contains the  name of the
crack, for example, "Remove password check" or "Unlimited lives". It must not
be longer than 54 characters. The next lines contain  the name of the file to
be changed, then file offsets and byte values at this offset before and after
cracking. Then  follows the  same for other  files. Here  is a  typical crack
file:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Super Hyper Mario Bros

Remove Password Check
GAME1.EXE
00024C1F: 75 90
00024C20: 0F 90
GAME2.EXE
00022466: 75 90
00022467: 0F 90

Unlimited Lives
GAME1.EXE
00004068: 8B B8
00004069: 84 00
0000406A: 72 00
0000406B: F3 90
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This crack  file is just an example  and, as we know, there  is no game
named like that.
