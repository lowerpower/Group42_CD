QUESTIONS:
1) What do I do with the godlike.plr file once I unzip it?
A: FIRST:Copy it into your descent directory
   SECOND: You will probably want to rename it to your name instead of
           godlike, this is fine ... just make sure the extension is still
           .plr !!!
   THIRD: Start descent and select the newly renamed player file and then
          the level at which to start.
   FOURTH: You will probably need to customize the new .plr file to your
          needs.

          Then you're ready!!!!

2) Who made this? How did you do it?
A: I did it. With a Hex editor.

3) Will this crash my system?
A: I doubt it, it wouldn't crash on mine. The level 11 lasers would slow it
   down a bit, but not crash.

4) Why are the numbers messed up looking?
A: The game presets aren't meant to go up to 4, 5, and 6 digit numbers ... 
   except for the score. So it will look strange, but that's the price
   you pay for having a destructive, multi-purpose ship.

5) My computer just fragmented into a thousand pieces when a used the
   saved game of yours!!!!...blah...blah...blah....
DISCLAIMER: I do not claim that this saved game is perfect, it has its 
   flaws, but there is no way in hell it will damage anything ... all 
   it does is let you have a little more fun.

   The worst case scenario is that someone renamed the godlike.plr file to
   myname.plr, then they copied it to their descent directory and ...
   Whoops, there was already an myname.plr file in that directory. So
   please remember to rename it to something that isn't already there.

Please let me know if you have questions or comments about this file!
