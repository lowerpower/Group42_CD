Debug-keys for Doom, Wolf3d and Spear of Destiny . . .

I have uploaded this text file out of anger. I bought all three
of the above games, and I have registered for it. It says in the
manual which came together with the games, that I will be given the
secret-codes once I have registered. The thing is that I have not been
given the codes after I have registered. I finally got all these codes
from my brother who lives in asia. I think a lots of other people may
have been treated the same way, so I decided that I should upload this
file to everyone with any of these games.

Debug-keys for DOOM.

While already playing the game, type the following commands to activate
different functions . . .

iddqd			God mode (degreelessness mode) never will get hurt.
idkfa			Full ammo, full armour, with all three keys.
idclev			After typing this command you must next type the
			episode number and the level number that you want
			to be transported to.
idbehold		After typing in this command, you must then type
			in the mode that you want. i.e. several modes will
			be displayed on top of the screen, choose by
			typing the first character of the word.
idmypos			Tells you your position (not much use).
idchoppers		Don't really know what it does!
idspispopd		Walk through walls and doors.
iddt			Type this command when you are viewing the map
			(by pressing TAB) to view the entire map. If type
			this command twice, objects of treasure and enermy
			will appear on the map.

To dis-activate the function, just type the command another time.

Debug-keys for Wolf3d and Spear of Destiny.

At DOS prompt, instead of typing wolf3d to start the game, type
wolf3d -goobers to start the game. For spear of Destiny, instead of typing
spear, type spear -debugmode to start the game.

While playing the game, press <left shift> <alt> <backspace> together to
activate the debug-mode.
After activating the debug-mode, type the following commands to activate
different functions . . .

<tab> q			quit the game.
<tab> w			Warp to another level.
<tab> e			go to next level.
<tab> t			debug information in memory.
<tab> i			free items, full ammo, free score.
<tab> m			memory map.
<tab> n			walk through walls.
<tab> b			change border color (what for ?).
<tab> x			extra stuff.
<tab> h			hurt yourself (are you crazy ?).
<tab> o			map of level.
<tab> s			slow motion.
<tab> f			position information.
<tab> g			god mode, never will get hurt !

I have tested all these keys in the original version of these games, I
don't know about the shareware versions. So they might not work if the
version is different. These commands here should be helpful and . . .
isn't it cool to play this game without getting hurt ? Well, enjoy
yourself. I also have some more commands which I have not included in as
I am too lazy to. If you are interested in the extra commands, write to me.
I will be more then happy to exchange mine with whatever interesting stuff
you have.
