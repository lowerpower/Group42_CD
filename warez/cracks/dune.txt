                                    crack

I'm back a day later with yet another quality crack (yes, I know
this game is old). Wow, I'm really getting the hang of Soft-ICE. If 
you want to get into this as well, I highly recommend you get a copy 
(a legal one!) of this great debugger.

                           
        Well, this program wasn't quite as difficult as Vengeance of 
Excalibur, the crack for which I released yesterday. Dune didn't even 
have self-modifying code. What made it a pain, though, was that after
getting your response to the doc check, the program filed it away for
a long time (a few seconds is an eternity if you're sitting there 
single-stepping through the assembly code), and then after bringing 
up the main program screen complete with mouse pointer, it decides to
go check to see if your response is correct. After getting bored with
searching for the compare routine, I read about breakpoints (some-
thing I never bothered with before) and found a handy S-ICE command 
to stop the program when it accesses a particular memory address 
(the place where it stores your response!). After that, it was simple.
Wish I had known about that earlier.
        I'm sure you're tired of this explanation, so here's the crack.
 
Search DUNEPRG.EXE for:     74 0F C7
          replace with:     75
 
That's all there is to it! Coming soon: a crack for "Reach for the
Skies." The group I got this from failed to crack it properly.
