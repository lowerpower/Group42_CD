Crack for DUNE ][ (original AND patched version).

This is a crack for DUNE ][, a game with just AWESOME sound.

Anyway, they let you play the game for a while, and then jump you
with the password action. I played the game under Turbo Debugger 386
for a while. When it came to the password, I broke out and traced the code
to a JUMP_IF_EQUAL routine.

Change the JUMP_IF_EQUAL instruction to a JUMP_ALWAYS instruction, and life
was good.
