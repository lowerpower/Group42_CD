Here are all 2 dozen codes for Dungeon Hack, I used the
other file (dungeonhackcodes.txt) for a starting point; it
only had half of them.  This is ordered with the word after
the page number, as this is all you need (ok, there are two
on page 9, but they've got different 1st letters, which the
game prompts you with).
