OK, I finally hacked it. Here's what to do: 
Search for: 
BE 0F BF BF 2B 30 E8 E3 FE E8 BD FE 
Replace the first two by: C3 00 
Search for: 
2E 89 6F C8 E8 B1 24 E9 34 1C 
Replace the first four with NOPs (90) 
This takes care of the check if the word is correct. 

To actually remove the question, 
Search for: 
E8 FF 19 BF D9 06 81 C7 C4 06 B0 18 BB 5A 00 
BA 0A 00 B9 93 00 FF D7 
Replace the first three and the last two with NOPs (90).
