Crack> Eye of the Beholder II

This is a nice 1-byte crack for Eye of the Beholder 2. 

The boys from SSI tried to be tricky, (maybe unknowingly) 
but I got through their BS anyway. 

They had some funky way of reading the key-board. I'm still 
not sure how they did it, but Hey... WHO CARES!!!! 
Besides that, putting the protection way INTO the game makes 
things harder sometimes.... (not this time :-)) 

Basically, what this crack does is the follwoing...... 

The program does the following: 

1   Get input 
2   Encode / decode etc. etc. etc. 
3   Was it the right one? 
      If so JUMP and continue the program 
      If not, return to protection routine. 

My patch changes the "If so JUMP" line to "JUMP ALWAYS" 

So the patch: 
   Scan for:   83 C4 08 0B C0 74 14 47 
                              ^-------------Change to EB 

Thats it..... 
   Have fun.
