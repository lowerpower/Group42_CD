     Here's how to get rid of that silly code wheel.
After this you don't have to tune the radio any-
more.
     You will need Norton Utilities or Debug,
Norton is easier.  When using Norton Utilities,
select BOB.EXE and search for 36 24 75 08 B8
01 (using the hex field) and change the 75 08 to
90 90.  Write the data and you're done.
     If you are using Debug:
REN BOB.EXE BOB.XXX
DEBUG BOB.XXX
R                   use the value of CS for the next step
S CS:0000 FFFF 39 87 36 24 75 08 B8 01 00 8B E5
                    replace CS with the value

(Debug should respond with something like
this:
CS:xxxx xxxx     is used next)

U xxxx     use the value from above in place of xxxx

     (You should see:
CS:xxxx     CMP [BX+2436],AX
CS:yyyy     JNZ 7762)

E yyyy     use value from above
75.90 08.90       you type the 90s
W
Q
REN BOB.XXX BOB.EXE
     Now run it and have fun.
