                                    crack

        Here's a crack for the game 'Fireteam 2200' which removes the doc 
check at the beginning:
        After installing the game from floppies, use a hex editor to scan
STARTUP.EXE for the string 
                            C0 74 1B  
        and change it to:      75

        Just type a bogus number at the doc check and it'll let you in.
        Look for more great cracks from me in the future, including one
for the latest Hyperdisk which removes all the annoying shareware regis-
tration 'nag' screens at boot-up.
