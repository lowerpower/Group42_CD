Unprotect for The Perfect General, by QQP.

Crack by RAD

Use Norton Utilities/PCTools or a hex editor for this crack. If you cannot
find the string STOP NOW, you have a different version than the one I used 
for this crack.

File: GENERAL.EXE

Search for:    8D 11 75 0E 9A 14 0A 05 20
                     ^^ ^^
Replace with:        EB 09

It's that simple, now when the menu is accessed there will be no more
annoying "Top Secret" verification screen.
