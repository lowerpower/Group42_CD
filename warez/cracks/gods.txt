   Well here it is, for all you people who are frustrated with the game
GODS - Into The Wonderful, a small cheat to give you ever lasting shield.
(IBM-PC Version)

   In the file GAME.EXE change the byte at offset 75F0 to CC.
   Alternatively, in the same file, search for 0D C2 71 90 77 BC E6 76 AE
   and change 77 to CC.  All numbers are in hex of course.

   Once you start the game, either die deliberately, or play until you get
a shield. This shield will last indefinitely.
