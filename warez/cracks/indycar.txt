* * * INFO:

        Here's a list of some IndyCar cheats/cracks I have found.
You should go ahead and get the update, ICR104.ZIP. You will need this
version if you choose to use the crack. The cheats should work with
any previous version as well, however. Please read the readme.txt files
included in the zip files. For the .txt files, you will need
a HEX EDITOR to change the program yourself. 
        There are also 2 cheats for Indianapolis 500 Game.
These are NOT for IndyCar racing. They are listed at the end of this file.
Please note, all files for IndyCar racing begin with ICR*.*, while those
for the old Indy 500 game begin with INDY*.*
        If you come across any new cheats, additions, great instant
replays, etc, please let me know. We are always interested in sharing
good car setups, stories, and new enhancements to IndyCar Racing. Simply
send me some e-mail.
         This file will be updated as new information becomes available.
Feel free to send me any suggestions or comments.
        Also, most of these files were created by someone else. I have
made every effort to have them named. All I have done is combined them
and placed them on various FTP sites for easier access to us all. But,
remember, the work was done by others, so feel free to drop them your
comments as well. After all, they provided us with these programs.
