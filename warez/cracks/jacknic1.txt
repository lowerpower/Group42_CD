                          Code cracked by: MAINTENANCE

  To unprotect the game Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes Of Major Championship
Golf, simply copy the files GOLFC.EXE, GOLFE.EXE, and GOLFT.EXE to a separate
disk or sub-directory. DO NOT use your originals!

  Next, making use of your favorite Hex-Editor, search each of the three files
listed above for the Hex string of 3D 03 00 75 03 E9 84 01 E8. This string only
occurs once in each of the files. If you can't locate this string, STOP NOW!...
you have a different version and this patch won't work!

  Once the above mentioned string is found, change it to read EXACTLY as the
following: 3D 03 00 75 03 90 90 90 E8. You now have an unprotected version of
this game that you do not have to identify any course holes with! ENJOY!

P.S.- GOLFM.EXE does not need this patch because it loads the file GOLFC.EXE
into your system for monochrome displays.

Since I'm using a VGA system I'll talk about the file GOLFE.EXE
in this unprotect.  The following will work in GOLFC.EXE also,
and probably in the other two .EXE files as well.

If you have a track editor such as Norton Utility, search
GOLFE.EXE for:

F4 02 74 03 E9 ED

and replace with:

F4 02 EB 03 E9 ED

If you are looking for code in GOLFC.EXE then look just for the
first occurrence of F4 02 74 03 and replace with F4 02 EB 03.

You can now input any number between 1 and 54 for the graphic
display asking which course is displayed on your screen.

Have Fun!
