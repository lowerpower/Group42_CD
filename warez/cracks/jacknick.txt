Crack> Jack Nicklaus Golf
crack written by anonymous

This program is protected by a code-wheel lookup, and is hideously easy
to defeat.  This patch will work for the following version of the game:

	GOLF     EXE     82503 09-19-90   9:52a

The file is compressed with LZEXE v0.90, and its uncompressed size is
146164 bytes.

So, to crack it, uncompress it with UNLZEXE, and change offset 3BDC:
E8 56 F5 to 90 90 90.  This will completely bypass the code-wheel prompt
and verification.

Addendum
--------
To crack the course designer, UNLZEXE the file DESIGN.EXE (size 76307,
date 09-19-90), and edit offset 2C47: 9A 34 -> EB 03.
