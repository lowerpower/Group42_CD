 
Lakers versus Celtics Unprotect

   Isn't it annoying when you buy a new game, or when you pirate
   a new game and they ask you for information that is concealed in
   the game's package, then you have to find a friend that has the
   game and copy the information down, well here I have the solution
   for Lakers vs. Celtics. The "All-Time Playoff Records".

              But the price is rather lame 
