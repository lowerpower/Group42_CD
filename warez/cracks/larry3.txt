             LEISURE SUIT LARRY III UNPROTECT

By Dr. Eddie Currie, Ph.D.

My arch nemesis, Sierra, has scraped the bottom of the unprotect barrel
in Liesure Suit Larry III.  Since this package is replete with naked 
female breasts and graphic depictions of missionary coitus, I deemed
that it would be sufficiently offensive to grating feminists that I 
should reduce my customary $10.00 registration fee to a mere $5.00. This
fee is traditionally requested to defray the cost of my research.

Let me take this opportunity to thank the many of you who have become
registered users of my unprotect schemes. 

Your choice is as follows;  $50.00 to Sierra, $5.00 to me (although
I will certainly not discourage larger donations), or nothing.  As I
often point out, this last choice would be dishonest, so please refrain
from that line of thought.

You might prefer to think of your donation as a registration fee which
will entitle you to full use of my 24 hour, 7 day a week technical
hotline, and which will further entitle you to access the "Jolly-Roger"
fax machine.

Please send donations/registration fees to;

	Dr. Eddie Currie
	Dept. LSL3
	6-157 158th Street
	Beechhurst, New York  11357

	Technical hotline:	718-746-9069
	Jolly Roger Fax:	718-767-6620

If you've sent in your donation, you have become a registered pirate, 
and you may call collect.  If the first mate answers ask to speak with 
Grandmaster Zorton, my pirate handle (wink). Best of luck to ya, matie.

Rather than describe the way Sierra's money-grubbing little programmers
have protected their game, I have elected to merely tell you that any
of the information which follows may become relevent to successful 
completion.

The references to the manual are varied and random, but rest assured
that due to my diligence, you will be able to play the game to its
conclusion.

The manual which you would normally have in your hot little hand
if you had given Sierra $50.00 of your hard earned money (not a wise
choice in my opinion) resembles the tourist brochures which abound
in the lobbies of island hotels.  In this case, the island is "Nontoonyt"
and that is where we join our hero, Leisure Suit Larry, as he tries
to bury his meatpipe.  Apparently, Larry has never heard of AIDS or
herpes, for he uses the women of Nontoonyt like Kleenex.  He blows his
nose (only it's not his nose), and discards them.  If I were a feminist,
or even sympathetic to any of the principles of feminism, I would be
outraged.  Fortunately, neither of these is the case.  Incidently,
I don't expect to entertain any telephone calls from disgruntled 
women's-lubers. In theory, you'll all be too busy boycotting pornography
and burning your underwear to bother me.
