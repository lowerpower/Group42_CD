--- How to Crack the Protection on "Lemmings"


After installing the game on your hard drive, run the file LEMMINGS.BAT.
Follow the on-screen instructions about computer type.

When the game tries to run, if you do not have the original disk in drive
A or B, the game will crash. That's okay. If you *do* have the original
disk in A or B, it will go the Title Screen Menu from which you should
exit to DOS.

Either way, the program will create a hidden file named RUSSELL.DAT.
First, use a Hex Editor like Norton Utilities to edit the file. Change the
very first char at the very beginning of the file to 00 and save it.

Next, by whatever method you prefer, change the attributes of that file to
HIDDEN, ARCHIVE, and READ-ONLY.

From now on, the game will still check for the original disk but will always
go on to the Title Screen regardless. You may want to make sure that a disk
of some kind is in drive A or B to prevent damage from head knock.

Have Fun! :)
