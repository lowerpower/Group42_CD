Hey, Scot, don't worry. My manual was stolen by aliens, so I was
having problems getting past the wall too. But, thanks to Steve,
the guy at WaldenSoftware, I was able to peek at the manual and
get the solve for you.

The answer to the first problem is RISE. Now here you have to
be careful, because the R is in IGNORANCE, the I in KILLS, the
S in WISDOM, and the E in ELEVATES.

The second problem was much harder, as it involves symbols which
the translation for them was in my manual (that got nabbed by
aliens). But, again, thanks to the guy at WaldenSoftware, I
now have the ones you need to get past the problem. The answer is
SOAR, the translation for it will be sent in another post as
KQ6: Logic Cliffs, in gif format.

Puzzle three presents you with four blank circles, and the
combination you need to press is Fourth, First, and then Second.

Puzzle four again uses the symbols in the (long gone) manual.
The answer is AZURE, CATERPILLAR, TRANQUILITY, and AIR.
The stones you need to press will also be in the gif file,
marked with X's in the bottom right-hand corners.

The fifth (and last) puzzle was pretty simple, the answer is
ASCEND, and as in the first puzzle, is first letter, first word.
