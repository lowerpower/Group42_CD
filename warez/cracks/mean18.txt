Crack> Mean 18: Accolade

crack written by Briggs

     Caution: Do not modify your original disk.
     Copy all your files to another disk or to a subdirectory on your
hard disk and put the original disk away in a safe place.
     Mean 18 does not indicate a version number but the file size for
GOLF.EXE should be 89375 bytes.  The copy protection scheme
looks for a bad sector on drive A.  We will patch 4 calls to this
routine with NOP's (no operation) and patch 1 JUMP to an early
exit with a NOP.
     Put DEBUG.COM (from your DOS disk) in the same directory
or make sure it is in the DOS path.  Type the following commands:

REN GOLF.EXE GOLF.XXX         Rename program for debug
DEBUG GOLF.XXX              Start debug
RCS                     Check contents of cs register
     Retype the 4 digits shown, but add 1 to the left digit first.  The
code that we want to change is beyond the current 64K segment.

E CS:4FE3 90 90 90  NOP the first call
E CS:4FEC 90 90 90  NOP the second call
E CS:500A 90 90 90  NOP the third call
E CS:5019 90 90 90  NOP the fourth call
E CS:5058 90 90     NOP the early exit jump
RCS                 Check cs register again

     Retype the 4 digits shown, but subtract 1 from the left digit first.
Restore the cs register to its original state.
W                       Write file back to the disk
Q                       Quit debug
REN GOLF.XXX GOLF.EXE   Restore file name

     Now run GOLF and confirm that the patch works.

>>>Note from Bob:  If this doesn't work, there are two more cracks I
>>>have on file for Mean 18.
