/*
Doc Check Crack for NCAA Basketball: Road to the Final Four 2
 
Using a disk editor such as Norton Disk Doctor, on file
NCAA2.HST (file size 221 bytes) at offset D2 (hex) from
start of file, write the following sequence of hex bytes:
2C 28 67 09
 
This will remove the doc check from the game that comes up
the first time it is run after installation.
 
The following is a Turbo C program that does the above. It
must be run in the same directory as the game.
