Crack> Paladin by Omnitrends

crack written by Jim Bello

     This patch will remove the jump to the docu-
mentation check in Paladin.

     Use PCTools or Norton Utilities to search for 3B 46 FC
75 0B and change the 75 0B to 90 90.

     The Documentation check window will still
appear, but just hit 'enter' and the program will
run.

>>>Note from Bob:  What *is* this game?
