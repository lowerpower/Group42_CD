     Requirements:
PC-Tools or Norton Utilities
     I was getting really annoyed at the copy
protection with this game, so I got out my sector
editor and started poking around.  Eventually I
found the answer.
     First install the program normally by unarcing
it onto your hard drive or 7 floppies.

     *Note:* I had absolutely no luck unarcing it onto
floppies.  It took me an hour and didn't even run!
(But, it did install to the hard drive O.K.)  Part of
the install is configuring the program for your
system.

     Once you have the program installed:

1. Find the file named START.EXE and rename
it to something else like STARTBAK.EXE.

2. Copy the file STARTBAK.EXE to
START.EXE.  This renames the original and
makes the copy the executable program.

3. Using PC-Tools VIEW-EDIT mode or Norton
Utilities Hex Editor, call up the file
START.EXE.

4. Find the 13 following words with the Hex-
Editor and change each one to HAHAHA (or
any 6 Capital letters - not lowercase!) and save
the changes to disk in the file START.EXE:

>>>Note from Bob: It's easier to change all the
>>>words you find to Hex 00.  Then, just press
>>>'enter' when asked for the code check.
>>>However, his way works as well.

BEWARE, ZOMBIE, NOTNOW, COPPER, DRAGON, EFREET,
FRIEND, JUNGLE, KNIGHT, SAVIOR, TEMPLE, VULCAN,
WYVERN

5. When you enter the program and are asked for
the code from the Translation Wheel, type
HAHAHA and you're in!

     That's all there is to it.  It is understood, of
course, that this unprotect is only to be used by
legitimate owners of the game - who have tired o
spinning that &%@# code wheel!
