Just in case it hasn't been posted, there is a built-in cheat in Prince of
Persia 2.  Just start the game like so:

PRINCE2 MAKINIT

Then have fun trying all the SHIFT combinations.  A couple to get you started:

SHIFT-+ More time
SHIFT-I Invert screen
SHIFT-N Advance level (endlessly)
SHIFT-T Add potion
