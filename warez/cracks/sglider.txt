                       Unprotect for Star Glider


 BE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR DISK BEFORE STARTING AND USE THE
 BACK UP FOR THE UNPROTECT.
 Modify only the backup copy!!!

 First you should rename the file or files
 MAIN.EXE TO MAIN


 Ex. C>rename main.exe main

 Next Load program into debug...

 Ex. C>debug main

 Then Follow the sample debug session:

     -s 0000 ffff 75 06 c6 06 23    :   Search of protection pattern

     XXXX:YYYY                      :   The search will return one addresses.
                                        If more or less than one are returned
                                        this unprotect may not work.

     -e YYYY 90 90                  :   Edit the contents of the computed
                                        address

 Now write the new main game back to the disk:

     -w  <Enter>

     Writing XXXX bytes

 Then Quit Debug:

     -q  <Enter>

 Now it is time to rename main back to main.exe

     C>ren main main.exe

 Now try to run the new (Hopefully) unprotected version of Star Glider
 just push CR when asked question.

     C>main

 Now the debugging tool used by "Super Dave" is available to you.
 The software that enabled the the breaking of this program and others like,

 Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade - De-protected in 3hrs using D86
 Police Quest II                  - De-protected in 2hrs using DOS's Debug
 Leasure Suit Larry III           - De-protected in 1hr using DOS's Debug
 Colonel's BeQuest                - De-protected in .5hr using DOS's Debug
 Monday Night Football            - De-protected in .5hr using DOS's Debug
 Sargon IV                        - De-protected in .5hr using D86

 just to name a few.

    All you need is a PC-AT compatible, the HOT_BRK software and your
 favorite debugger. With it you can break into your debugger at anytime,
 just as if you had a hardware debugging tool (even if the program re-vectors
 the video, keyboard & break point vectors.
    No more single stepping through the program trying to find the point when
 if asks for the protection, just run the program normally and when the
 protection is encountered break into your debugger and single step through it.
    This tool is also great for debugging your own software. When the software
 locks up break into the debugger to find out why, stop at any point to
 examine memory or change values on the fly.
    And as if all this weren't enough the registered version of AT-SLOW is
 built in. Now you can slow down those games that run to fast on your
 286/386/486 machine. Drop back to DOS in those programs that normally lockup
 your computer and require a re-boot.

 All this is available to you for only $40 including shipping. Just send a
 check or money order to:

 Summit Computers. We take MC/Visa/AMEX and Discover.

 or leave me mail on my BBS listed below.

 Note:
    This software is only a tool. If you have never de-protected software and
 don't know assembler or how to use a dynamic debugger this software will not
 on its own enable you to de-protect software.
    If however you have de-protected software and/or have assembler experience
 this software will enable you to debug and de-protect software that you never
 thought possible faster and easer than you thought possible. Let the list
 of broken software above prove its worth.
