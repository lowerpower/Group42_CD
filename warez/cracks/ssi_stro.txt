This is a crack for SSI game STRONGHOLD. It was done and tested in 2 hours,
so there could be some mistake in my crack. For sure I enclose words you need
to type in (althought I don't know on which pages or line are they).

So you have to find this sequence:
8C C4 08 0B C0 75 10 FF 76 F8

And replace it with this one:
8C C4 08 31 C0 31 DB FF 76 F8


8CC408	add sp,8		8CC408  add sp,8
0BC0	or ax,ax		31C0    xor ax,ax
7510	jnz 3115		31DB    xor bx,bx
FF76F8	push [bp-8]     	FF76F8	push [bp-8]

I could recommend you DiskEdit (or DE from Norton Utilities) or PcTools.
If you don't know what means 8C C4 08, don't do it!

Words you need:
choose					movement
button					gold
plan					hit
squares					swamps
would					repair
controlling				setting
sage					when
home					needed
screen					spellcasting
opponents				expense
after (2,2)				dots (4,3)
longbow					spells
constructing
