Listed below please find all 160 TIM passwords. That's right, 160.
This list includes the passwords for the puzzles in the new TIM
add-on disk.

The first entry is blank - you don't need a password for the first
puzzle of the game. Entry of any password on this list gives you 
access to all the puzzles below that level. For some reason, there
are *2* final passwords. Entry of either of these passwords gives
you access to all levels of the game.

The game turns the list of puzzles that you've `done' (or entered
the password for) green. If you enter the final password, all the
puzzles in the list turn green. So, if you do this, you must keep
careful track of the levels that you've completed, or you might 
miss some.

If you get fed up with this, you can turn all the levels back to 
red by deleting the file `TIM.CFG'. This file is updated each time 
you quit the game, saving the level that you've got to. If you 
delete this file, it's regenerated the next time you quit the game.
When I deleted it from my TIM + Add-on-disk setup, the add-on levels
turned red and the original levels stayed green.

*** CAUTION *** make a backup copy of your game before trying this.
If you delete files from the game, and the whole thing refuses to 
run, *and* you haven't first made a backup; don't come crying to 
me :-)

These passwords work fine on the UK version of the game. For all
I know, they'll work on all versions of the game worldwide, and
also cover the new commercial version that will be released soon;
which combines original TIM and the add-on disk stuff. However,
I'm not making any guarantees.

Congratulations to Jeff Tunnell Productions and Sierra on a game
that has held my attention right to the end. I've played many, 
many computer games; and I tire of most before I complete them.
Nice work, guys!

Please feel free to distribute this file. However, please leave
the whole text intact - the spoiler alert, the warnings, and my 
.sig at the end. (Fame - I wanna live forever :-) )

Here's the list of passwords: enjoy the game!
