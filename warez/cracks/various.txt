There are several different cheats for this one.

On the high score screen, type 'DEBBIE S' for unlimited lives.

When you die, wait until the title screen appears. Press CAPS LOCK, then
type 'DALEY-88'.  You will then continue on the same level you died on.

On the title page, type 'ROBOCOPPETER' for continuous mode.

When you die, wait until the title screen appears. Press CAPS LOCK, then
type 'MAGENTA'.  Now when playing, hit 'S' to skip levels.

Or for unlimited lives the 'edit' way:

        You don't have enough C-Bills?  Well, this will help.
Save your game and use PCTools, with the GAME# (# = number
of the save game) ready.  Edit the bytes at offset 05D5(hex)
and 05D6(hex).  Replace them with 0070.  That should give
you about 28762 C-Bills when you return to the game.  You
may go as high as FF7F, which will total 32767, but I
wouldn't want to go higher than that, or there could be a
program interpretation messup.

BRUCE LEE

Status: Untested
Source: The Mad Hacker

        (This is for the disk version only.)  First, Bruce Lee is an
excellent product.  It's just that (aaarrrggghhh) you have no "falls"
left, and you feel yourself quite near the finish of the game.
Suddenly, one of those little dots floating on the floor taps your
foot and you get zapped.  You see the sign "Game Over" and you
feel pretty pissed, and wish tou could open the drive and rip the
disk to shreds - but wouldn't that be a waste?

        One thing you could do is play option C, one player vs. your
opponent played by the other player.  But this time, play alone, and
make sure the second joystick is calibrated wrong.  If the computer
sees that the Green Yamo isn't moving, it will take over, so a
wrong calibration will make it move all of the time.  So, you're
playing, but that stupid ninja is in your way and it won't let you
win.

        So, fix it!  Eliminate him.  And this is how you do it.  Get a disk
utility, preferrably Norton Utilities.  Zap the Bruce Lee disk.  Make
the following changes to a backup copy.

   Sector   Offset From         To
   271      139         09   63
            354         09      63

>>>Note from Bob:  These are probably decimal values.  Assuming they are,
>>>you'll probably want to use this table:
>>>Sector       Offset   From   To
>>>10F          8B       09     3F
>>>             162      09     3F
>>>......of course, I could be wrong.

        That's all there is to it.  Now you play, the Green Yamo flying
around crazily, and the ninja... hmm... the ninja seems to appear
for a quick second then disappear.  That's what's supposed to
happen and there's your fix.  Bye!

CASTLE WOLFENSTINE 3d Episode 1
-------------------------------
Status: Tested
Source: Ben Rudiak-Gould

(v1.0 means Wolf3D version 1.0 and v1.1 means Wolf3D version 1.1)

To enter the mode, do the following:

1.  Invoke Wolfenstein 3-D with the "next" parameter (wolf3d -next)
    for v1.0, or the "goobers" parameter for v1.1.  You can also use
    whatever other command-line parameters you want.

2.  Begin or restore a game.  While in the game, hold down the TAB,
    CONTROL, and ENTER keys simultaneously for v1.0, or the LEFT SHIFT,
    ALT, and BACKSPACE keys for v1.1.  You should get a message stating
    that debugging keys are now available.

That's it!

To use debugging mode commands, hold down the TAB key and one of the
letter keys listed below simultaneously:

B   Changes the screen border color.  Don't ask me why it's here, but
    it's here.

C   Displays the number of statics, doors, and actors in the level.  I
    believe that statics are things like food and ammo that you can
    pick up, and actors are the bad guys.  Doors should be
    self-explanatory.

E   Moves you ahead two levels.  That's right, not one level, but two.
    Unlike the W command (see below), this also takes you to the "level
    completed" screen and gives you percentages, bonuses, etc.

F   Displays your current position on the level (X,Y) and orientation (A).

G   Turns what Id calls "GOD mode" on and off.  Basically it just
    means that you're invincible.

H   Hurts you (-16% health).  Not much use to us, but I guess Id had
    to debug their damage code just like everything else.

I   "Free items."  Ups your health, ammo, and score, and gives you the
    next most powerful weapon.  (Machine gun if you didn't have it,
    very large machine gun if you did.)

M   Displays memory usage.  Loads of fun.

N   Turns "No clipping" on or off.  This lets you walk through walls.
    Wall-walking does STRANGE things to the graphics (try approaching a
    door from the side and opening it).  It also does strange things
    to the bad guys.  If you walk into a room through the wall, often
    they won't notice you at all, even if you walk right in front of
    them or fire your machine gun (in some direction besides at them,
    of course).

O   Changes the main viewscreen to a map of the current level, which
    you can scroll through using the movement keys or the mouse.  It's
    neat, but I wish that it wasn't so ugly.  Those numbers are from
    the internal level format.  ESC will get you out.  Unfortunately
    this command doesn't work in v1.1.

P   Pauses the game, without putting up the little "Paused" window.
    I guess this makes it nice for taking a screen shot, although in
    v1.1 it changes the screen border to an ugly white.

Q   Bombs the machine in v1.0.  Exits the game in v1.1.  Both of these
    functions are about equally useless.

S   Turns slow motion on or off.  If you have a slow computer you
    don't need this.

T   Pops up a window which displays graphics and sounds from the game.
    Use the left and right arrow keys to page through the entries.
    If you come to a blank entry, keep going.  You'll know when you've
    reached the end (500-something) because you won't be able to go
    any higher.  ESC exits.  v1.1 has some interesting graphics that
    v1.0 lacks, including two sprites which are particularly intriguing.
    Don't bother calling Apogee and making yourself look like a fool
    only to be told that you didn't win anything; I already did.  (You'll
    understand what I mean when you've seen the sprite.)

V   Asks you how many extra VBLs you want.  High values seem to make
    the game sluggish and not much else.

W   Warps to any level.  10 is the secret level.

X   "Extra stuff."  It definitely does something, but I can't figure
    out what.  Let me know what you find.

There is one other debugging feature, demo recording mode, that is
not accessed in the same way as the other commands.  To record a demo,
follow step one from the beginning of this article, and then hold down
TAB at the title screen (the one with B.J. hiding from a guard).
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way to display these demos
after they've been recorded, but if you've ever had a secret desire
to play Wolfenstein 3-D with a big "DEMO" sign at the top of the
screen, this is how to do it.

Wolfenstein 3D, v1.1 (for the 1st episode at least)

You have to use UNLZEXE.

PATCH   : 90 90 90 90 == == == == ==

With this patch you won't see the blasts when the Nazis shoot at you; those
blasts are pain when you use god mode and a lot of guys shoot at you at the
same time: the whole screen goes red. You still will be hit, however,
if you don't use a patch for health or god mode.

If you want to use the LIM feature, but want to keep your score try this:
ORIGINAL: C7 06 DA 87 03 00 C7 06 CE 87 00 00 C7 06 CC 87 00 00
PATCH   : EB 0A 90 90 90 90 == == == == == == == == == == == ==

And this will get rid of a need to press a key after using LIM.
ORIGINAL: 9A 09 0B 19 17 9A 30 0A 26 0B 83 3E 6F 8E 00 75 03
PATCH   : EB 03 90 90 90 == == == == == == == == == == == ==

All the patches seem to be working, but I only tested them for half an hour,
so no flames please. And ALWAYS SAVE you original file.

Note: I didn't test these patches on all 6 episodes (I have only 1).
My search strings are long I know, but I wanted to be sure there are no more
occurences of these strings in the file.

There is a debug mode for these games:

A+2+<enter>  = Debugging keys  (need to use this one first or the
               others below don't work...)

<F10>+J      = Extended JUMP mode
<F10>+I      = Free Items (gives you all the jewels and a wetsuit)
<F10>+N      = No clipping (float right through walls and ceilings
               and floors ... NOTE: makes you disappear if you're
               already on the main floor)
<F10>+G      = GOD mode (nothing can kill you in this mode)
<F10>+W      = Warp to level (numbered 1 to 18)

NOTE: where a sequence is in <>, you press and hold that key in addition
to the other keys in the sequence. Also, don't press the + for those
sequences -- that's just to make things prettier on screen.


There is also a practice mode available that will give you infinite lives to
practice a certain level.  The only problem with this is that if you use the
control panel, you can only play paddle war or return to the game or the
system locks up.  Also, if you leave the level in any way (finishing it, etc)
the system will lock up.

To practice, boot the game with:  KEEN4E /TEDLEVEL ??
    where ?? can be any number from 0 to 18.

   0 - Shadowlands                   11 - Pyramid of the Moons

	This game was quite easy to solve, without any edits.
However, once I finished it, I found that I had this urge to
make edits to it, just to keep in practice.  So, if you ever
have a chance to play the game, please play it the right way
first, and then go back and make the edits.

	Finding the info was easy as well.  I just played the
game, saved it after I was on different floors, and wrote
down all the information that was on the saved game,
game.dat.  Then, I compared the information based on what
was different about the saved games (# of lives, # of lives
saved, # of grenades, scene, floor, stuff possessed) and
eventually, through trial and error, I came up with the
following information about the file, game.dat:

ELITE PLUS
----------
Status: Untested
Source: Joost Schuur 

A while back I posted a question, whether someone had succeded in decoding
the save game file for Elite Plus and especially the checksum generated by
the programm. I didn't get the response I wanted, but managed to find out
how to get more money then you'll ever need. Here goes:

1. Save games are 226 bytes long, with an at least 16-bit checksum at the end.

2. The string containing the amount of credits, from offset 20 (hex) to 32
   (hex) is a dummy. It is _not_ the actual amount of money you have,
   just the ASCII represenation.

3. The actual amount of money is encoded in at least the three bytes offset
   8c, 8d, and 8e. Convert this number into a decimal and divide it by 10
   to get the actual amount of cash. Thus, 03e8 (hex), which is 1000 (dec)
   corresponds to 100.0 credits. However, the checksum in the save game file
   still prevents tampering with it.

4. The solution: Alter the default game you start of with in ELITE.EXE itself
   with a hex file editor of your choice. The defualt game you start of with
   starts at offset 11366 (At least it does in my version.  Scan the file for
   '100.0 credits' to be sure). Look for the bytes 03 e8 00 (100.0 credits) and
   replace them by 40 42 0f. Now you have 100000 credits whenever you start
   a game from scratch.

5. About half of the future save file can be found in elite.exe and you can
   alter some other values to change name, hyperspace system selected, missiles
   etc. However I just flew my ship from Lave to Leesti (Tech level 10) and
   bought my stuff there, with all the extra cash I had.

   I used Elite Plus release V3.1. I have no idea if there are other versions
out, but the offset I mentioned will most certainly be different then.

Thanks go to Bob Igo for decoding the cash format.

   I seem do have found the bytes that correspond to your rating.  They're
the four bytes before the name (e.g. JAMESON). Strange enough, they're
there twice. In elite.exe at the beginning they're set to 00 00 00 00, and
setting them to ff 00 ff 00 gives you a deadly rating (I think).
00 04 00 04 makes you 'elite' then :-0.

I wonder why they're there twice?

EYE OF THE BEHOLDER II

There may be errors, and if they are detected, please let me know by e-mail.
My address is at the end of the file.


With each item name are the 2-byte hex representations used in the save file.
They range from 00 00 to D3 01 (notice the lowbit-highbit order).  Anything
beyond D3 01 is up to you to explore (beware of system crashes!).

NOTE ON Lowbit-Highbit order:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Machines using Intel 80x86 chips, such as IBM and compatibles, place the
least significant byte first.  That is, Hex digits in a Hexadecimal number
are place in reverse order.  For example, 237643 in decimal is equivalent to
24 42 F0, but it would be represented as F0 42 24 by placing the least
significant byte "F0" first, then "42" and finally "24".
Thus the above example of 00 00 to D3 01 is actually 00 00 to 01 D3, which
is 0 to 467 in decimal.

The save file has the following format: (might not be accurate)

(byte "01")
Character Name: (11 bytes)
Abilities: (2 bytes each, first is current, second is maximum)
           in-order: Strength, Percentage, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity
                     Constitution, Charisma

Notice that there is only one slot for arrows, but it is possible to have
more than one arrow during the game.  To compensate for this, some arrows
are specially numbered to represent the number of arrows a character is

don't take my word for it.

        Not enough lives?  Well, save your game and enter your hex-
style editor with that saved game file open for editing.  Change the
byte at offset 59(hex) to FF.  The FF will give you 255 lives.  The
bottom status screen will be cluttered with "lives", but they won't
affect the game.

MARTIAN DREAMS
--------------
Status: Untested
Source: Arthur Johnson

Obtaining the cheat keys in this game is similar to the process used in Savage
Empire. However, the keys are not laid-out in such a simple list. Using your
favorite disk/file editor (such as ZipZap7.14) that counts from sector 0 and
displays 0 -> 511 bytes per sector, edit "game.exe" in the following way:
   - Goto sector #195
   - Starting at byte #12 ( the value should be $39 and its mate $26), copy
     pairs of bytes to the same sector starting at #232. Skip $EE $2F pairs.
     Be very careful that you get the pairs copied correctly, or horrible
     things could happen to your machine!!! Remember I'm counting from 0 when
     I mention these numbers.
   - The final bytes you should copy will be $F3 $22. All in all, you should
     have copied23 pairs of numbers.
If these bytes don't match at the locations I've specified, you probably have
a different version of the game. In that case DON'T TRY THESE MODIFICATIONS!!!

In any event make a backup copy of game.exe before trying the modification.

ALT-213: time, location, map picture
ALT-214: teleports to desired X, Y, Z location
ALT-215: Wait one hour
ALT-221: Shoot a Divine Flare. Don't know what it does.
ALT-222: De-solidify Avatar to walk through things (party can't follow)
           Once you know the location you can teleport your part to the
           location.
ALT-223: Go to the location of a certain NPC
           Some locations are:
             01 - Yourself

             1c - Buffalo Bill
             1d - Wisp

Alt-224:  Look at an NPC [Using NPC Number]
Alt-225:  Play SFX       [I like this option, neat, if only they had
play music]
Alt-226:  Play SFX Again?
Alt-227:  Change an NPC's flags.
Alt-228:  Talk to an NPC [Using NPC Number, so does Alt 227]
Alt-229:  Do a Midgame!
Alt-232:  Pump Barge Info [I don't know what this is]
Alt-233:  Analyize [No idea here]
Alt-234:  Create Item [Oh, no, not ANOTHER list of item numbers!]
Alt-242:  Heal Party
Alt-243:  Show free k for tiles

Also, teleport to   X: 06F  Y: 07A  Z: 0

SHADOWLANDS
-----------
Status: Untested
Source: Bob Igo

          This cheat is by no means complete.  What I have found out so far is
but a hint of what can be done.  The game uses a rather different technique for
its items, the likes of which I've never seen before.  In most adventure games
that I've seen, the items in the game, even the unique ones, were simply given
by a single hex number, followed by a number which stated whether that item
was equipped or otherwise in use.  By this method, you could equip all your
characters with a unique weapon, regardless of whether or not the game would
allow them to equip it due to their class.

          In ShadowLands, *every* item is unique.  Recall the apples in the
orchard when you start the game?  Yes; each apple is unique, and apparently
points to a central database somewhere (presumably elsewhere in the huge saved
game file).  So is the bow you can get in the upper-right corner of the
wilderness area.  How did I discover this?  Well, first of all it seemed
suspicious that my character with 5 apples had a different hex number for
each apple.  I thought that something like 80 01 meant that he had an apple
which was in his inventory, and that there was possibly a hex shift for the
next apple, which would show where it was in the inventory.  This way, the
position of the item would be independent of where in the character file it
was stored.  I considered this for a while and shrugged.  It wasn't until I
copied the hex value for the bow to one of my other characters that I realized
what I was dealing with.  When one character would fire the bow at a monster,
each bow would be reduced in uses (arrows).  I stared at the screen and
remarked, "Huh?"  Yes; this was one bow shared between two characters.  Imagine
this from the game world's point of view. :)  The thing is, this will work for
a few items for a while.  The shield is not copyable, but I think that sticks
and knives, etc. are.  The problem comes when you go to save your game.  The
program must verify all the character data before saving, because your copied
bow turns to static before the save.  I feel sorry for my poor character who
thought he had a nice bow and was left with static. ;)  Anyway, I'm still
working on it, and it looks like I will be for a long while.  In the meantime,
I have found the following hex offsets in the character file that you can
change to your advantage:

Character #1
 attribute       Offset
------------------------
Magic Level    |  1A51
Cur. Strength  |  1A52
Max. Strength  |  1A62
Max. HP        |  1A66
------------------------

          Because this is a real-time adventure game, and not one in which
time only progresses if you move from square X to square Y, it is much harder
to do file comparisons on the saved data, since so much junk you don't care
about will have changed in addition to the stuff you want to know about.

          Look for more edits to come.  If you have tried editing this or
have succeeded in doing more than I have, please let me know.  In case this
gets widely distributed, my email address is ri09+@andrew.cmu.edu

        If you start with only 5 lives and must go through 11 levels of
harsh battle, I don't think you'll make it, unless you are lucky and
fast enough to get extra lives.  But you can save your game, and
use PCTools to change the byte at offset 5(hex) to 05.  This will
return you to 5 lives.  I tried fixing it with FF, but I found out that
it doesn't work - I lose as if I had no lives left.  You can attempt
to screw around with other bytes and hopefully get more lives
than five.

There are two that I have listed and probably are more.  Both are untested.

The 'spam' cheat:

Talk to Iolo, say  "Spam,spam,spam,humbug"
and then enter a number from 0 to 255.
The game simply converts the ASCII code to an object.


The cheat menu:

Boot the game with  Ultima7 ABCD& 
			     
The & is ALT-255.  Hold down alt and enter 255 on the keypad.  Now when you
start playing press F2 for the cheat menu.
The cheat menu allows alteration of your character, and anyone elses,
teleportation to other places, and other things too numerous to mention,
including Power Avatar (invincibility).

please send me a copy for this list.
