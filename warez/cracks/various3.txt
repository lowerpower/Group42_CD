Another LZEXE'd file.
 
Either UNLZEXE "BREACH2.EXE" and search for "83 c4 02 90 0e e8 2a 48"
                             and change to   "" "" "" e9 93 02 "" ""
OR
Search "BREACH2.exe" for "04 72 48 84 ee be"
        Change to        "89 e1 2a 48 09 dd"
        Look back about 8-9 bytes and the "9a" should be changed to a "3a".
 
        The First way would be the BEST as compression is a tricky thing. I
        tested it both ways and it worked.

NOTES:CRACKER WAS THE FLASH. I HAD TO UN PKLITE CARIB20 TO MAKE THE CHANGES.
        If any of the versions are PKLITEd or LZEXEd you will have to
        uncompress them. If the file is under 60k, then it has been
        compressed. They normally are in the 70k range.
