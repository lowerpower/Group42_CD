Crack> Mean 18: Accolade

crack written by Briggs

     Caution: Do not modify your original disk.
     Copy all your files to another disk or to a subdirectory on your
hard disk and put the original disk away in a safe place.
     Mean 18 does not indicate a version number but the file size for
GOLF.EXE should be 89375 bytes.  The copy protection scheme
looks for a bad sector on drive A.  We will patch 4 calls to this
routine with NOP's (no operation) and patch 1 JUMP to an early
exit with a NOP.
     Put DEBUG.COM (from your DOS disk) in the same directory
or make sure it is in the DOS path.  Type the following commands:

REN GOLF.EXE GOLF.XXX         Rename program for debug
DEBUG GOLF.XXX              Start debug
RCS                     Check contents of cs register
     Retype the 4 digits shown, but add 1 to the left digit first.  The
code that we want to change is beyond the current 64K segment.

E CS:4FE3 90 90 90  NOP the first call
E CS:4FEC 90 90 90  NOP the second call
E CS:500A 90 90 90  NOP the third call
E CS:5019 90 90 90  NOP the fourth call
E CS:5058 90 90     NOP the early exit jump
RCS                 Check cs register again

     Retype the 4 digits shown, but subtract 1 from the left digit first.
Restore the cs register to its original state.
W                       Write file back to the disk
Q                       Quit debug
REN GOLF.XXX GOLF.EXE   Restore file name

     Now run GOLF and confirm that the patch works.

>>>Note from Bob:  If this doesn't work, there are two more cracks I
>>>have on file for Mean 18.

Crack> Their Finest Hour:  The Battle of Britain

crack written by Mike Basford of Canada

     Here's how to get rid of that silly code wheel.
After this you don't have to tune the radio any-
more.
     You will need Norton Utilities or Debug,
Norton is easier.  When using Norton Utilities,
select BOB.EXE and search for 36 24 75 08 B8
01 (using the hex field) and change the 75 08 to
90 90.  Write the data and you're done.
     If you are using Debug:
REN BOB.EXE BOB.XXX
DEBUG BOB.XXX
R                   use the value of CS for the next step
S CS:0000 FFFF 39 87 36 24 75 08 B8 01 00 8B E5
                    replace CS with the value

(Debug should respond with something like
this:
CS:xxxx xxxx     is used next)

U xxxx     use the value from above in place of xxxx

     (You should see:
CS:xxxx     CMP [BX+2436],AX
CS:yyyy     JNZ 7762)

E yyyy     use value from above
75.90 08.90       you type the 90s
W
Q
REN BOB.XXX BOB.EXE
     Now run it and have fun.


Crack> Pool of Radiance by SSI

crack written by Les B. Minaker of Canada

     Requirements:
PC-Tools or Norton Utilities
     I was getting really annoyed at the copy
protection with this game, so I got out my sector
editor and started poking around.  Eventually I
found the answer.
     First install the program normally by unarcing
it onto your hard drive or 7 floppies.

     *Note:* I had absolutely no luck unarcing it onto
floppies.  It took me an hour and didn't even run!
(But, it did install to the hard drive O.K.)  Part of
the install is configuring the program for your
system.

     Once you have the program installed:

1. Find the file named START.EXE and rename
it to something else like STARTBAK.EXE.

2. Copy the file STARTBAK.EXE to
START.EXE.  This renames the original and
makes the copy the executable program.

3. Using PC-Tools VIEW-EDIT mode or Norton
Utilities Hex Editor, call up the file
START.EXE.

4. Find the 13 following words with the Hex-
Editor and change each one to HAHAHA (or
any 6 Capital letters - not lowercase!) and save
the changes to disk in the file START.EXE:

>>>Note from Bob: It's easier to change all the
>>>words you find to Hex 00.  Then, just press
>>>'enter' when asked for the code check.
>>>However, his way works as well.

BEWARE, ZOMBIE, NOTNOW, COPPER, DRAGON, EFREET,
FRIEND, JUNGLE, KNIGHT, SAVIOR, TEMPLE, VULCAN,
WYVERN

5. When you enter the program and are asked for
the code from the Translation Wheel, type
HAHAHA and you're in!

     That's all there is to it.  It is understood, of
course, that this unprotect is only to be used by
legitimate owners of the game - who have tired o
spinning that &%@# code wheel!


Crack> Paladin by Omnitrends

crack written by Jim Bello

     This patch will remove the jump to the docu-
mentation check in Paladin.

     Use PCTools or Norton Utilities to search for 3B 46 FC
75 0B and change the 75 0B to 90 90.

     The Documentation check window will still
appear, but just hit 'enter' and the program will
run.

steps: 

RENAME GAMES.EXE GAMES.XXX 
DEBUG GAMES.XXX 
S 0000 FFFF 0B C0 74 01 to search for the protection pattern 

     The computer should respond with only one address.  If 
none or more than one is given, this deprotection may not

Crack> Elite Plus by Microplay 

crack written by Vartan Narinian 

>>>Note from Bob: I am corrected; this wasn't extremely 
>>>nasty to do.  In his words, it "wasn't so bad." :) 

OK, I finally hacked it. Here's what to do: 
Search for: 
BE 0F BF BF 2B 30 E8 E3 FE E8 BD FE 
Replace the first two by: C3 00 
Search for: 
2E 89 6F C8 E8 B1 24 E9 34 1C 
Replace the first four with NOPs (90) 
This takes care of the check if the word is correct. 

To actually remove the question, 
Search for: 
E8 FF 19 BF D9 06 81 C7 C4 06 B0 18 BB 5A 00 
BA 0A 00 B9 93 00 FF D7 
Replace the first three and the last two with NOPs (90). 


Crack> Eye of the Beholder II 

crack written by anonymous (send questions or comments 
to ri09+@andrew.cmu.edu and I'll forward them) 

This is a nice 1-byte crack for Eye of the Beholder 2. 

The boys from SSI tried to be tricky, (maybe unknowingly) 
but I got through their BS anyway. 

They had some funky way of reading the key-board. I'm still 
not sure how they did it, but Hey... WHO CARES!!!! 
Besides that, putting the protection way INTO the game makes 
things harder sometimes.... (not this time :-)) 

Basically, what this crack does is the follwoing...... 

The program does the following: 

1   Get input 
2   Encode / decode etc. etc. etc. 
3   Was it the right one? 
      If so JUMP and continue the program 
      If not, return to protection routine. 

My patch changes the "If so JUMP" line to "JUMP ALWAYS" 

So the patch: 
   Scan for:   83 C4 08 0B C0 74 14 47 
                              ^-------------Change to EB 

Thats it..... 
   Have fun. 

Crack> Centurion 

crack written by anonymous (send questions or comments 
to ri09+@andrew.cmu.edu and I'll forward them) 

This is a (maybe THE) crack for Centurion. 

To make it accept any answer as input: 

Scan ovl0.ovl for 5B 5B 0B C0 74 06 FF 46 FE 
                   CHANGE THE 74 TO EB 

If you do not want to press return: 
Scan centurio.exe for AF 02 E8 19 CE 2B F1 F9 
                 CHANGE THE E8 19 CE --> B8 0D 00

crack from bboard 

(Version 1.2 only) 

          1.  Rename AFT.EXE to AFT.XXX 
          2.  Enter DEBUG with AFT.XXX open for editing. 
          3.  At the DEBUG "-" prompt, type 

              U 0DBB <ENTER> 

Several  lines  with  be displayed on screen. You are interested in the first 
two.  They should look EXACTLY like this: 

              xxxx:0DBB  E9A3A7         JMP   B561 
              xxxx:0DBE  C3             RET 

The "xxxx" represents any four hexadecimal numbers.  If you have a match, 
on  to  the next step.  If not, you probably have the wrong version.  Sorry! 

          4.  At the "-" prompt again, type 

              U 0E38 <RETURN> 

Several lines of code will again be displayed on screen.  Look at the first 
two following  the "U 0E38" command.  They should also match exactly with the 
following: 

              xxxx:0E38  880E5005       MOV  [0550],CL 
              xxxx:0Exx  8A0E4D05       MOV  CL,[054d] 

If you have a match here, then you should  have  a  compatible version of the 
AFS program.  If not, sorry! 

          5.  At the "-" prompt, type the following: 

              E CS:0DBB 90 90 90 <ENTER> 
              E CS:0E38 C3 90 90 90 <ENTER> 
              W <ENTER> 
              Q <ENTER> 

You should now be back in DOS.  Only one more step left. 

          6.  Rename AFT.XXX back to AFT.EXE 

That's it!  You now have an unprotected copy of AFT.

     The protection scheme can be bypassed with Central Point 
Software's NOKEY (distributed with Copy II-PC), or you can 
search through ST.EXE for CD 13 and replace it with 90 90. 
     You can use this patch with most software that NOKEY works 
with, since you are NOP'ing out the INT 13 that checks the disk 
drive.

replace the 75 09 with EB 03 then write the data 
and you're done.  Now at the verification screen, 
just type enter.  (You still have to put in your name 
though.)

Crack> Civilization 
 
crack written by the Mooncrow 
 
This is a quick and simple unprotect for Microprose's CIVILIZATION game. 
The unprotect will remove that annoying request at 3000BC for information 
regarding the requirement to achieve some randomly selected technology. 
 
FILE: CIV.EXE (mine is date stamped 12/03/91) 
 
Look for the following hex byte sequence: 7D 05 CD 
It should start at hex offset 276D. 
 
Change the "7D" to "EB" and save the modified file. 
 
This patch changes the JGE instruction to a JMP and makes the program assume 
that you have already answered the "protection" question. 
 
One additional benefit from this unprotect is that you can use the SAVE GAME 
feature as soon as you have completed the first move in the game.

This is not quite right because it assumes that ds = cs. The e 
command 
enters the bytes in the data segment. If ds happens to be equal to 
cs, then 
all is OK. If not, you'll be changing the wrong bytes. 
 
Use 
E CS:0DBB 90 90 90 <ENTER> 
and 
E CS:0E38 C3 90 90 90 <ENTER> 
instead. 
 
Hack in Peace! 
 
 
Crack> Escape From Hell 
 
crack from Computist Magazine, written by anonymous 
 
     Better grab a microscope if you haven't got a cracked version. 
This doc check asks about some monsters whose tiny pictures appear 
in the manual. 
 
     Since the portion to be altered is not in the first segment of 
the file, you will have to use Norton, or another good editor. 
DEBUG won't work, unless someone knows how to find where DEBUG 
loads additional segments. 
 
     Below is a list of offsets of the byte to change in the file 
ESCAPE.EXE.  Go to the followinf offsets one by one and change the 
bytes 75 05 at each offset to 90 90.

crack written by anonymous 
 
>>>Note from Bob:  This was tested on version 2.0 as well and it 
>>>worked fine. 
 
                      Unprotect for Test Drive III 
                      ---------------------------- 
 
This unprotect is for version 1.1 of Test Drive III.  (The version 
number is marked on the original disk.)  The TD3.EXE file size is 
138317.  The date and time are 12-3-90  1:42p. 
 
This may work with other versions or it may not.  Your mileage may 
vary, so always work with a copy. 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Method 1 (Debug) 
 
Using Debug: 
 
   RENAME TD3.EXE TD3.XXX 
   DEBUG TD3.XXX 
   U 480 
 
The first two instructions you see should be: 
 
   JNZ    0487 
   MOV    BYTE PTR [0088],01 
 
Change the JNZ to two NOP's: 
 
   E 480 90 90 
 
Save and rename back to .EXE: 
 
   W 
   Q 
   RENAME TD3.XXX TD3.EXE 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Method 2 (Hex editor) 
 
Find the hex string: 
 
   75 05 C6 06 88 00 01 
 
In TD3.EXE.  Change it to: 
 
   90 90 C6 06 88 00 01 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
The "cop quiz" will still appear when you start the game.  Just type 
in ANY number - 0 will work fine.  The cop will still tell you "Wrong, 
you can only play for 2 minutes" but what he doesn't know won't hurt 
him.  The game will play exactly as if you answered the question 
correctly. 
 
It would have been just as easy to eliminate the "cop quiz" entirely, 
but it's a good graphic so I let the nice policeman hassle me once 
at the beginning of the game.  Only now his tickets are no good.  :-)

crack written by anonymous 
 
>>>Note from Bob: The kind netter who sent this to me said that he has 
>>>heard complaints that this won't work on some of the newer versions 
>>>of Ultima V.  It worked fine on his however. 
 
The file size of my copy of ULTIMA.EXE is 36576. 
The date is 06-24-88. 
 
I hope this is of some help! 
 
To unprotect Ultima V try this:  (On a copy, of course!) 
{Don't type in the comments in curly brackets.} 
----------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
rename ultima.exe ultima.xxx 
 
debug ultima.xxx 
 
-d 10e 111 
 
17E5:0100  6E 09                                    n. 
17E5:0110  64 00                                    d. 
 
{If you don't see the "6E 09" and "64 00" here then your copy is 
 different than mine and this probably won't work.} 
 
-e 10e 3b 1b 00 08 
 
-d 114 117 
 
17E5:0110  00 00 1C 08                               .... 
 
{Check for "00 00 1C 08".} 
 
-e 114 22 03 2d 07 
 
-w 
 
Writing 8EE0 bytes 
 
-q 
 
rename ultima.xxx ultima.exe 
 
{done} 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Or use your favorite hex editor (Norton's, etc.) and change the 
string 6E096400 to 3B1B0008 
and 00001C08 to 22032D07 
 
Change the first occurrence only!  The second string appears in the 
file several times. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
This just changes the .EXE file header so that execution begins after 
the key disk check.  My copy is kind of old so I hope this still works.

Below is a small TSR. It is a cheat & crack by someone else
which I modified so that it is only a crack. Just load it before
Budokan. Unfortunately it can not be uninstalled from memory.
It is unlikely that you will find a search and replace type crack
for this as it is reasonably well encoded and does several clever 
self checks to make sure it is not modified.

Crack> StarTrek 25th anniversary by InterPlay
crack written by Michael Yakubovich (U94_MYAKUBOV@VAXA.STEVENS-TECH.EDU)


	I really need someone's opinion on the StarTrek.  I didn't play
StarTrek much, so I don't know what's gonna happen on the second doc check and
so on...  I tested the patch only for the 1st star, so please send all comments
to my email address.

CRACK   : A1 84 01 A3 82 01 90 EB ==

Note: The color of the planet you see on the screen when arrive won't be
correct, but it doesn't matter; the rest is all right.

Doesn't work alone (needed if you want to change configuration), use the above
patch too.

Crack> F-29 Retaliator by Ocean Software

This one also needs testing, I din't play much myself (did it for a
friend), so I'd like to know the results.

Crack> Jack Nicklaus Golf
crack written by anonymous

This program is protected by a code-wheel lookup, and is hideously easy
to defeat.  This patch will work for the following version of the game:

	GOLF     EXE     82503 09-19-90   9:52a

The file is compressed with LZEXE v0.90, and its uncompressed size is
146164 bytes.

So, to crack it, uncompress it with UNLZEXE, and change offset 3BDC:
E8 56 F5 to 90 90 90.  This will completely bypass the code-wheel prompt
and verification.

Addendum
--------
To crack the course designer, UNLZEXE the file DESIGN.EXE (size 76307,
date 09-19-90), and edit offset 2C47: 9A 34 -> EB 03.

Crack> Chuck Yeager's Air Combat
crack written by Michael Yakubovich

FILE: YEAGER.EXE
First, unOPTLINK the file; if you don't have any utility to do this use NU6.0,
NUCONFIG program which lets you expand OPTLINKed files. Be sure to rename 
YEAGER.EXE to one of the file NUCONFIG understands (DE,SF,etc.).
