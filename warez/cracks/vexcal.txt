     If you're wondering, yes, this is a fairly old game, but not as 
old as Fireteam 2200, which I last cracked. This one was even more 
difficult, using self-modifying code. At first, I thought it was easy, 
after finding the protection code in memory. But when I used Norton to 
seek and edit the code, it was nowhere to be found. Apparently, there 
was a routine at the beginning of the program which copied small 
pieces of code to memory where it was then executed sequentially. No 
thanks to "Using Assembly Language" by Allen L. Wyatt (QUE publishers) 
for not giving me any detail about how MOVSB works. If you're looking 
for a really crappy assembly language book, buy this one.
                                                                     


                                    
     Use Norton or another hex editor to search the file GAME.EXE for: 
                
                        75 22 91
       and change to:   74 
 
Happy Pirating!
