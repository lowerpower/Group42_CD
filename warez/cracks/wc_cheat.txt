             --->>  Invincibility for Wing Commander  <<---


The following cheats will give all four of the available ships 9999 worth
of armor. This should be enough to get through to the end of the game,
even if you go like a bat out of hell. The offsets assume you have something
like Norton's diskedit, or hexed (available at simtel).

Beginning Offset:        Change to:
17F47                    0F 27 0F 27
17FB6                    0F 27 0F 27
18025                    0F 27 0F 27
18094                    0F 27 0F 27

Also, to get rid of the copy protection at the beginning of the game try:

Offset:                  Change to:
4A2DF                    CB

That should do it for ya!
