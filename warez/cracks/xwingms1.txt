After finding out the X-Wing crack from the EPIC TRIO Software Group
did not work after mission disk one (Imperial Pursuit) was installed,
I decided to try hacking it myself.

I worked out that the TRIO crack altered bytes 79840-2 (hex) in the
file frontend.ovl from E8 6D 29 to B8 01 00.

After fooling around for an hour I eventually found a place in the new
overlay file where the code looked pretty much like the old one, and
edited the appropiate bytes, and, lo and behold!  It worked.

So, after installing the Imperial Pursuit Mission Disk, use XTree Gold
or Norton's Disk Editor or something to go to position 7BE50 (hex)
and alter the bytes E8 75 29 to B8 01 00 (or search for the pattern
to find the right position).

NOTE:  THIS IS FOR THE GAME LOADED STRAIGHT OFF THIS DISK.  IF YOU
INSTALL THE LOCKING PATCH AVAILABLE AS ip1a.zip ON, E.G., FTP.UWP.EDU
IN pub/msdos/games/temp, THEN SEE THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE.

So, here's my first ever IBM crack.  Well, OK, it's not really mine,
I just used a bit of lateral thinking & TRIO's old crack to do it.
Thanks go to the Trio Guys.

I then decided to decipher the file the TRIO guys used for the original
X-Wing crack to work with their file altering program.  So, if you get
their hackit.exe file out of the original crack archive (xwingcrk.zip)
and then use the following as the .hac file, it'll fix frontend.ovl for
you automatically, so you don't have to bother about using XTree or Norton.

Standard Disclaimer:  Use at your own risk, works for me.  Make a backup
of the original frontend.ovl just in case (I suggest doing this for
any change).

The use of the names XTree, Norton, and Norton's Disk Editor is in no
means meant to undermine their copyright, etc.  In fact, I heartily
recommend such products.  Norton is registered trademark of Symantec,
XTree Gold of the XTree Company, X-Wing (or the X-Wing Space Combat
Simulator, at least) is one of LucasArts.

NB:  IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED THE LOCKING PATCH FROM ip1a.zip THEN THE ABOVE
WON'T QUITE WORK.

This is because frontend.ovl has been enlarged slightly, and the position
to edit the bytes has changed to 7BEB0.  Searching for the byte pattern
will still work, however.

For this new frontend.ovl use the following hac file:
