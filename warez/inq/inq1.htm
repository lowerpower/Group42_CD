<PRE>---=[ Introduction ]=----------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
<P>Welcome to Inquisition issue #1.   
<P>Basically this is an introductory issue.  This first week will be more and less a introduction of Inquisition to the rest of the Scene.  Like <A HREF="http://www.hooked.net/users/tails/wwn">WWN</A> - We feel the need to inform the public on the actions

 of the scene and what the hell is going on with the groups and the people who lead them.
<P>We decided to leave the <A HREF="http://www.hooked.net/users/tails/wwn">WWN</A> name behind, and if you miss it - too bad :) The staff is basically the same with myself an addition to the Editor position.  For the time being - Inquisition will be using

 the same format as <A HREF="http://www.hooked.net/users/tails/wwn">WWN</A> until we have a nice newsletter hammered out.
<P>Currently we are looking for Coders and Writers.  If you want to join, but you are unsure on what all you are responsible for, leave us mail. We still want YOU to write in comments on our newsletter, even if they are negative.  We prolly publish them i

n our next issue and one of the editors will reply to them.

<P><H2><CENTER>Welcome to new utils scene report from Jimmy Jamez.</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>I decided to start the show again and all the point totals from zero..coz we missed several kick-ass weeks coz of WWN editors' problems and other shit.  Now I am writing for a different mag; hopefully you will enjoy this thing as much as my previous wo

rk in <A HREF="http://www.hooked.net/users/tails/wwn">WWN</A>.
<P>Lets start..  I will review last week affairs on the utils scene from the 1st till the 8th of October, 1995. Nice week for both utils and games.. It reminds me that some old freaks are still alive and scene is not dead with the beginning of a new schoo

l year (hint! hint!). What we had in general?? Big fucking fight on games scene about some lame sports game..  We really don't care about that, but this board fight hurt some util groups a bit too :(..  Our old gay friend, Karim, from TDU-JAM shows that h

e still has big bullshitting power..  Anyway, lets forget about him and do not make him and his lame game group (as they all are) any advertisment.
What we saw in utils??  Let me show you some best group's reports. Of coz all biased..so..if you dont like some points - do not complain and make your own report.. or <B>better</B> release something that will get cool points here.
<P><CENTER><B>* in alphabet order *</B></CENTER>
<P><B>DOD (Drink Or Die)</B> - Nice explosion on scene with the first days of October. Totally, the group released around 150 megs of stuff on this week.  Impressive to compare with lame and slow september.   What we saw here?  Of Coz long-awaited Visio 4

.0 for Win/Win95 Technical Edition (16 Disks).  On the same day DOD released an elite programming tool from Borland called Codeguard 1.0 for Borland C++ 4.5 (28 disks).  So far this is the best Borland title for the last 2 months (good points too).  And o

n the next day, we saw ultra-new IBM OS/2 sequel - their answer to NT - OS/2 Warp Server Beta.. It is still in development and was spreaded over the globe in 12,000 copies.  DOD grabbed one of them and released for the OS/2 fans.  The rest of the week we 

saw silence except for the last weekend day when DOD appeared with 3 more store titles called Mini Office 2.1 for Win95, cool home office system from UK, (6 disks), IBM Dictionary of Computing for DOS/Win/OS/2 (4 disks), and a new version of Back Exec Ent

erpise 7.01a for Netware/Win from Arcada.  Of coz, I forgot to mention the very first DOD October releases - 2 new titles from 
APC labs called PowerChute Plus 4.2.3 for Netware (3 disks) and for NT (1 disk). In general, the week was good for DOD; not the best that we saw from them but not the worst at all.  No the maximum point coz of the lack of titles and release numbers. Megga

ge is not the main thing on scene :)
<P>Current week points :        <B>9/10</B>
<BR>Overall rating      :        <B>9/10</B>
<P>PNT (Pantera)</P> - After deep thoughts, I finally decided to include this young posse into my special report edition.  Here we go - Hope they will stay here as much as they can :).  Lets review the week of those kids right now.  Week started for them 

with title called Icon Author for OS/2 (10 disks).  Kinda bigfor an icon editor but still OK and will get krad points when I calculate this 
week's score.  After that we saw couple of OS/2 warez (looks like that this team releasing only for OS/2) like Deskman/2 and SimCit 2.4 for OS/2 (dunno if it's necessary to include this into the report).  Week finished on that.  Maybe they had some more r

eleases but best boards missed them.  So, trade your stuff better and i will review them too.  Stay cool!
<P>Current week points :        <B>4/10</B>
<BR>Overall rating      :        <B>4/10</B>
<P>PWA (Pirates With Attitude) - Scene dinosaurus work in the same stream! 5% of commercial store releases and the rest from internal sources or betas. As DOD, they had not the best week but not the worst too.  Let me make a trip over their releases for p

ast 7 days.  On the 3rd of October, Pirates released long awaited NT title called Diskeeper for NT Workstation (7 Disks).  Best defragger for NT ever made.  Right after that they came with a weird educational package called Teachme Windows95 (2 disks).  W

ho knows what the heck it is and, who needs Windows95 lessons :).  Anyway somebody will use it and, we will take it with some cool points.  But, the next release put me in a depression.  Chineese Pro for Win95 - Mdaaa..Chinese and PWA - 2 words that canno

t go together.  Hope this will never happen in future.  Good that they fixed this fuckup with a killing PowerSoft update of PowerBuilder 4.02 (19 disks).  It reminded me to keep my eyes open on new Win95 versions of this best-of-the-best piece of code.  P

WA also released internal Microsoft Beta of program called Game Development Kit (11 disks) and in the last day, nice Photoshop Plug-in Blackbox 2.0.  Due to this chinese fuckup, I award them less points.  Lets wish them good luck on coming week!
<P>Current week points :        <B>8/10</B>
<BR>Overall rating      :        <B>8/10</B>
<P>RBS (REBELS) - New group in my report too.  These europeans show that they can compete with util monsters and release quality software too.  Lack of titles this week but still had something.  What?  Good question. Here we go - There were Microsoft Inte

rnet Explorer for Win95 (1 Disk) and a huge release of Lotus (aka IBM) Smartsuite 4.0 (37 Disks).  It is not what i expected from 
Smartsuite (i expected SmartSuite 95) but, anyway, it is cool!  Activate your european contacts and bring us more cool stuff in future. See ya in sweeden
<P>Current week points :        <B>5/10</B>
<BR>Overall rating      :        <B>5/10</B>
<P>Thats about all for the special edition part on this week.  Not sure to include PINNACLE and RIGID in next one or not.  RIGID releases a lot but many of their things are dupes.  PINNACLE supposed to be very cool but very idle now.  Time will show us al

l on next week.  If you have any information or complaints about my report.
<P>C'ya on next week, Jimmy Jamez [DOD BoSS]

<P><A NAME="Interview_TSR_Razor"></A><PRE>---=[ 2. Interview - The Speed Razor - Razor 1911 ]---------------------------</PRE>
<P><B>WWN</B>:  Did you start Razor 1911?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  I didnt start RAZOR it was started a few years ago back in 1985 by Sector9 and some others.
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  OK
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Next.
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Do you feel Razor is dying?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  As far as the floppy side, yes. It is evident that it is dying since all of the quality game producing companies have turned to CD-ROM only games
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Who had the idea for the T-shirts?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  Ahh I believe that was The Gecko
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Have you guys sold alot?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  A few hundred :)
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  Wow =)
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Do u think RAZOR will start rippin cd's?
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Like TDUJAM and HYBRID?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  Well RAZOR has been around for many years and is the oldest PC group around and yes RAZOR will be starting to release CD's under RAZOR CD Division about this Tuesday :)
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  That is nice to know 
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  We are ripping 2 CD's so once they are done satifactorily then we will release them
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  How do you think it will fair against groups like TDUJAM AND HYBRID?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  I think our first month like the others will be a learning month and a time for us to grow.  So, I'm hoping, for us, to be giving the rest some stress in November and December just in time for the Christmas rush and, I think Hybrid's noti

on of, "We own Europe is crazy," cause during the floppy scene we DOMINATED Europe and CD's will be the same :)  As far as TDU, they have a great store pickup, so that will be one area for improvement
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Do u think though that RAZOR will become a SUPERIOR FORCE?  Once again or flatline out in the GAME department?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  I think we will rock again.  The game is the same - who can nail the most titles and if you look at the ware reports you'll see who did what in 95 and why I think the Blade will slice em all once we get fully into CD's
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  We were #1 in all categories - most titles #1 and most megz #1.  
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  With all the new games on CD's, which are HUGE, will groups start releasing 200-400 meggers?  Due to the increase in speed, thanks to ISDN, in the near future?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  I think groups might, later, release bigger CD's as ISDN becomes more popular, so that we dont have to lose on some of the quality that is being ripped out 
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  Let there be no doubt when I go on record, RAZOR has the resources and I know how to manage them; however, the CD Division will be seeing some friendly faces leave as they have they're own commitments 
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Alot of people are saying RAZOR is a dinosaur, RAZOR is dying, THE FLOPPY years are over.  What do you say to them?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  RAZOR Dead?
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  People have been saying that it is a dying group
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  Well I guess the critics are always quicker to jump to conclusions rather than fact but, I think they will just have to wait and see how dead the dinosaur is and if the Blade remains DULL or will it slice em
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Will RAZOR want to stand alone against TDU and HBD or is there a possible merge?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  A merger with who and why???
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  With another game group
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  For less competion
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  It wouldn't be either of those - maybe we would absorb some smaller groups but nothing with the Hybrid who has some of RAZOR's worst enemies - including TRC who was kicked out of RAZOR and Chainsaw Massacre who tried a FAILED coup 
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Will the RAZOR team expand alot?  When the CD division opens?  Or will you stay a tight group?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  I think we will definately be adding more members who can contribute to the group as well as seeing some of the old faces from RAZOR floppy not appear at RAZOR CD like EOS a senior member who has generously contributed to the success of t

he group
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  And Roland, a supplier who also runs The Wall who will be staying in TDU-Jam
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  More on the shirts, what inspired you guys to do the shirts?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  The shirts
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  Uh I guess we wanted the people to have a souvenir of the scene and what better to have than a shirt which would represent the scenes best group who have supplied more PC titles than any other and also is the oldest PC group
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  And what do they look like?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  Black shirts inscribed in the front on the left in small is RAZOR in kewl lettering and on the back it says RAZOR then a picture of the Blade then 1911 then 1911 in Roman Numerals, definately a souvenir that can be cherished for a lifetim

e and also to be worn to computer stores and trade shows etc..
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Who do you feel will be your main competion when you start up again?  And  who was your main competition then?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  I think the first thing we will go out and do is retake Europe then strengthen US but no doubt it will be Hybrid and TDU-Jam who are neck in neck between themselves so it will be interesting to see what happens when a third player joins t

he party
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Before we say goodbye, do you have anything you wanna say to the scene?
<BR><B>TSR</B>:  Dead - Just watch and see us come from the grave and haunt !
<BR><B>WWN</B>:  Thanks alot for this interview TSR.  I and the scene really appreciate it
<P>This interview was conducted by Lurch on October 2, 1995.
