<P>This week we had a couple of comments, but we would like more.
<HR>
<P>Greetings,
<P>I read the letter to the editor from Subterfuge that was in this weeks article, and pretty much agree.  I like the way JJ is doing the scene/group rating.  But, I guess I would like to see a whole new catagory that describes and rates the warez. (Altho

ugh this might not work if this new catagory is not updated frequently for obvious reasons.) 
<P>Other than that I like what I'm seeing. 
<P>Keep up the good work,
<P>- The JeneRaL (619/801)
<HR>
<P>Raptor -        Currently we are trying to add a section which reviews utils of  the week we are currently writing about.  Hence we cannot review all the utils nor the games, but we will try our best to cover the mainstream programs.
<P>We wil accept outside reviews, articles and other warez related topics.  Thanks for expressing your wishes.

<P><H2><CENTER>Biased Utils Report made by Jimmy Jamez Issue #3:</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>Woah!  On the whole, I can characterize past week as week of inside releases, betas, and cracked sharewares (this is a habit already :) ). First part of the week had some store titles but the rest had nothing worthy besides anonymous release of Quicken

 95 for Windows 95.  All we saw from major groups - many betas, many cracked shareware programs, many inside  preorder utilities.  As I thought, this week will show us bigger competition than before, and a few smaller groups were more active.  Lets comb t

hrough the  main events of the week and the groups now:
<HR>
<P><CENTER><B>* in alphabet order *</B></CENTER>
<P>DOD (Drink Or Die) - Store kings had a hard time this week.  Because of the lack of store titles, there were only 7 releases and around 70 megs.  Not a valid result for this hardcore Russian Posse, but not it's fault that lazy publishers delay with shi

pping.  Mostly all the stuff came from inside sources and only couple of releases were from stores.  Week started for them with  Monarch for Windows 2.0  (4 Disks).  After that they came with one of the best releases of the week - MS Visual Basic 4.0 Stan

dard.  FINALLY first real RELEASE of Visual Basic 4.0 version.  We still hope to see sometimes soon PRO and ENTERPRISE editions.  Next day - next release.. nice MAC <-> PC conversion program Conversion Plus 3.0 for Windows.  On that, store heaven finished

 for DOD and they started to compete with others on internal applications. Quality won this time and we saw Lantastic 6.01 for DOS/Win/Win95 (5 Disks) and Quarterdeck WINProbe 4.0 for Win95.  DOD finished this week with 2 big utilities.  One long-awaited 

Oracle SQL-Net Connectivity 2.0 for Win95 (13 Disks) (all Oracle stuff released by DOD lately..way to go!) and a huge CD-RIP of electronic greetings designer called Animated Greetings from Pinapple (19 Disks).  Last one is too big for it's aim but, it's f

ully commercial and new. Not the best week to compare with the other weeks on the past but, the group started to show ability of inside contacts and releasing.  One point is taken for small release number & meggage.  You will ask why only 1 point?  Becaus

e we saw no betas and three very, very cool titles like Visual Basic, Lantastic and Oracle programs.
<P>Current Week Points:         <B>09/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:              <B>28/30</B>
<P>PNT (Pantera) - I am happy.  I finally stimulated this team to work better and they really gave us the ultimate trip through their neverending releases. It started with ZIP Office 1.25 for Windows (5 Disks), Selected Office Pro 5.1 (too many offices, b

tw <g>), OpenMind 2.0 from Attachment (3 Disks) and finished with bunch of unknown but legit things like PC3290 4.1 beta for OS/2 (huge beta.. bah), Netwizard 2.5 for  Win/NT and Win95 (7 Disks), Baryan Enterprise Client 6.0 (long awaited title of main No

vell competitors),
and finally Crosstalk 2.3.1e for Win and Win95 (5 Disks).  The week totals to 7 releases, nothing big and well-known except Baryan but no fuckups so far and no dupes.  If these kids will work as hard as now - I wish good luck to PWA and DOD in the future.

  One beta release takes 1 point off, but all the rest collects a lot.
<P>Current Week Points:         <B>09/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:               <B>15/30</B>
<P>PNC (PiNNACLe) - They are still half-dead. :(  Only three titles and two of them were a bunch of CD-ROM Adobe Photoshop manuals and help programs.  Kinda big so they are not earning many points.  There were Adobe Photoshop Tutorial Series 3.0 (16 Disks

) and Fundamental Series 3.0 (12 Disks).  They finished the week with Netscape Commerce Server 1.1 for NT on (4 Disks).  That is a cool release.  Good luck to them on next week!
<P>Current Week Points:         <B>04/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:               <B>09/30</B>
<P>PWA (Pirates With Attitude) - Time passes but PWA is the same! :)  Many big betas, couple cracked sharewares (this week they loose on this aspect to the REBELS, haha), and couple store utilities.  Lets get a ride of their releases for last 7 days.. Her

e we go:
<BR><LI>Microsoft Voice, Speech and Phone Beta 2 for Win95 (6 Disks)
<BR><LI>Interecho 1.12 for Intermail (1 Disk)
<BR><LI>Univebe 1.5 cracked (another PWA cracked shareware, hehe)
<BR><LI>IN3 Voice Recognition Cracked (hehe, how much more? :)
<BR><LI>OnNet 2.0 for Windows (15 Disks) (cool inet junk)
<BR><LI>Small Intuit proggy Quicken Expensable 1.1 for Win
<BR><LI>WinBeep Cracked (some shareware pager software successfully cracked by PWA)
<BR><LI>Long long awaited PCBoard 15.22 for OS/2 100 nodes (4 Disks) (sysops say thanx to them!)
<BR><LI>Watcom C++ Class Builder (c) Powersoft (10 Disks)
<BR><LI>FileNet PrintFlo 2.0.33 (5 Disks)
<BR><LI>NT Client (1 Disk)
<BR><LI>Borland C++ <B>5.0 Beta 2</B> (31 disks), very cool and only STORE title
<BR><LI>Windraw 4.0 for Win95 (14 Disks)
<BR><LI>Windows NT Beta 4.0 Server & Workstation
<BR><LI>Mindwire BBS for Win/NT
<BR><LI>Win95 (9 Disks) (what the heck is it?  Somebody install it on a board - i will call to have fun!)
<BR><LI>& 1 small util at the very end of the week, Test Archive Virus Scanner (1 Disk).
<P>Also need to mention one very rude fuck up releasing MS Explorer 2.0 beta that is double fucked -
FREEWARE and DUPE of PNT :)  We all can log to www.microsoft.com and get it directly from the first screen.  What can i say?  Shitload of meggage but 4 betas that got 70% of those meggage and also 1 dupe/fuckup.  Anyway, the team released other fine utils

 that can and must award fine points. 
<P>Current Week Points:         <B>09/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:               <B>28/30</B>
<P>RBS (Rebels) - Very impressive.  These Swedens exploded with many utils and cracks on the past week.  Want to just mention MS Windows NT SNA 2.11 Server (25 Disks), Diskaccess for Windows 95 cracked, DS Standard Netware Tool for Win/Win95 on (5 Disks) 

and a few others.  Also they were prolly jealous of PWA for cracking elite shareware/demos and beaten them fully on this week in that! 5 small cracked/unlocked things.  I am glad that somebody is doing this dirty job - cracking sharewares!  Have fun and r

elease us some cool sweden blondes next time.
<P>Current Week Points:         <B>08/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:               <B>10/30</B>
<P>As you could notice - nobody got perfect points. Because nobody actually WON! Each group did the best in one way and lost in another.  Anyway, competition was rocking and we would like to see something special soon!  Hope next week will be that special

<A NAME="Malice_Interview"></A><P><PRE>---=[ 3. Interview - Dorian Hawkmoon - MAliCE ]-------------------------------</PRE>
<P><B>WWN</B>   : Rumor is or was that Ordnance asked you if he could be a Council member in MAliCE.  Is there any truth to this?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: Not a rumor.  This is true.  However, the MAliCE council was not in agreement with allowing him in.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : Another rumor is or was that you purposely brought RTS into it's doldrums type state as it is in now, is there any truth to that?  While Ordnance was gone, of course.
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: It was never my intention to "kill off" RTS.  No RTS member was approached by me personally to join MAliCE.  People made a choice and applied to MAliCE.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : Why MAliCE?  Meaning - Why did you choose MAliCE as the new frontier in couriering?  Why not stick it out through in RTS?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: Well, if people remember, (and I hope some of the senior members of the scene do), MAliCE was a great courier group in the early 90's, and one of which I was an important part of then.  So when it came time to do something new, I felt t

hat the name would make people realize that the group was making a comeback, not a new "fledgling" group.  RTS had a lack of responsibility in senior positions.  NO one person can run a courier group by himself.  MAliCE has a "council " of people who are 

dedicated to making this group #1.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : To our knowledge, MAliCE has 8 INET sites?  Needless to say, is MAliCE an INET couriering group?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: MAliCE is hardly in INET group. Although we do run that many net sites,  we are very much into the BBS scene as well.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : Percentage wise - How many MAliCE couriers are LD, NET, and Both?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: Strict net couriers - only 10%, LD people - about 20%, local board couriers - about 30%, and couriers that do both - about 50%.  That's over 100% becuase of an overlap of duties.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : What do you think about RiSC?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: NO question RiSC is the #1 courier group in the scene today, as well they should be.  They have had little competition in the last 2 years.  I like their organization, but I do not subscribe to the "Upload to the Top 10 boards only" the

ory.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : What do you think about EVR (Everlast)?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: It's hard to make a judgement on a group that has so few people in it, and one that appears and disappears so frequently.  The guys who are in the group definitely know how to play the game though :)
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : What do you think about fATE?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: I will try and be objective here.  And, just state that I don't see much of their stuff on the boards I call.  They claim to be the #2 courier group in the scene, but I think most people see things in a different light.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : What do you think about HTC?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: HTC is about where RTS was just before it died.  I don't see a future for HTC unless they revise their senior staff and get back to basics.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : What do you think about RTS and it's future?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: RTS will always be there.  Whether it ever amounts to anything again, your guess is as good as mine.  If the right people are put in place, I would imagine they could be a competitive group again.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : What do you think about any future couriering groups out there?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: Good luck:)  Seriously, I'm sure we in MAliCE would welcome the competition.  People seem to forget that MAliCE is only 5 weeks old in it's current phase.  So, we are still essentially, the "new" guys in town.  But, we'll take on anyone

 in the future.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : <A HREF="http://www.hooked.net/users/tails/inq/inq2.html#Interview_The_Snake">Vile was quoted</A> in our <A HREF="http://www.hooked.net/users/tails/inq/inq2.html">last issue</A> that MAliCE would put a dent in RiSC's market.  How do you

 guys plan to do so?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: Reveal our secret plan? :)  That wouldn't be fair.  Let's just keep them guessing.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : To our knowledge, MAliCE has one Distribution Site.  How does one's board become a distribution site for MAliCE?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: Actually, distribution sites just need to apply.  Minimum of three nodes is required, and reputation of the board is important  WE do have a lot of affil sites and many member boards too.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : What are the requirements to be a courier of MAliCE?  Essentially, what does the Staff of MAliCE expect out of the couriers?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: Couriers are required to support their assigned boards.  For board couriers that are local, we expect sizable uploads in meggage per week. For LD people, we expect dedication to uploading the MAliCE name to give the group exposure.  And

, for our net couriers, we expect movement of releases to sites ASAP as something comes out onto the net.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : Back to the "Top 10 Board Theory," what is the theory of MAliCE?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: Anyone that knows me pretty much knows my theory.  Courier groups were created for the sole purpose of mass distribution of files.  I would  much rather "create" a fast board in every AC in the country, rather  than have people upload t

o boards that would be fast regardless of  which courier groups support them.  There will always be independant  traders for that function.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : What group does MAliCE officially courier for and what exactly does that mean?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: WE "officially" courier for Pinnacle right now.  What that means is that PNC gives us the releases first, so that we can spread them throughtout the scene.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : What are your theories of tagging?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: Honestly?  Tagging is bullshit.  I would like to see a return to the days when a courier group is rated based on how well they support the boards they choose to upload to.  Because, no SysOp really cares if a MAliCE guy uploads RiSC tag

ged files, or vice versa.  All he sees is that the MAliCE guy uploads 200 megs a week.  And that makes him happy, and it should make the sneior staff of the courier group happy too.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : So, it is safe to say that the best courier group is the one who uploads the most to their boards rather who carries the most files tagged?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: You can easily find the same releases tagged by 3, 4, or 5 different courier groups.  I would have to say that uploading meggage to a board is more important.  NO one judges an independent trader by how many files he couriers bearing hi

s NAME do they? 
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : Here is a scenario that all courier groups have - You are the Official Couriers of PNC, however one of their suppliers is a member/courier of fATE, who gets the tag?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: That is a very disturbing scenario.  Unfortunately, it seems the release groups have not set any standards for that.  I would like to think that the groups would agree that if they are going to have official couriers, then they should h

ave all their releases given to the OFFICIAL couriers first.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : Since you dislike the fine art of tagging, will MALiCE drop it in the future.
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: NO.
<BR><B>WWN</B>   : Where do you see MAliCE in the future?
<BR><B>Dorian</B>: MAliCE is here to stay I believe this time.  AS long as I am around (not in a rocking chair yet!), MAliCE will always strive to be the #1 courier group in the world.

<P>Interview Conducted by Raptor on October 21, 1995.
<A NAME="Article_NFO_and_Packaging"></A><P><PRE>---=[ 4. Article - NFO's and Packaging ]=-------------------------------------</PRE>
<P><CENTER><B>NFO's and Packaging</B></CENTER>
<P>Well, I guess this might be a bitch more than an article, but I'll express my views and ideas as more of a suggestion.  
<P>Every group out there, whether util/game/established/new/cool/lame/etc is the same in this respect - they package with a compression utility (ie PKZip), use an NFO, and use a DIZ.  Pretty simple you would think, eh?
<P>Afraid it's not.  Most groups that are established like Razor 1911, PWA, DOD, NTA, TDU-JAM and countless others have complete NFO's and DIZ's to help the scene's layman understanding what exactly their leeching.
<P>On the other hand we have Independents and groups who don't give a damn about what their sticking out there.  A fine example of this was Vendetta (VND), and their dead now anyhow.  Anyways they put out a damn vendetta EXE and a  DIZ.  I mean that reall

y does a Sys-Op any good for file management or for those who want to know more about what their leeching.  Any dude can move a file to Point A to Point B, but not all of us have ISDN lines, so we might be a little more selective in what we're downing.  H

ence we unpack that NFO  to read what the hell we're sucking down.
<P>This is merely a suggestion, but it would be nice or convient if groups/independents take up the idea of including a date of the release, version numbers, operating systems supported, installation instrctions (if needed), and a fairly decent descriptio

n of the program.  
<P>I can understand that games' groups are in a different catagory, but the utils' scene is not even as competitive.  Hell - I have sat on releases for a week or so and no one has put it out, no biggie.  So what if it takes an extra few minutes to put out

 a description of decent length.  
<P>I think it's pretty sad when a group says - "Here's Symantec Act! v2.0" "Uh - have fun"  - Cool - gotta a release but what the hell is it?
<P>Like I said, most of the groups out there have descriptions on their releases, but a few need to improve their NFO's a bit in this area.  
<P>A DIZ should include proggy name, version number and OS - once again it makes it simple for Sys-Ops and the ever-so-important dupe checks.
<P>There also is the rush of CD software on the market.  CD's are here to stay, so we better get used to them.  If a group decides to rip, make sure you say that it is a Rip.  It might be obvious, but then again - some traders might be doubtful in moving 

the rip due to a future nuke off a board b/c it doesn't work for shit.  Anyhow, that's just my beef on rips.  Well maybe I'll add  that people need to use ZipChunker instead of ARJ.  Simple fact that ARJ does not use a 32-bit CRC integrity check on the AR

J.  Many groups have been burned  due to ARJ compression and recompression CRC errors.  Recently though, I have  changed back to the ARJ compression utility but I just have to take that extra minute to check the CRC integrity.
<P>I like to send a personal greet to TDU-JAM and HYBRID for using the simple install EXE's for all of us who do not like to deal with arj and the  parameters that go along for repacking and all that jazz.
<P>Once again - this is just a opinion and well if you think I am full of shit well - go ahead and think that.  Read the next article.

<P>On October 23, 1995 - Orion, President/Founder of PWA, announced his retirement.
<HR>
<B>-ThePrez-</B> Ok when we started PWA 3 years ago, people didn't think we would make it.. ACtually a few people (no longer with us), tried to break the group up. But being mainly consisting of adults we  hung thru it all to Make PWA the best there was, 

the best there is and the best that EVER will be...
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> So for Three years we have shown people that without cut throat competition a group can survive and take themselfs to the top.
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> Well its time for you all to take this group onward further then I can take you all... I am retiring from PWA, for reasons that really aren't that clear to me at this moment, but its best for my life right now...
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> But before I go completely out, I wanted to clear a few things up
<BR><B>*</B> Marlenus looks very sad
<BR><B>*</B> Blackhawk pouts
<BR><B>*</B> Bainster wipes his eyes ...
<BR><B>*</B> mario_ sighs
<BR><B>*</B> Raptor is sad
<BR><B>*</B> Corv8 will miss ThePrez's great sex
<BR><B>*</B> Blackhawk is NOT going to ask....
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> First and foremost, the Council has the final vote on the group, Period end of sentence,, Sr. Members do have a vote in the group activity, but the Council vote is the last stand
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> The Council should act as a single person with one objective in mind, whats best for the group.. over the past few months it has gotten away from that.... And its time to get back into it..
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> ok council members, Rambone, Blackie, Marlenus, Snake,  you guys need to get this under control...
<BR><B>-RAMBONE-</B> already workin on it
<BR><B>-Marlenus-</B> your wish is my command
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> There is NO group coordinator, there is though a council with each having indiviual responsibilites
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> Those people under you all are your responsibilty
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> All supplies and couries are invited
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> So in a nut shell, change the nfo from Orion President to Orion Founder... Yes Ego has taken over and I still will be in the nfo hehe
<BR><B>-Marlenus-</B> i bet he joins DoD tomorrow :')
<BR><B>-Marlenus-</B> prez, its been great working with ya, youve been a swell fellow, ill see you in vegas, and bone, delete all his leech accounts tomorrow :')
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> I just want a promise from you guys, especially the ones that have been thru PWA when it was doing 20 megs a month to when we were going 300 megs a month, (When Blackie knew what piracy was) now he just get laid..
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> PWA is a standing for people not to take this shit seriously, if a hobbie like stamp collecting, a far better hobbie I think, but a hobbie non the less
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> But seriously guys don't make me come back from retirement to kick all your asses, its not a pretty picture of me being black and wheelchair running over your toes if you don't keep the beliefs of PWA alive
<BR><B>-ThePrez-</B> Well guys thats about it in a nut shell, now its your turn to throw the questions if any back to me,, I said my peace, nothing more to add to it........ sigh
<BR>In the last two months, we have seen two great leaders, Liquidator and Orion,  step down to allow new blood to represent the scene.
