<P>This week we have had great deal of mail.  I would like to thank of of those who sent mail and greeted us on the IRC.  Also like to include that TRC (The Renegade Chemist) sent his regards of displeasure of the mag to us due to our lack of regard for g


ames.  Well TRC, hopefully we have supplied enough in this mag for you satisfication.  Here are our selections of mail:
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="blue_lin.gif"></CENTER>
<P>Man guys, nice issuse, best one of the WWN/INQ by far!  Keep up the good work guys..

<BR>- Raptor - Thanks!

<HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT>
<BR>- Raptor - Check out the Announcemnet by Lurch!
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="blue_lin.gif"></CENTER>
<P>It would be nice if there was an archive of warez released kept.  What I mean is maybe putting the list of warez in a table, or just in any old text file format.  Instead of listing PWA's releases seperate, put everyone's releases into one big file.
<P>Anyway, the important thing I'm getting at is that there should be a search field setup.  You can do this with switch. It would be cool if you could just type in a ware and see if it was released or not..
<HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT>
<BR>- Raptor - Well, that is where dupe checking comes into place.  Most major boards contain lists of older warez put out. Unfortunately, they do not release these lists, so you must call them to get these lists.  They become quite large in a short perio


d of time.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="blue_lin.gif"></CENTER>
<P>Well,
<P>1st time at the INQ url for me.  Do not spend much time on the web.  Anyways, 14 yrs in the scene almost 15, I seriously thought the scene has changed when I started up Pantera on Dec 4, 94.  It has though, but this is classic material here. (re: url a


nd such).  Though iIwas bouncy with the PC in and out, though Mercy knows me from the ancient Atari days.  So to continue and skip the
bullshit its 6am EST time now or so.  Pantera has been get lotsa support from the other great groups though we are not great but an OK rookie group for the year of 1995.  We have survived members that fucked up the group to almost a complete down fall, an


d many other things.  I know there will be more to come, its part of a group trial and error.
<P>Just dropping by to say a big FUCKIN HELLO to Jimmy J. & Lester.
<P>And found it to be very inspiring like all issues, issue #4.  And that would like to say absolutely on that fact about MS and Novell being hard on pirates. I think novell is much worse though, because they hold an lic agreement how ya not supposed to x


fer there wares across different countries or some shit like that, its a form of esponiage or some shit.  I use to work for Apple sorta still do :)  But they have the same agreement, if you read between the lines which is always important, it states this.



<P>Well, I think thats all I wanted to say.  But before I end this, Pantera says thanx as a whole to ya people, because we have leanred that our closed old fuck ass minds can open up.  Though very true on the under 20 age thing, very true.  A lot of minor


s get pissed at me because we discrimante against age. Oh well, I think I have rambled on enuff, but we all say thanx from the bottom
of our souls...
<P>And in clsoing we hope to add much more (will sure do our part in the future).
<P>Thats all folks (basiclly whoever reads this),

<BR><CENTER><H3>Biased Utils Report made by Jimmy Jamez Issue #5:</H3></CENTER>
<P><HR>
<P>November started and scene was really frozen with the first snow.  We had many betas, many big CD titles, but nothing that I can call <B>AWESOME</B>.  Guess that software publishers decided to move all their shipping dates to late November or Christmas


 time. :(  It is really sad; anyway I will show you what groups released but will not write it as detailed as usually.  Hope this will be changed next week.  Here we go
<CENTER>* as always in alphabet order *</CENTER>
<P><B>DOD</B> (Drink Or Die) - Describing my group work is always difficult.  I try not to be biased in this way and hope you understand that.  DOD had very strong October (strongest month in DOD's history actually), and the first 4 days of November were 


empty.  We all prolly heard some rumors flying around about a possible DOD disband or splitting to other groups but that remained rumors and, the group is back to business again.  All week, till the weekend, was slow and empty, but the weekend produced 9 


releases in 2.5-3 days. We saw KAPLAN GMAT Roadtrip 96 (5 Disks), a couple of CD Deluxe versions of popular programs - Microsoft Publisher 3.0 (16 Disks) and Quicken 5.0 for Windows 95 Canadian Edition 96 (8 Disks).  In the same day we saw a small title -


 Quicklink Message Center 2.1.0 (2 Disks) and a big bundle of Internet Connections (c) IBM - versions for OS/2, AIX, WINDOWS, and some security gateways.  Good releasing for last 3 days of the week.  Titles came from well-known and respected firms and no 


betas occured.  Especially that DOD procalimed that it will not release any betas ever except for some awesome ones, very rarely.  We will see how DOD will work this out.  Good points but not perfect.
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>07/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>45/50</B>
<P><B>PNT</B> (Pantera) - Group is showing us stable work, still nothing really serious but betas, inside things usually for OS/2.  Sometimes they fuckup releasing some lame games, but other stuff is OK.  Lets look at what they released during the past 7 


days.  PrivaSoft 1.35 for Windows (1 Disk), IBM Antivirus for WIN95 BETA, Database II WWW for OS/2 Beta 3 (2 Disks), ZIP! Console 1.11 for Windows (4 Disks), Giecks Engineering Formulas for Windows (9 Disks) and IBM Antivirus 2.3e for NT were their releas


es.  Nice ammount of stuff but as we see, 1/3 of their titles are betas.  Also, usually they release OS/2 stuff and they made some rude fuckup releasing - some old OS/2 Games pack (that came with OS/2 Fun Family Package CD).  Hope they will try harder nex


t time.
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>05/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>28/50</B>
<P><B>PNC</B> (Pinnacle) - Really thought to include them to my reports in future or not.  Some of seniors of PNC got their ego tripping and tried to press on me to write some good shit about them.  What can I say?  I DON'T have anything against this team


 and always tried to support it as all other perspective groups, but, looks like they dont like critics.  This week they kept releasing betas plus a nice try of a <B>BOMB</B> explosion releasing so-called <B>QEMM 8.0 'FINAL'</B> that in was actually a <B>


FINAL</B> beta :). Guess it was dedicated to all kids who never look inside archives and just trade those files through their modems. Anyway we found out what the heck it was.  Now let me show what else they did on this week: Iomega Zip tools & Drivers fo


r OS/2 (2 disks),  some ware called Career Shop (1 Disk), Autodesk CyberSpace Developers Kit FINAL (somebody need to compare that with previous version, previous one is really old), pcAnywhere  for Win95/NT BETA (4 Disks), those QEMM 8.0 Beta and HyperMan


 1.0 (1 Disk). The group seems to work better this time, but just one piece of advise - do not try to press me next time or I will make you some bad advertisment.
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>05/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>17/50</B>
<P><B>PWA</B> (Pirates With Attitude) - PWA brought us no suprises this time.  Still the same stream, many big betas, many big CD inside programming stuff and a little number of store things. Only mistake they made that time is that they forgot to list BE


TA in their file_id.diz files in 2 BIG programs and, many dudes really were pissed off when they leeched final programs as they thought and found betas inside.  Hope dudes will pay more attention to packaging next time.  I mention Imagineer Technical BETA


 (13 Disks) and Solid Edge (20 Disks).  Now let me tell what else they did besides those 2 beta monsters. First day of November had Micrographix Crayola Art Studio 2.0 CD (17 Disks, Business Vision II Delta 2.13 (3 Disks), Visual WorkFlo 1.1 (6 Disks), Tr


ansjamer Vol.1 Transition (2 Disks), Calendar Widgets for Windows (3 Disks), small Pinnacle CD_R proggy called RCD MM 3.0, Integra Business App. Builder 3.0 (7 Disks) and WorkFlo VBX 1.11 (2 Disks).  The group shown stable work everyday but no surpises or


 cool titles.  Anyway they were awarded good points.
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>08/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>46/50</B>
<P><B>RBS</B> (Rebels) - were kinda dead during the week.  We only saw 2 programs released: pcAnywhere 3.0 for Windows 95 (2 Disks) and Site Express 3.0 for Netware (9 Disks)  Nothing more to tell, low points. 
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>03/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>18/50</B>
<P>So, the report is over this time.  I was suprised to see some activity from other groups like <B>TITAN</B>, etc.  If they will try harder I will include them in next issues.

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="blue_lin.gif"></CENTER>
<P><B>=Rapid Assault=</B>
<P>Tdujam, 6 disks.  It's a doom style game (1st person overview).  You are in a car and given certain objectives to complete usually within a certain time frame.  Then you are told to find the flag and then on to the next mission.  The graphics coulda be


en a little less chunky.  Involves the usually shooting, assortment of weapons and explosions.  Kind of like Here's a password to get you past the 1st mission: <B>SEAWORM</B> (it might have an "S" added to it, I kinda forgot.)
<P>RATING: <B>68/100</B>
<HR>
<P><B>=Navy Strikers=</B>
<P>Hybrid, 4 disks.  Hybrid say's its a flightsim, but I couldn't figure how to get the plane off the ground (and I can usually figure out most any- thing) because there was so much tech stuff.  The game appears to be more thinking then flying around and 


blowing up shit.  It does have a nice assort- ment of video clips and camera angles.  Only for the person looking for a hard challenge (getting the plane off the ground, who knows how hard the game is.).  It did have a nice music track however.
<P>RATING: <B>51/100</B>
<HR>
<P><B>=Mordor v1.1=</B>
<P>Tyranny, 2 disks.  D&D type of game.  There are no graphics that I was able to discover, except the icons and pictures.  Appears to be 100% wordy.  It's like one of those mud games you can play, where you choose from dwarves, humans, elves, etc.  Nothi


ng spectacular, had a nice midi track. 
<P>RATING: <B>42/100</B>
<HR>
<P><B>=3D Table Sports=</B>
<P>RazorCD, 5 disks.  Those classic arcade games that didn't involve staring at a video screen now available in the "stare at your video screen" mode.  Foozball, air hockey, and hoops.  They can be played over the modem or network.  The games were little 


disappointing, for several reasons, 
<BR><LI>(1) in foozball you can't control which thing to move, it picks it automatically and you just hit spacebar 
<BR><LI>(2) air hockey moved a little too quick and the things can be moved all over the board as if we all had magical 10 ft arms
<BR><LI>(3) hoops is kinda unfair since the computer can practically make all shots it takes.
<BR>The graphics are nice and crisp, but I didn't get any sound or music during the game, but when it was over there was some crying sound effect.  Anyway, it was a nice effort, but it lacks the good gameplay that could hold you for more than 10 minutes.
<P>RATING: <B>70/100</B>
<HR>
<P><B>=Flames of Freedom=</B>
<P>Flame?, 5 disks.  Yuck!  Talk about shitty graphics.  It's an adventure game.  Disgustingly ugly graphics and the sound ain't  much better.  Dont bother with this one.
<P>RATING: <B>20/100</B>
<HR>
<P><B>=Arena CD Deluxe=</B>
<P>Legacy, 14 disks.  Didn't seem to want to work, no matter how many times I followed the directions or tried some other way.  Heard it sucks anyway.
<P>RATING: <B>NA/100</B>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="blue_lin.gif"></CENTER>

<P><B>TekWar</B> - Reviewed by The Black Knight
<P>You've read the books, you've seen the syndicated TV series, now play the game!  This 1st person Doom-clone from Capstone features an ex-cop in the year 2045 who must wage war against Tek - a devastating mind alterant.  Once framed for selling Tek, you


 have been recalled from prison in fear that a new form of Tek (the Matrix) is on the verge of being released to the public.
<P>Game play resembles the familiar Doom interface with some new bells and whistles.  One of the most immediate noticeable improvements in the game is enemy AI.  Tekgoons will duck, dodge bullets, and run away when they realize they're getting whipped. ;)


  Also, most enemies won't shoot unless you have your gun drawn (the / key hides and pulls out your gun).  Running around the city with a drawn gun also gathers much unwanted citizen attention ("He's got a gun!").
<P>A modicum of environment interaction has been added.  For example, if you see a large pane of glass - shoot it.  Little touches like head bobbing while running can be toggled on/off.  You can duck, jump, and throw on a rear-view mirror to see who's sne


aking up on you. 
<P>The look and style of the game plays more like an unfeeling version of _Rise of the Triad_.  In VGA mode, enemies and objects appear like cardboard cutouts. This lack of feeling culminates in fighting, a very key aspect of the game.  Shooting at cutout


s is, well.. boring.  While walking through levels you frequently find the screen blinking red (representing being shot) without any signs of the enemy.  Playing in SVGA mode naturally makes the game look better, but you pay the grave price of staggered m


ovement - even on a P75. Regardless of what mode you play in, the game definitely is not dominated by fast and furious play. 
<P>Level objectives usually involve running around town looking for blue and red keys, another trite theme borrowed from Doom.  However, one of the early levels involves blasting through an enemy ran hospital.  Any John Woo fan will have a huge grin as th


ey are vicariously transported into the finale of _Hard Boiled_ :)
<P>So, if you find yourself wanting to play against intelligent enemies for a change, give TEKWAR a try.  For an easier time, just play against your friends with TekWar's modem and 2-16 player LAN capability ;)

<P><B>Fatal Racing</B> - Review by Gremlin
<P>Fatal Racing is a fun little racing simulator that reminded me of Slipstream 5000, released earlier this year.  The gameplay and graphics are nearly identical except for one major niggle that I'll talk about later.
<P>Unlike Slipstream 5000, this one is rooted firmly on the ground, except on those tracks that contain so many lumps, bumps and jumps that your car is actually airborne most of the time.  The computer pairs you up with another driver based on the car you


 choose to drive.  There's many to choose from, and although they all look basically the same (dinky EuroSport cars), they all have different strengths and weaknesses.  After you pick your car and set up the other game options (there's plenty), you're off


 to race track after track, each increasing in difficulty.  Points are awarded on the basis of your laptime, position, and the number of other cars you take out of the race permanently by colliding into them and running them off the road.
<P>This game is fairly fun but unlike Slipstream 5000, this one has a real problem with the animation framerate.  Until I turned off many of the graphics detail options, I couldn't get a playable framerate at all.  Even then, it was only barely acceptable


.  I have a Pentium 90, 16 megs of ram, and a Diamond Stealth with 2 megs of VRAM.  That's a fairly muscular computer for playing games.  I don't know what kind of machine you need to run this thing at full tilt boogie, but I sure wish I had one.
<P>Still, if you can turn off enough options to make it run smoothly, this is a fun and worthwhile game.  I recommend it to any fans of fast Monte Carlo style racing.

<A NAME="Interview_Hoson_Hybrid"></A><P><PRE>---=[ 4. Interview - Hoson - Hybrid ]-----------------------------------------</PRE>
<CENTER><H3>Interview With Hoson of Hybrid</H3></CENTER>
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Who founded Hybrid and when?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : I founded Hybrid together with a german guy called LowTec back in Winter 1993.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : So it is an Euro group correct?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Yup, correct.  It used to be ran from Europe, but a few months back, Bluewater and his old CD group, Dynamix, decided to join us.  So, I guess you can say it's not Euro based anymore, but both US and Euro based.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : If you were to rate Hybrid in realsing vs. TDU, RAZOR, ECLIPSE how do you think you stand?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Well, I personally think that our releases are the <B>BEST</B>, they are nicely packaged, most of the time.  They work, we have a cool intro, and all files fit onto 1.44 floppies.  TDU releases have the ugliest NFO file, and Razor CD-Ri


ps are a bit unprofessional, but they seem to get better.  Eclipse, well I'm in Eclipse as well, and since there's not so many floppy titles anymore, Hybrid of course releases alot more stuff.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : What do u think of RAZORCD and do you think they pose a problem in competition?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Yeah, they got a good grip on UK and US, so they pose a real threat, but it's nice with competitoin.  The good thing about CD-Rips is that not just anyone can go and release a CD-Rip.  You have to work with the game before you release i


t, and since Hybrid has the best crackers (Randall Flagg, Cyber, Excessive Knight et cetera), we often win 'coz we crack and rip them quite fast.  To be able to crack and strip CD titles, not only must you be good at cracking, you must also know alot abou


t game programming and Assembler coding.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Could you rate the CD groups from best to worst?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Yeah sure, 1. Hybrid 2. Razor 3. TduJam 4. hmm.. are there any others worth mentioning?
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Will HYBRID stay in the games scene or branch off to utils, since there are alot of utilis on CD now?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Games only.  Never utils.  I hate utils, 'coz 75% of all utils are not useful.  Most util releases sux.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Who do you think has a better grip on suppliers TDU, HYBRID, or RAZOR?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : I think RAZOR and HYBRID.  TDU - nah.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Do you think HYBRID will ever merge?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : No, I don't think so.  Merge with whom?  RAZOR or TDU?  Haha..
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Who are HYBRID's offical couriers, and do you think HYBRID with ever have a couriering section?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Well, we don't have any official couriers, since we don't really need them.  I mean game releases spread themselves, and we already have quite an impressive courier section with BBS/Internet couriers.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : IF Hybrid were to have official couriers who would it be?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : RiSC
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Any big releases from HYBRID in the near future?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Yeah, I've got a few aces up my sleeve.  A few big titles we're getting inside, but I'm not gonna reveal the names coz it would look bad if I said we were gonna release a specific game and then perhaps Razor or TDU would release it.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Why does HYBRID's realses tend to have virii?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : VIRUS?  Hmmm...  They don't.  I know Caesar II had a virus in the VESA.EXE file, but it wasn't in all versions.  I heard something about a virus in Fatal Racing as well.  I have no virii on my computer, so I doubt it contains one.  It m


ight be my encryption of some .EXE files that some virus killers identifies as possible viruses.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Do you guys have or planning to have a web page?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Yep, check the pre-web page out at: <A HREF="http://www.tripnet.se/~electro/home">www.tripnet.se/~electro/home</A> out.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : What about the DYNAMIX MERGE.  What are your feeelings show?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Well, without that merge we would probably not have released ANY of the US releases that BlueWater, ChainSaw M., and Celestial Wizard put out on regular basis, so that merge was a big leap for us.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Didn't Chainsaw M. leave RAZOR for HYBRID?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : No, he didn't.  I don't think he ever was in Razor. :)
<P><B>INQ</B>   : What is the WHQ?
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Park Central is our WHQ.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : We're going to name off a few things - I want ya to give me your opinion on the topics we name off.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Razor 1911/Razor CD
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : I'm sceptical; they don't deserve that name, but they do release alot of good games.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : TDUJam
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Very ugly NFO file, really cool intro, terrible installer, way too many non-working releases.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Utils Scene
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Lame.  NTA always release cool stuff though. DOD are kinda cool, but they put out to much SHIT that no one downloads anyway, it just files for traders so they can earn their credz... bah!
<P><B>INQ</B>   : The GEcko
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : The Gecko?  He is a nice guy!  I was in NEXUS together with him for one month or two.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Eclipse
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Cool!  Good style, good release if not to many lately.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Courier Scene
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Don't know too much about it.  What's so fun with a courier group? Getting famous for pumping meggage here and there.  Nah, I'd say they're excessive, but RiSC's cool.  Good FTP sites and stuff.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : FanFan
<BR><B>Hoson</B> : Don't know him personally.  He might be a nice guy, but he's probably one of those who doesn't stand being defeated.
<P><B>INQ</B>   : Well we don't want to name off all your competitors.  :)  So I would like to thank thee for your time and efforts to INQUiSITION.

<A NAME="Interview_Ordnance_RTS"></A><P><PRE>---=[ 5. Interview - Ordnance - Rise To Send ]=-------------------------------</PRE>
<P><CENTER><H3>Interview With Ordnance of RTS</H3></CENTER>
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Why did RTS break-up?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Well, what allowed it to happen was my being out of the country for an entire month.  Dorian took charge in my abscence.  Upon my scheduled return, I found the group in a very chaotic state.  An example being, half the members did no


t have access to a single RTS site.  And were quite vocal about it.  As my life began to stabilize again, I dedicated time to getting things in the group straightened out.  The major stumbling block I ran into was not knowing any of our new members.  And 


I was not communicating well with Dorian.  So plainly things were fumbling in the dark.  Both Dorian and I felt that we needed another senior to help straighten things out. Because Stargrove kept me updated while I was on vacation, I felt he was the prope


r choice.  And the group voted for him.  But Dorian, though he did not tell me at the time, felt very strongly against that decision.  One of the reasons he cites for leaving.  So less than a week afterwards, MAliCE was formed with Dorian and Aslan. And d


ue to the poor state of RTS, many people left over a short period of time with the "bandwagon".
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Do you feel that Dorian took down RTS?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : I don't believe that Dorian was actively trying to get RTS into the poor state it was in.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : So how can a strong couriering team die under Dorian, I mean he is running MAliCE - can't the same be said about them?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Yes, you could say the same about MAliCE.  But then again, I have worked with Dorian for over a year, and do not doubt his leadership and ability to run MALiCE.  However, I believe that it is only natural for him to be more dedicated


 to a new project - a change of scenery.  But only he can tell you whether or not he cared anymore about RTS towards the break up, or if he was already fixated on re-forming MALiCE (for the 3rd time).
<P><B>INQ</B>      : How many people remain in RTS?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : There are approximately 30 or so members active.  Which is half of our peak membership.  We cannot afford dead weight at this point in time.  And that gives us an advantage.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : In your opinion, was Dorian trying to gain total control of a major couriering group, or improve the scene by creating a more organized group?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B>  : I don't believe that either were the prime motivators for Dorian reforming MAliCE.  Dorian was in MAliCE way back when, and that is where his heart belongs.  When RTS was first formed, Dorian wanted it to be MAliCE.  And he staged a


 major attempt in March to break up RTS -- once again to form MAliCE.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : So where does RTS stand now?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : RTS is gaining ground rapidly.  We have dedicated members who are truly giving their all for the group.  There are plenty of resources out there for the taking, and be assured that we have them.  My personal hope is that soon those f


ormer RTS members in MAliCE will return.  These are people I have worked with closely, and I would like to do that again.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : What happened to all the old RTS sites.  As far as I see, all the members of both MAliCE and RTS have access, but who do these sites belong to now?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : RTS has completely private sites, as does MALiCE.  These are our main sites.  The site-ops of the other sites have decided to grant equal access to both groups, and I respect that decision.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : MAliCE recently picked up PWA as being their official couriers and is attempting a merge with fATE.  How does this affect RTS?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Both Dorian and I worked with PWA back in RTS.  But the MALiCE image has the advantage.  RTS is in the position to impress PWA, and hopefully soon the affiliation will be safely back in our hands.  In the meantime, the competition be


tween MALiCE and RTS remains friendly.  I do not harbor enemies.  As far as MAliCE's dealigns with fATE, I know very little about it.  However, I have had extensive discussion with Anti-Derivative in the past and will consult with him on the matter.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Many people have the idea that RTS is dead.  Was this something that came up by accident, or something done by Dorian/Malice to further shake RTS couriers to MALiCE?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Well, of course there were chants of "RTS is dead" by MALiCE.  But we're proof that willpower can overcome death.  And the rest of the scene will become aware of it if they aren't yet.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Most groups give their releases to certain couriering groups to get the "tag;" where does RTS stand in this picture?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Tagging is an issue of exposure.  I cannot comment on our dealings with any groups, but even so RTS couriers are representing us on major boards in steadily increasing force.  It is inevitable that this kind of representation will ea


rn us more resources, a domino effect.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : What are your opinions on tagging?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : At one time the major couriering groups were few in number and wholly BBS-based.  But since the massive transition to the Internet, tagging has become a ridiculous pastime and hard to deal with.  But as things currently stand, RTS wi


ll not pre-tag, double-tag or strip files.  I am very strongly against pre-tagging. But if RTS' policy on the others change, I will discuss it first with the other groups.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Does RTS encourage its couriers to leave some kind of identification mark with their upload to sites, such as MAliCE's [Malice] file?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Yes, we do.  Not everyone is capable of memorizing NFO files.  Some of the members have been slacking as far as identification, and they will be given a personal reminder :)  May I remind you, however, that our prime purpose are BBSs


.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Do you have a current NFO?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : As of this interview, the latest NFO is October 22nd.  There is a reason for this.  The reason for this is that I am waiting for some major new resources to be confirmed, such as well-know traders and board affiliations.  But they ma


y be pushed back a few NFOs (just to keep the world wondering).
<P><B>INQ</B>      : So what is your opinion of RiSC's "Top-Ten Boards" only?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : I have nothing against the "Top-Ten" philosophy.  Mine is to compete with RiSC on those "Top-Ten" boards, and support those boards which couldn't make the Top Ten.  There is something to be said for benefitting the entire scene.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Most of the RTS couriers, who have moved to MAliCE, are primarily INET couriers, some both INET and boards, do you feel that MAliCE is more of a Net couriering group because of this, or do you think that MAliCE is still very strong co


mpetition for board couriering for RTS?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Yes, I would agree that MAliCE has more of a presence on the Net. But statistics have no relevance -- the respective performance of their BBS and Net couriers is what to look at.  MAliCE is of course strong competition, to answer you


r question.  But I am not worried about it in the least.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Will RTS compete on the Internet?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : No, for the time being RTS will not be concerned with the Internet. RTS' coordinators and myself are putting all our efforts into bringing quality members onto the team.  I have not found someone capable and dedicated enough to coord


inate a Net couriering division for RTS on his own.  Our staff must live up to high standards. Mainly members to spread to boards.  We are well aware of strategic boards, and dedicate ourselves to finding traders to fill those niches.  But of course, we w


elcome applications.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : What is considered a strategic board?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : A strategic board is one where we have found a weakness in other groups' support, one whose Sys-Ops we would want to influence and/or one where we could have a close impact on a releasing group.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Do you feel RTS' main goal is speed or distance?  i.e. Getting it to the top boards, or getting it to the most boards?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Speed and distance are the same basic things.  Speed will get your tags on big boards, impress a few, and get them spread all over, impressing many.  Distance just doesn't impress the select few watching the big boards ;)
<P><B>INQ</B>      : This is a standard question, where will RTS be in the future?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : In the near future, there should not be any reason to doubt RTS' stability.  Hard work is paying off; we are growing stronger by leaps and bounds every day.  There is no reason for that pattern to end.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Getting back to the subject of Malice.  Do you think that some couriers in MAliCE will see RTS as being more prestigious for them to be in and return to RTS?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Yes, I do expect former RTS members to return.  MAliCE cannot be perfect, and their reputation certainly isn't.  As a group, I believe RTS offers more to our members.  I know these people individually, and have kept in touch as much 


as possible.  Already I have support from within MALiCE.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Aren't you afraid that Dorian will claim that you stole MAliCE members?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : That would be crying wolf.  RTS does not bribe or lie to people. If he were to say that we "stole" back former RTS members, I ask who "stole" them in the first place? :)  I do not disagree with Dorian's recruiting ethics.  He made an


 offer which was taken.  I can do the same.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Why did you ask Dorian for a Council position in MAliCE?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Ah, about time you asked.
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Some people call it giving up, but I will explain why not.  RTS is a name that I cherish very dearly.  However, it is just that -- a name.  I felt that we had already made our mark in history.  I decided that the most mature thing to


 do, and the easiest to boot, would be to see if Dorian was willing to work with me under the new MAliCE, rather than against me.  We both respect each other, and as I do not doubt Dorian's leadership, he does not doubt mine.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : It was said that the Council voted no - any idea why?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Yes, I was getting to that... here is why.  First reason for reluctance on both Dorian's part and the Council, I emphasized that I wanted to work *with* him.  Not as a Council member, but as a leader.  Or course this would have been 


phased in gradually once MAliCE had stabilized.  Dorian told me he would like working with me again.  But he decided to consult the Council, either because he was doubtful of his feelings on the matter and/or he was afraid there would be violent oppositio


n in MALiCE (to another leader, that is).  The Council, not surprisingly, voted no.  I do not know what kind of case Dorian presented to the Council, but there are many reasons for saying no.  And after all, these are only people that know me in passing.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Did any other groups prompt you to join?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Yes, a few people had approached me.  But I made it quite aware that I was not going to end RTS.  I would have done so earlier because, as I stated earlier, I have worked with some of the MALiCE members closely for over a year.  But 


after Dorian did not press his Council for some sort of arrangement, it was apparent to me that the situation in MALiCE was not one I wanted to be a part of. So I did an about-face and have since put in an incredible amount of time and effort into strengt


hening RTS, as have our excellent coordinators and members.  After all, where can a traditional scene leader go and be truly happy, beside his own group? :)
<P><B>INQ</B>      : Is there anything else you would like to add?
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : I would just like to close by restating what so many of us in the scene feel.  There are too many major trading groups.  Personally, I feel it has put the scene in disarray.  That is all.
<P><B>INQ</B>      : We thank thee for the interview - take care and good luck.
<BR><B>Ordnance</B> : Thank you, also.  For giving me this platform on which to speak, and providing this service to the scene.

<P><H3><CENTER>"How valuable are 800 numbers to boards?"</CENTER></H3>
<P>This question has been debated for quite a long time.  There are pro's and con's to having such a number setup for your board.  There are some Sys-Ops who do not understand the implications of having such a priviledge, which often leads to the demise o


f their board.
<P>The first example is that of a board that was in my area, The Grille.  This board was decent, to say the least, before it got an 800 number.  When the number arrived, the uploads doubled.  The ego level on that board also doubled with the increased pro


ductivity.  Many of the good users were turned away, but still many were willing to upload to a toll-free board.  However, the day came when it all went away.  After much prosperity, the 800 number was disconnected and then it began.  The fair-weather fri


ends/uploaders were never to be seen again.  The old couriers and local support that were turned away, during the 800 saga, were no where to be seen.  They were not needed then, so they would not help out now.  The board slowly made a come back, and proba


bly would have won back the respect it had before if things didn't suddenly go down hill.
<P>One day, a few weeks ago, the sysop got a bill in the mail.  The figures I have heard are between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars.  If you think about it, that makes sense.  Five nodes, often all busy, for more than a month.  It sure does add up.  The Sys-Op


, of course, refused to pay, claiming that he had no knowledge of the malicious fraud.  Then the FBI was supposedly informed, which
caused the Sys-Op to shut down everything.  All the hardware was sold, and the board was gone - just like that.
<P>The second example is Dimension XXX.  This robust 8 node board was very fast, and when it got its 800 number, things really took off.  However, many, many people got the number and the user base grew quite large.  People were always on uploading and le


eching.  Things got out of control, and everything and their mother was being uploaded.  Old warez, dupes, fakes, et cetera was  being allowed, and not nuked.  100+ disk CD-Rips were allowed to clog up the drives, which really deterred the good traders.  


To think that some lamer could upload a fake and get 150 megs credit, comparitive to your multiple legit releases, it was just aggrevating.  This sent a lot of the true couriers running.
<P>Basically, the thing to realize is that 800 numbers are obviously awesome, if you follow a few simple rules: don't let your ego blow-up, don't become a total asshole, don't spread your number to anyone and everyone, don't accept shit for uploads, and l


east but not last, never acknowledge to anyone that you are aware of the 800 number.  It can cost you many thousands of dollars.
<P>If you are lucky enough to get a 800 number setup to your board, then be sure to only give it out to a select few who can really help out, otherwise it will definately put you out of business, and possibly out of money.
<P>Thats all folks, I hope this will bring a few people down to reality.

<A NAME="Announce_Oyl_Speaks"></A><P><PRE>---=[ 7. Announcements - Oyl Patch Speaks Out ]=-------------------------------</PRE>
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I told Mikey tonight, very forcefully, that he can NOT lie any longer, and if he tries it, I will pull out my phone logs.  I said because you are still trying to figure out how to lie your way out of it. The time line is like this:
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : OK.  First, do you remember the day we were told that Mikey was in a coma?
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Yes..
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : OK.  That was on a thursday, after he was busted on a tuesday!
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : If you remember he said he had been robbed, right?
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Yes but that was before.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Well, he was NOT robbed.  He was busted on the Tuesday morning.  The Tuesday he said he was robbed!  Now, the time from there was like this.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I generally talk to MikeySoft voice at least every other day.. and have done so for many years.  I started trying to call him on the Tuesday evening he was busted.  All his data lines and his voice line were busy.  I knew the voice line


 was never busy because he has call waiting.  I tried until 2 am and it was still busy.  I tried Wednesday morning, still busy.  Wednesday afternoon his voice line was clear, but his data lines were still all busy.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I left a voice message on Wednesday, 2 or 3 in fact.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Thursday, his lawyer came on.  Yes, it was his lawyer.  Who has since said it was him.  He said Mikey is in a coma.  Mikey was NOT in a coma, was NOT in the hospital, but had indeed taken a bit too much seconal.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : OK.  Why would his lawyer lie?
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : He was only delivering the message mikey had told him to leave, because Mikey KNEW I would wonder what was going on and he did not want to tell us he was busted.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : BTW, this was the lawyer that comes on here under handle of Chester. Not his regular Clint Smith, but a member of the same firm.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : On the Thursday that we got the message on the IRC, I started calling hospitals.  I called every hospital in Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, et cetera.  Mikey was NOT in the hospital.  I called everyone that I knew in Phoenix that also knew mi


key, and no one had heard anything or seen him.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : On Friday morning, I called his lawyer, Clint Smith.  I said, "We got word that Mikey is in a coma.  I have called every hospital and Mikey is NOT in any of them.  What is up?"
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : His answer was, "No, Mikey is NOT in the hospital.  Mikey is at home, but Mikey is having some other problems now."
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : At that, I KNEW he had been busted.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : His lawyer said, "Call Mikey tonight, I am sure he will take your call."   I said OK.  In the meantime, I talked to someone else in Phoenix who HAD seen Mikey and been to his house.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : w00per?
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : They were the one who said Mikey has been busted.  I was there, and there was not a computer in the house, no floppies, nothing.  He said, "Nola, NO ONE would take every floppy, every cable, every tape, every thing, and leave all MIkey'


s expensive televisions and stereo equipment.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : BTW, It was NOT w00per who told me, it was someone different.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : At that point, Mikey knew his goose was cooked and started on the story of the robbery.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : On Friday evening, I did call Mikey, and he told me the same story of the coma, robbery, et cetera.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Why would Mikey not want us to know that he was busted?
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Ask Mikey, but there is LOTS MORE.   Believe me, and I will not even tell you all of it, but I will NOT go along with the lie any longer.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Anyway, Mikey got his monitor back on Friday.  The reason he got his monitor back was NOT because the police FOUND it, it is because of the law having to do with confiscation.  They can NOT legally keep any equiptment that does not have


 data that can be used as evidence. Anyway, when I learned he had gotten the monitor back, I KNEW beyond ANY doubt that he had been busted.  I asked him point blank on Saturday.  Mikey tell me the truth, were you busted.  He said, "Preposterous."
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I said, "Mikey, bullshit, you were NOT in the hospital because I called all of them and you were NOT there.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : He said, "Oh, it was because they were told not to give out info."
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Anyway, I then KNEW I had to warn a couple of seniors that Mikey had been busted so that he would not be accessing their sites.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I told exactly 3 people that I KNEW Mikey had been busted but had NO proof.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : We had changed the IP of our site in the meantime, and when mikey asked me for it on Friday evening, I told him I did not have it.  He got it from someone else, and the log shows he came on at about midnight and was on for 2 hours.  One


 of the Seniors that I had reported it to ALSO asked mikey if he had been busted.  Asked him on saturday and Mikey said preposterous!  Anyway, Mikey had managed to get the IP from someone else who had no idea he had been busted.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Isn't it possible that it was not Mikey?  IP spoofer/slirp?
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Nope, as a matter of fact, Mikey admitted it.  Even admitted who gave it to him.  I said Mikey that was INSANE.  He said, "Why, Novell was not going to check it."
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I said, "Mikey, bull, you know that you told me that indirect had sniffers on you."
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Anyway, as of Saturday or Sunday, Mikey's account was deleted from the site.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : On the following Tuesday, he called me at my office.  He said, "Nola, Clint just called me, he overheard the Novell guy and Gail Thackery down at the local police station talking, and the novell guy said he is going to be busting BBS in


 NY.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : He said, we MUST get hold of Pierre.  I was at work and never knew Pierre's last name.  So, naturally, I could NOT call him.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Mikey said he did not have his number because all his stuff had already been taken.  That was on Tuesday.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Toyman was warned.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Toyman was warned by me.  He is one of the people that I told.  After all, I go way back with toyman.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Anyway, I had already told toyman that Mikey was busted.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Toyman called him, and Mikey said NO WAY!
<BR><B>Devast</B> : ???????
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Toyman also asked Mikey point blank if he had been busted, Mikey said NO.  Anyway, it is true that Mikey came on the IRC on Tuesday.  He did get word to BBS's in NY that Novell is heading that way.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : But in a way, Mikey saved toyman.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Hell, no he did not.  He denied to Toyman that he had been busted. He told toyman that they were going to NY.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : But he warned Toyman that he could be busted.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Mikey did NOT tell Toyman that they were also coming his way until Thursday when Pie was busted.  Anyway, put that in your pipe; believe as you like, it is nothing to me.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Mikey has been a very close friend for 4-5 years.  He lied to me and continued to lie.  He is still trying to figure out HOW to make it plausible that he did NOT lie.  He says, "Well..  I guess I just do not keep up with time very well.



<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I have NO reason to trash Mikey.  I do have a reason to protect people who are also my friends.  I tried to warn the seniors, almost a week before Mikey admitted he was busted.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : All the time, Mikey was tr.  Mikey was still accessing the site.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I remember on what I think was Sunday, after Mikey had been busted on Tuesday.  Someone came into NTA-nokturnal, said Mikey had been busted.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : All the tennie-bopper wanna-be's starting kicking and yelling - How DARE you talk about Mikey God like that.  Hell, I did not even say anything then.  Was STILL only trying to warn the ones who REALLY had to know.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : OK.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Now, if ANYONE can disprove ONE WORD of ANY OF THIS.  I will absolutely KISS THIER SHITTY ASS.  And, believe me, I never kissed an ass and do NOT intend to start!
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Well, I can disprove him logging onto the site.  After this, I dunno if i should though.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Hell, Devast, I was on the damned phone with him.  He said he did, you want to believe him, well he admitted it.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Like I said, I don't think i should now.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Now got and give YOUR damned proof.  What ever proof you can muster from Mikey and want to believe, I really do NOT give a damn.  The truth IS the truth, and that is all I care about.  Mikey just said, "Well, the only thing that matters


 is NOT when I was busted, but that I warned Pie."  I said, "Hell Mikey, that is SHIT.  You lied and Lied and Lied.  NO ONE will ever believe you again!
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Now what do you have to say for Mikey God.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Nothing, we all lie, but this was a bit too much.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : What was a bit much?  Me trying to protect a few major people.  Hell!
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Devast, People have tried to tell you.  Not me.  I have NOT been talking about Mikey, but others DID try to tell you.  You do NOT want to believe it.  Sorry, does not matter.  Hide your head in the sand if you like.  That is YOUR proble


m.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : I wanna know the truth.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Devast, I am not even telling NOW all I really know.  Because I PROMISED Mikey I would not, and I will not.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I don't think you believe me now.  You want to believe Mikey, then go and believe Mikey.  Won't make it so, but you may do as you like.  I have never talked to you, and I certainly had NO reason to lie about a close friend of 4 years.  


A friend that I talked to every day.  A friend that I know better than ANY of you will EVER know him.  But, when that friend puts all my OTHER friends in peril by his lies and actions, I had to tell the truth.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Do you think Mikeysoft was/is helping novel/microsoft?
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Devast, I will NOT tell more than was absolutely neccessary to protect my friends.  There is NOTHING more that I have to tell about the incident.
<BR><B>Devast</B> : Whether he is helping novel/microsoft is important.  If he is, EVERYONE should know.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I can only say, if he lied about so much, why would you care?
<BR><B>Devast</B> : I wanna know just how far he has gone.  I wanna know the truth.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Leave it up to you to decide; if he has consitently lied, why do you care about the rest.  Tonight when mikey called me, he said, "I want you to support the story of how I called you on Tuesday, et cetera.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : I said sure, but don't asked me to lie about the rest.
<P><B>Oyl</B>    : Naturally, with that, he did NOT make the 3 way call.
<P><HR><P>So ends the conversation on Novemeber 4th, 1995.  Devast, among many people, was looking for the "truth" and Oyl Patch basically told him what really occurred.  Hopefully this awakens all those who are still have their heads in the ground.
<P>This ends the "Mikey" saga in INQ.  We will no longer cover any news regarding this issue unless Mike speaks to us.  After all, only so much can be said of this situation.  Conclusions have been made and some are still in the making, but this is not OJ


, so get on with you lives.

<A NAME="subscriptions"><P><CENTER><H3><B>**</B> Want to get Inquisition RIGHT after it's released? <B>**</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>I, Lurch, am now offering a service of "delivering" INQ straight to your mail box (E-mail box).  This service can be used if you have an account on an internet provider, AOL, Compuserve, or even a BBS which supports E-mail through FIDOnet or a similar 


service.  What does this mean?  Well, simply that the moment INQ is released, I will start up a program to mail a copy of INQ to all "subscribers."  There are two ways of recieving INQ magazine through e-mail. One is UUENCODED, and the other in PLAINTEXT.


  If you request a UUENCODED version a UUENCODED ZIP, DIZ and all, will be sent to you.  On the other hand, if you choose PLAINTEXT the magazine itself will be the contents of your message.  So, if you want to save a copy on your hard drive, request the U


UENCODED version.  If you do not, get a copy of UUDECODE for DOS from any shareware collection near you (be it a local board or CDROM.COM :) )  If, on the other hand, you wish to just recieve INQ to read it in the mailer, or wish
to get the text to convert it to a file later, request PLAINTEXT.  All you have to do to begin this service is leave me a message.  My E-mail address is currently <A HREF="mailto:lurch1@nile.intac.com">lurch1@nile.intac.com</A>, this may change soon, so i


f you want to request the E-mail service a few weeks from now, check my address in a later copy of INQ first. In your message simply tell me your regular e-mail address and that you want to subscribe.  Make sure to say which way you would like to recieve 


INQ (PLAINTEXT or UUENCODED).  If you wish for some of your friends to also recieve a copy in the mail, then also specify their addresses.  Then, unless you gave me the wrong address, you and those you listed will begin recieving INQ magazine in your e-ma


il shortly after each issue comes out.  No need to go and look for it, just sit back, relax, and read. :)
<P><B>NOTE</B>: If you wish to discontinue your subscription, or chnage the type of E-mail you get (PLAINTEXT/UUENCODED), just E-mail me with your request, and there should be no problems.
<P><CENTER><H3><B>**</B> Other Ways of INQUISITION distribution <B>**</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>For the past few weeks we were able to provide you with the most recent scene news and facts.  Inquisition has been a great success so far, yet we still see great room for improvment.  We are constantly striving to make every issue of the mag better th


en the last one.  So far we have succeeded in this goal, and hopefully this will continue and bring INQ to its best.  It is our intention to get as many people to read this mag as possible.  The circulation of this mag can become absolutely incredible due


 to the ability to spread information through the InterNet and send it all over the world.  We currently have five ways of distributing Inquisition.
<P>The most poular, by far, has been DCC offering.  The FTP trading also helps out a lot, and of course there is our WEB page on the net.  There is a little board couriering also. Finally the E-mail subscriptions will hopefully also speed up and expand th


e distribution of the mag.  With all of these we need some help from you, the readers.  If you currently have a home page somewhere on the web, we would really appreciate to have a link to the INQ page.  All we ask is that you <A HREF="mailto:tails@hooked


.net">notify us</A> that you have a link to us, and we will greatly appreciate it.  We strongly encourage you to spread the mag via FTP and DCC, and if you want a courier to upload a copy of the mag immediately after it is released to your site (must have


 at least 15 users), leave me a message and it can be aranged (Your site would not be listed anywhere, so there is no security problems). Also, if you currently run a board, you could greatly help out by putting INQ
on-line.  If you wish for a copy to be sent to your board, there should not be a problem in arranging a courier that would deliver INQ.
<P><CENTER><H3><B>**</B> A Final Note... <B>**</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>I am currently working on standardizing a format for the mag, and on making a DOS or WINDOWS viewer/browser to incorporate graphics and music and make your reading more pleasurable then just plain text.  For this, I need your suggestions and help, so p


lease e-mail me with what you think a viewer should be like and what it should include.  It would also be nice to hear your opinions about the OS the viewer should be for (Don't even bother suggesting OS/2 :) ).  If you have any suggestions on the layout 


of the mag, also feel free to comment.  Please spread the mag as far and wide as possible, and consider using the E-mail subscriptions.

<A NAME="closing"><P><PRE>---=[ 8. Closing ]=------------------------------------------------------------</PRE>
<P>Another issue is produced to the masses.  More interesting news to stir the scene, but this produces an unity within the scene which needs to occur every now and then.
<P>Hopefully you enjoyed this issue of INQUiSITION.  Look forward to part two of Mr.ZigZag's article over site security (hopefully his exams will end), Snakee's Interview, and other issues.
<P>If you want a subscription to INQ, E-Mail:  <A HREF="mailto:lurch1@intac.com">lurch1@intac.com</A>
<P>Yikes!  I put this issue in the middle of the morn here, and hopefully there are no MAJOR fuck-ups in it.  Anyhow - ENJOY!
<P>INQUiSITION will have weekly meetings on Wednesday's at 9p Central.
