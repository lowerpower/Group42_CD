<P>I just wanted to drop ya a line to tell ya what a great mag your running is. Let me start by saying I enjoyed reading it, it allowed me to find out what is new in the warez scene.  I come from a small town in Canada.  Half of the warez listed in the ma

<P><HR>
<P>Like a good habit, you read my weekly report again!  I am really sorry that I was a reason of INQ#6 delay because I have been really busy lately due to my participation in the scene.  Anyway I checked all passed stuff and made notes for myself.  Good r


eleasing week, some major titles happened and groups were active again.  We all had suprises as newbie groups with fine releases, like ROR succesfully beaten all big bands on long awaited Adobe Pagemaker 6.0. Also, we saw three different FINAL releases of


 QEMM 8.0.  I know your question.  What to get, PNC release, FINAL FINAL release or the ShrinkWarp release - the answer - get the FINAL FINAL release, it is really the final code.  Now lets travel among big the groups' releases for past 7 days from
11-07-95 till 11-13-95.
<P><CENTER><B>*</B> in alphabet order <B>*</B></CENTER>
<P><B>DOD</B> (Drink Or Die) - Brilliant week for DOD again.  13 very nice releases occurred, including some big, long-awaited titles, shown good store and internal pick up this time.  Now let me list all releases names here: it started with a nice word p


rocessor, Accent Express 2.0 for Win95 (supports 20 different languages), after it we saw couple of budget titles:  Family Tree Maker 3.0 (3 Disks) and Quicken Family Laywer (2 Disks), after that there were some two days silence and big bundle of software


 on weekend!  Four packages of another nice word processor, Describe Voyager 5.0, versions for Windows, Windows 95, OS/2 Warp and Add-on Dictionaries.  Small psychological proggy Decide Right for Windows (2 Disks) and FINAL CD-RIP of Micrographix ABC Snap


 Graphix Suite (28 2.8mb Disks).  Many new unreleased Micrographix programs were included there.  The week finished with PowerSoft PowerBuilder 4.03 for Windows NT (30 Disks) and a cute expensive astronomy product called Win*Star + some add-ons to it.  Ve


ry impressive work this time, DOD is awarded excellent points this time.
<P>Current Week Points:       <B>10/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:             <B>55/60</B>
<P><B>PNT</B> (Pantera) - It is not news that this group is doing better and better each week!  This week is not an exception!  They released 8 programs, but one game that they put out (Power Poker for Windows) was old dupe of Nexus from 1994. Others were


 fine; here they are:  Attachmate APPC Client 3.10 for Win (2 Disks), DbWeb 1.0 for Windows NT (6 Disks), MS System Management Server 1.1 (45 Disks) and several 1 Disk releases: Winframe Clients for Win 16 and 32 bit, DbWeb Service Pack 1 and Winframe for


 DOS. The group is releasing usually internal programming related programs. 
<P>Current Week Points:       <B>07/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:             <B>35/60</B>
<P><B>PNC</B> (PiNNaCLe) - Still a very sad picture here, from all of the group releases I noticed only three valid ones:  Multimedia WWW PC 3.0 for Windows (1 Disk), NCompass 1.21 for Win95 (3 Disks) and Netware Client 32 for Win95 Open Beta (7
Disks).  All others were dupes like Conner BackUp Exec 5.0a, Asymetrix Multimedia Toolbook 3.0 (very strange release, because I have 3.0 from late 1994 and it is on 10+ disks).  But, they still try to be on top with us and we need to respect this try.  Le


ts hope that they will dupe check their releases better.
<P>Current Week Points:       <B>04/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:             <B>21/60</B>
<P><B>PWA</B> (Pirates With Attitude) - Not the best week for PWA too, they started with two very huge CD-RIPs as Platinum Asset Manager SQL for NT (39 Disks and Mathlib + Calculus 1.2 (36 Disks).  All the other releases were small and we saw a nice ammou


nt of cracked sharewares.  Computer Based Training TCP/IP (4 Disks) and many 1 disks programs: Electroson Gear 3.23 for NT, GrabNet 2.0 cracked, Intermail Interecho 1.14, Interdrive 95 NFS Client Beta Cracked, Cubase Score 1.12 dongle cracked (not cracked


 properly), WinU 1.03 Security, and WBS Chart for Project 3.0.  Also there were some bigger utils like InterAp Internet Suite (4 Disks), Intergra Business App Builder 3.0 (7 Disks) and a huge beta 3 of Microstation CAD 95.  No well-known titles and a big 


lack of store pick-up.  Anyway, not too many betas as always and we all saw huge amount of work from the crackers. :)  Hope they will try harder next time.
<P>Current Week Points:       <B>08/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:             <B>54/60</B>
<P><B>RBS</B> (Rebels) - Guess this Euro team frozen with first snow. Absolutely nothing for last 7 days.  Hope to see something from them in next issue.
<P>Current Week Points:       <B>00/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:             <B>18/60</B>
<P>That's all I can tell you about past week.  December is coming and it reminds us that we will see shitload of fine utils soon.  New groups will hopefully work better and I will write something about them exactly.

<P><HR>
<P>Comdex finished and nothing happened. :)  We expected something serious to come from this great computer-related event and we're really dissapointed. Anyway this week shown us some rare brilliant utilities and let me show you some of them.
<P><CENTER><B>*</B> in alphabet order <B>*</B></CENTER>
<P><B>DOD</B> (Drink Or Die) - Impressive but not perfect.  It started with Microsoft Access 7.0 FINAL FLOPPY for Win95 (10 Disks); it was a long race with many scene groups DOD won it this time.  What else was released?  Of course, I want to mention a br


illiant and the best multimedia presentation package called Astound 2.1 for Win/Win95!  If you ever try that you will forget about MS PowerPoint forever. :)  I was very surprised with the quality and power of this program.  Also there were: IRMA for Inter


net 3.1 (c) Attachment (3 Disks) (very nice internet package), Yamaha Visual Arranger for Win (2 Disks) - to all musical fans and a bundle packages from stores: Counters Creator for Win95 (13 Disks), FloorPlan 3-D 2.0 for Win (2 Disks), Suretrack 1.5 for 


Windows (8 Disks) and Netscape Power Pack (7 Disks).  The whole week was quiet except MS Access and on the weekend, the group shown it's real ability on scene.  We expect more and more from them in future.
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>09/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>64/70</B>
<P><B>PNT</B> (Pantera) - Kinda slow week for those dudes.  Only three valid releases and one dupe occurred.  The releases are: IRMA TCP Suite for WFW/95 and NT (13 Disks), IRMA for Internet / Teleview 3.11 (5 Disks) (not sure if it's the same as DOD vers


ion) and Your Personal SAT Trainer (2 Disks).  The dupe happened in the last day of the week and was called Distinct TCP/IP (2 Disks).  Lame to compare with previous work and small points awarded coz of that. 
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>04/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>39/70</B>
<P><B>PNC</B> (PiNNaCLe) - Still bad quality.  Six valid releases and two dupes. Nothing really known or cool but some releases were OK.  Let me tell them all for the past 7 days: W3C Source Code Library (1 Disk), dupe of Scan Wizard for Win95 that appear


ed to be one for Win and old (2 Disks), UDIWWW 32-bit English (1 Disk), VR Scout VRML Viewer (2 Disks), Patter Maker Cross Stich for Windows (1 Disk), Quarterdeck's WebAuthor 2.0 (2 Disks), dupe of Portfolio 2.0 and Visual Reality Bonus CD (7 Disks).  The


 whole group is doing better this time, but still has shitload to fix and main problem is dupe checking!  Lets see what they will show us on next week.
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>05/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>26/70</B>
<P><B>PWA</B> (Pirates With Attitude) - Due of the lack of finals group turned into totally beta releasing.  There were 8 programs released and 6 (!!!) of them were betas, usually huge.  We saw pre-releases and not betas of: Microstation CAD, Imagineer Te


chnical (PWA is releasing betas for this programs with 1 week delay (grin)), Dr. Solomon's Antivirus for NT 7.51 beta, Lotus Notes 4.0 beta (only one really cool beta released), CA-Open Ingres 1.0 Beta and CA-Visual Telon 1.0 Beta.  Also 2 final compiled 


 programs: one is very big Visual Reality 2.0 CD-RIP (46 Disks) and AlertTrack (2 Disks).  Weak week, hopefully because all active PWA leaders spent their time on Comdex!  Lets hope they will not release as many betas as they did now. 
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>07/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>61/70</B>
<P>RBS (Rebels) - Still nothing from the Swedens this time!  If they will not start next week - I will replace them with ROR!!!
<P>Current Week Points:      <B>00/10</B>
<BR>Overall Score:            <B>18/70</B>
<P>So, the week of Comdex is over, and over with some results - such big titles like MS Access 7.0 and WinFax Pro for Win95 are released!  The other programs were less popular but definite quality.  Only one shortcoming this time - less overall group acti

<P><B>ROR</B>, 1.7 megs.  I know I've played these two tables before.  Includes the "rocket" table and the "gravyard" table (Outer space/Scary themes).  It's the outdated pinball type boards of old times.  Nothing special, and to add to it, the Graveyard 


pinball's sound was fucked up.  Decent small pinball if that's what you're looking for.  Oh, did I forgot to mention 2 letters? SW!

<P><B>Tdujam</B>, 8 disks.  Class, can we say "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome"?  That's exactly what you'll get after playing this one for more than 15 minutes.  You are a ship, you roam the little playing area and shoot at asteroids. Speaking of asteroids, thats


 exactly what this game is like, except in VGA & for win. Just have fun banging away at the shift key and blowing up shit until sumtin good comes out.  However 8 disks for this sucker is a bit too much.

<P><B>Tdujam</B> (surprise surprise a floppy), 3 disks.  If you can get the it out of your mind that it's a kiddie game, you might be able to find it some- what enjoyable.  It's practically a lot like the Lion King game release about a year ago.  Your tha

<P><B>RPC</B>, 8 disks.  Yes it works, but it's just some beta or homemade shit certainly not final release.  It looks homemade, or like a beta.  It has no sound and the graphics fuck up.  Although if it had sound, and worked 100% it would be decent.  Sin

<P>(Better late then never).  It seems that all too many games are moving away from the fast action arcade fun to the more sophisticated number playing games.  But I'm happy to report that this is not one of them.  The game is still fun, flows nicely, and


 has great action.  And according to the menu, it will have modem play.  Now if only they would let ME define my keys. Anyhow, the game looks to be a great hit, however it may be a little to big for it to be ripped and still enjoyed.

it has it's entire lifetime.  The game is your doom catacomb atmosphere, with the RPG style fighting and keeping of weapons. You can't complain about the details and graphics in this one, but for 35 disks it damn well better have good graphics.  It's stil

<P><DT>Fighter Duel - Avalon Blue
<P><DD>Years ago, Fighter Duel made it's debut on the Amiga platform.  In terms of flight mechanics and individual plane's performance, it was one of the most advanced simulators of it's day.  It's biggest drawback at that time was that it's 16 color poly


gon graphics and completely crude ground obstacles.  One I remember in particular was a gigantic white Stonehenge - like arch smack dab in the middle of the battlefield.  It didn't look too hot but the World War II era planes sure performed historically c


orrect.   Corkscrewing into the ground over and over upon takeoff was my major frustration as I learned to handle these old-time fighters.
<P><DD>In this release for the PC, the utterly realistic flight model is the only thing carried over from the original Amiga release.  The blocky surreal landscape has been replaced by gorgeous 256 color SVGA graphics.  The instrument panels are particula


rly striking.  You can fly any of thirteen different prop-driven fighters including such storied planes as the Spitfire, Hellcat, Mustang, Corsair, and Me-109.  You fly your plane against up to eight computer controlled opponents, also flying planes of yo


ur choosing.
<P><DD>There are no real missions in Fighter Duel but you can shoose to start in any of a number of scenarios, such as a catapult launch from the deck of the U.S.S. Lexington or a surprise attack, which has you swooping down on your enemies in a high-spee


d dive from their blind spot.
<P><DD>This is still no walk in the park as far as flight simulators go.  Just trying to get the plane in the air and level can bring you to tears.  It pays to go to the library and get a book on these old warbirds, to learn their individual idiosyncrasie


s.  If you're looking for a realistic World War II flight sim though, look no further than Fighter Duel.
<A NAME="Interview_Anon_Rebuttle"></A><P><PRE>---=[ 4. Interview - Anonymous - Rebuttle ]------------------------------------</PRE>
<P><B>INQ</B>       : Why do you feel RTS broke up?
<BR><B>Incognito</B> : I felt RTS broke up due to the lack of commitment in the whole Team.  Certain areas were more commited than others, but if Seniors don't show much commitment than it doesn't exactly set a good example for the rest of the team, hence


 this started in my own opinion the breakup of RTS
<P><B>INQ</B>       : Do you think Dorian tried to break RTS up?
<BR><B>Incognito</B> : No, I did not feel Dorian tried to break up RTS, as a courier of RTS, I got the impression he was the one trying to rebuild RTS, afterall he was taking the reigns of RTS, while Ordnance was away for quite a while.  And, for a person


 to do that requires great strength.  If I hadn't been for Dorian putting time and effort into RTS, RTS would have fell apart even earlier.
<P><B>INQ</B>       : So he was not getting help from the other council members?
<BR><B>Incognito</B> : The only council member I felt that was trying to help Dorian co-ordinate on the Net side was Aslan, but it took me 4 weeks as a courier getting in; like Aslan approved of me, but another council member needed approval from Dorian e


ven though Aslan told me Dorian approved of me.  So from the outset it looked like council had problems anyways.
<P><B>INQ</B>       : Why do you think Dorian decided to quit and reform MAliCE?
<BR><B>Incognito</B> : I believed Dorian quit, because he was getting no support from anyone at all.  The fact that Ordnance as a Senior was not around certainly did not help him.  In terms of motivation, however I believed the final straw was when Ordnan


ce returned and decided to implement policies without consultation with Dorian at all.  After that, I think Dorian had enough, he gave his time and effort to RTS, and got Zippo back, as a courier.  I believed he was the main driving force for RTS.
<P><B>INQ</B>       : How successful do you think RTS will be now?
<BR><B>Incognito</B> : RTS, I think they can make a come back but I don't think they can be as strong as what they were in their haydays.  But, if the same beaucratic bullshit appears in RTS, then I believe there is no hope as a competitive couriering for


ce.  Well the answer to that is to look around on the boards and the major sites.  MAliCE in my opinion has done alot more in 6 weeks than RTS has done in 4 months.  I am a courier in MAliCE and I think the spirit in MAliCE is more relaxed; the Council an


d the President always talk.  And, things actually get done.  For example, the MAliCE NFO is updated weekly if not daily.  I feel as a group, MAliCE, is more co-ordinated.
<P><B>INQ</B>       : Allegedly Dorian was trying to reform MAliCE back in the summer, any truth to this?
<BR><B>Incognito</B> : Yes that was true.  Dorian was trying to reform MAliCE back then because, although I dont know for sure, RTS was beginning to have internal problems from there.  Like council members bickering and things getting disorganized.
<P><B>INQ</B>       : So was Dorian trying to break up RTS so he could reform Malice?
<BR><B>Incognito</B> : No, I dont think that was in his heart, I think he was trying to reform Malice by himself and probably other members of RTS, who were getting pissed at the disorganization, but that was what I was told, by someone higher up.

<P><CENTER>"Rebuttle - Busts"</CENTER>
<P>Okee dokee, the first thing to point out, in your interview with W00per, he attempted to explain some stuff on a bond issue and what happened with that.
<P>Any time a company files a civil suit and wants to seize equipment, they are required by law to file a bond of 1.5 times the estimated value of the equipment seized.  In order to cover potential damages that happen durring the seized period of time unt


il the case is ended or settled.
<P>They had to file a $150,000 bond when they got the search and seizure order for my board.
<P>As for your things to "help" out in case someone gets busted.
<P>You said, "Move all pirated material into your server.  They legally cannot keep any equipment that does not contain pirated material."
<P>To be perfectly concise, that's complete bullshit.  If it were a criminal case that was going on, then there is a lot of truth to that, and many other things that make it difficult on behalf of the people who seized things and much nicer for those who 


were busted.  For a civil case, which is ALL that is being filed lately, there is no such case law, and no precedents that apply at all, it's entirely new ground, and they can seize basically whatever the hell they want to as long as it's vaguely connecte


d in some way.  Plugged in counts, network counts more.
<P>My system was ran in a manner that would go along with what you're trying to tell people to do.  It was a novell system where everything was on the server. The board was run by 9 diskless workstations with USR modems, and 2 USR CommServers (also diskle


ss).  All of it was seized because the civil case was filed along the grounds of "contributing to" copyright infringement.  That means that I (or others as cases are filed) were "providing the means" that allowed people to infringe on their copyrights.  T


hat helps give them the ability to seize anything and everything that assists in providing those means.  Which is the entire network, the modems, the diskless stations, etc. Even UPSs and surge bars.
<P>Also, you tell people to research copyright laws in their own states.  This has no bearing on anything at all.  The cases that are filed are filed in federal court, citing federal copyright statutes.  These take all precedence over any state or local l


aws, so knowing what your state says won't make a bit of difference.
<P>Anyway, just wanted to point those things out.  They way it's all going is that MS/Novell and others aren't intelligently pursuing pirates at all. They really don't have the foggiest fucking clue on how the system works or who does what.  They attack b


oards based on someone calling in to their piracy hotlines and supplying a login account, and they begin research from there.
<P>Someone had supplied them a login to my system and that's where it started. I researched as best I could all the cases ever filed by them previous to my bust, and found the same procedures were followed.  It's not an "intelligent" thing on their part, 


but a lucky one.  Just takes advantage of how upset someone is with anyone's BBS and what kinda access they have.

<P><CENTER>"Net Ethics"</CENTER>
<P>Hello, this is Darwin, your friendly neighborhood net courier, coming to you live and direct.  I've been noticing a lot of bullshit in the net scene lately, and I'd like to toss out some ideas and address some issues that I think need adressing.  The n


et scene is the future; people and standards have to be maintained.  The best boards are what the best FTP sites will have to become; a place where the best and most capable hang with intense competition. Notice I don't say friendly competition, because i


t isn't always.  I'd like it to be, but people have egos.  So, the same bullshit happens over and over again.  Whatever, just let your reputation and your uploads stand as an indication of your skills.  There's no need to talk trash, and the worst thing i


n the world is when someone proves your trash talking wrong.
<P>I have to say my peace about the way that things are released and traded on the net today.  If you were a BBS trader, would you upload disks 1, 2, 10-16 and 25 to a board?  Of course you wouldn't.  So, why the hell do people do it on sites?  I don't th


ink that the competition is to get individual disks up, people; it's to up a *complete*, *tradable* release. Look at Screamer, look at Lemmings Chronicals, I Have No Mouth, et cetara.  I try to make a point not to up a release until I have *all* of the di


sks. People start upping the 4 out of twenty disks they have, and those 4 disks get spread everywhere.  Do you know how much time I've wasted checking sites every few hours for more disks?  What is happening here?  How are the releases getting spread from


 the release groups?
<P>The way I would envision releases to the net is basically the way that releases to BBS's work now.  The release gets upped to the release group's WHQ FTP site.  The group's net traders grab the release and send it to the sites they're on once it is com


plete there.  After all, is there competition between two traders in the same group?  There shouldn't be.  The objective is to get the full release traded as quickly as possible.  From experience, I know that this isn't happening, and it looks bad for *ev


eryone who ups an incomplete*. I mean, who wants to see five different upload names for one release?  That's just silly.  How do you divide the creds, how do you make a name for yourself? I think it's a mess.  This brings me to my next point : credits for


 uploads.
<P>Many sites now-a-days have Top-Up lists or logfiles of who uploads and downloads.  Now, I don't have any problem at all with these, but they don't help you see who has been uploading that day or week.  My personal solution to this is to let people see 


who won on a given release on a given site by putting the name of the courier on the end of the directory.  I mean, seriously, people, what the hell is the problem with it?  It's really hard to ignore that a trader has gotten every release on a given day 


or whatever other feat of trading that occurs if the name is all over that days' listing.  In this way, a trader can make a name for himself on a given site or in a group of sites.  It's not like there are a specific group of sites, like the top ten board


s or whatever.  A person makes himself the best on whatever site they choose, and they should be able to have their name known.
<P>After all, what is this scene about if it's not competition?  Is it about how useful the files are?  How many traders used Netscape Plus Pack or played The Hive?  Not too many, especially those who dial-in to a shell account.  Who wants to download 30 


disks at 28.8k?  Not most people, especially if the game may very well suck?  Most of all, we must be try to have *fun*.  That's why we do this, people, because it's amusing and it passes the time in a way we like.  If it's not fun, we should hang it up. 


 I personally don't enjoy rag wars, group fights, incompletes, dupes, trash talking, et cetera.  I don't have fun when this shit is going on, and I want
to stop it.  If someone has a problem with me, then talk to me about it.  I'm a reasonable guy, if you're reasonable to me.  I think that this is true of most of the people who have been with this scene as long as I have, and I think it's a damn shame tha


t people can ruin a fun thing for some cruel selfish kicks.

<P>The following exchange is the result of e-mail exchange between one CHRIS CARTER @iia2.org (supposedly either the offices of SPA or an account used by SPA) and the sysadmin of a local provider in an eastern state.  Not only is Mr. Carter not happy that


 the SysAdmin will NOT violate the privacy laws, he resorts to threats and intimidation in an attempt to coerce the SysAdmin into becoming a co-conspirator in his dirty work.  According to Mr. Carter, the OTHER 200 administrators were more co-operative.  


Please consider, if your SysAdmin is one of the 200 which Mr. Carter claims are co-operative, your every word and thought may be open to Mr. Carter's prying eye. 
<P>Before this crackpot's tactics succeed in violating the private mail and business of each and every person who has ever used a computer or ever been on the internet in any manner, perhaps the internet community would do well to e-mail Mr. Carter and le


t him know your views.  It should be sufficient to simply return this mail to Mr. Carter with the following thought to Mr. Carter at:

<P>Let your voice be heard before Mr. Carter determines he has the right to read your e-mail also.
<P>Should you really feel incensed about this episode which really does amount to a private employee of the SPA trying FORCE someone else into the illegal act of violating every privacy law we hold dear, you might also e-mail a copy to your own state and 


federal elected officials.  Only if we make it known to elected officials how we, the American public, view the creeping intrusion into our privacy, will we be able to make a contribution to a future free of this type of intrusion.

<B>Re</B>: Your violation of privacy laws
<P>Mr. Carter, while your personal views regarding software piracy may be deemed by some to have merit, the citizens of the United States of America are not willing to dump our Constitution and Bill of Rights on the trash heap of history for the benefit o


f the SPA or ANY software developer.  To the contrary we feel your gestapo tactics are far more sinister and if you persist, the American public (to say nothing of those in the local, state and federal government who are sworn to uphold the law) may deem 


that YOU Sir are a real threat to our way of life and decide that in order to send our message loud and clear, we will no longer support ANY software company who is found to support your methods of invasion of privacy.
<HR>
<P>Personal Note From This Writer:
<P>Mr. Carter, I was influential in the purchase of at least $500,000 worth of software for my company in the past year alone.  Each and every product used by my company is properly licensed and I also purchase each and every product which I use on my per


sonal computer.  However, like many others, I do indeed download and review many "pirated" copies.  Not because I wish to bankrupt the developers by not paying for the product, but because I do not wish to have my company bankrupted by hugh investments in


to products that do not work as intended.  Tomorrow I will be spending my company's money to travel to Comdex to view the offerings of your employers.  However, I do think that I shall be VERY reluctant to purchase any more product than is ABSOLUTELY esse


ntial.  We can do very well with what we have already bought and paid for.  Until the developers decide they have better things to do with their money than promote your illegal acts, I will continue to refrain from supporting them.

I do not have a lack of attention in any matter concerning illegal activity,
but I simply do not jump through hoops because some irrate IRC user e-mails
me.  If I was to look through ANY user's files on our system, that would be
illegal.  We here at XXXXXXX are strongly against software piracy, but we
are also *STRONGLY* against invasion of privacy.

Your opinions concerning violating the privacy of our users in regards to

regards to the law, and do not permit illegal activity of any sort...including
the violation of the privacy of our users.

Well Mr. Carter, perhaps your technical understanding of

especially on an insecure platform such as TCP/IP.  I suggest you right
now contact the local (name of city) police department.  I will tell them the

VIOLATE THE PRIVACY OF OUR USERS WITHOUT A COURT ORDER.

Furthermore, I consider your e-mail of a threatening and harrassing nature.
If you contact me again in any form, e-mail, phone, or in person; I will file

I think it is wonderful that you are tired of illegal activity.  I do not
believe IRC logs to be evidence, since they can be altered easily.  Did you
DCC a copy of this software from him to verify that it was illegitimate?
If you did then you are just as guilty as he is, if you didn't then you
don't know that it was a real copy.  How do I know that you are not
just unhappy with a user here and have not forged the logs?

I do not have a lack of attention in any matter concerning illegal activity,
but I simply do not jump through hoops because some irrate IRC user e-mails
me.  If I was to look through ANY user's files on our system, that would be
illegal.  We here at OPENIX are strongly against software piracy, but we
are also *STRONGLY* against invasion of privacy.

Your opinions concerning violating the privacy of our users in regards to
administration policies are not welcome.  We follow existing legislation in
regards to the law, and do not permit illegal activity of any sort...including
the violation of the privacy of our users.

SO IN CONCLUSION:  I AM NOT SEARCHING THROUGH USERS FILES OR COOPERATING WITH
ANYONE WANTING TO GO AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PRIVACY COMMUNICATION ACT OF 1986
WITHOUT A COURT ORDER.

Again, thank you for your concern,

        The next time I download pirated software from "xxx" who
frequents the IRC warez channels, I will personally contact the (Name of City),
(Name of State) police authorities.  They will handle the problem.  I am
getting very tiresome of the amount of copyrighted software that is being
exchanged online IRC.

        It is very interesting to note your lack of action in this
matter.  I've talked with over 200 administrators in the past few months,
all of which have taken a strong standing against software piracy.

        It is also interesting to note that your business does not have a
user contract which permits you to do standard administrative
investigations against illegal activity.  If a court order is what you
need, then I will contact the (Name of State) police and have them contact you.

<P><B>Devast</B>    : Oyl is here, what do you want me to ask her?
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : Umm...  Stuff.
<P><B>Devast</B>    : Like?
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : Oh...  Whatever tunes you fork.
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : Fill in the blanks
<P><B>Oyl Patch</B> : Evening.
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : Ah
<P><B>Devast</B>    : Fill in the blanks.  :)
<P><B>Oyl Patch</B> : Mikey, you mean MOI?
<P><B>Oyl Patch</B> : Well, basically, not much to fill in.  Mikey got busted as we all know.  For personal sufficient reasons, Mikey did not think it was essential that he broadcast it.
<P><B>Devast</B>    : Uh-uh.
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : And it had nothing to do with Scene stuff.
<P><B>Oyl Patch</B> : Anyway, Mikey and I had had a LONG discussion about the events. Mikey knows that I was concerned about certain security issues, and thought it was absolutely essential that a few people knew of the bust.  Naturally, Mikey did not rea


lly want to let it all hang out, and based on his attorney's advice, he tried to keep it quieter.  Whole truth and nothing but the truth is that the bust was a bit earlier than Mikey had said.
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : Yup
<P><B>Oyl Patch</B> : No real biggy and many have said, they would not want it broadcast either.  And he was also following his attorney's advice.
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : Yup!
<P><B>Devast</B>    : OK.
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : That's true too!
<P><B>Oyl Patch</B> : Mikey and I have been friends for MANY MANY years, and because we have been so close, there was no way he could hide it from me.
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : This is also true.
<P><B>Oyl Patch</B> : So turns out, it was me, who has been as close to him as any, was the one who actually blew the HORN, not a wee whistle but a DAMNED BULL HORN!  Not a first, but again because of my concerns for security.  I did let a couple of senio


rs know the facts.
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : This is also true.
<P><B>Oyl Patch</B> : Finally, I just told Mikey, cut the bull shit, lets get rid of the issue, admit it was a bit earlier than alledged and forget it.
<BR><B>MikeySoft</B> : I'm asking everyone to please understand that the few days that we are talking about, I never ever compromised anyone.
<P>Basically this is the final epidsode.  We meant to put this out much earlier since it is old news.  Anyhow - good luck to Mikey and his pursuits in the future.

<P>Well boys and girls, I don't know whether I should be pleased or sorry to say that there have only been about 60 subscriptions to the E-Mail service. For me, that is plenty to keep the service up.  And 60 may seem like a lot of people, but compared to 


the total amount of readers of this mag, it ain't much.  Then again, if there are only 60 readers of the mag (which I don't THINK is true), then we must be really doing a sorry ass job.
<P>The subscriptions that we did get, however, were very pleasing.  Seems like the INQ is really making it all the way around the world.  There are subscriptions from Canada, Italy, numerous spots in the US, Finland, Russia, Japan, and a few other countri

<P><B>NOTE</B>!  I collected all the URLs that people sent me in a file. Unfortunately, due to Mr. Gates that file was lost.  (The HD got full, and apparently something in Win95 did something it wasn't supposed to.  So the file is gone).  <B>Please re-mai

<BR><B>Tsunami</B>  : Well, let him try.  None of the guys doing this are in the scene much. :)  But of course, any INQ guys who'd like to join are welcomed.  That is, once we get the first issue out, so people can read it.

<P><B>Raptor</B>   :  Not to be an asshole, but when you openly admit that you are going to steal guys from INQ - then you basically start a little battle - I am sure Marlenus is logging this and I can pass it to everyone to enjoy the ethics of the new ma
