<br>I now shall restrict your license. Tell you what you can do with this
material. Tell you how you can use it. Tell you you can't take it apart.</p>

<p> I shall now explain how my lawyers can beat up your lawyers. I will
now politely threaten you if you don't agree to everything I want, no matter
how obtuse the demands.</p>

<p> If you don't agree to these demands you may try to attempt to get a
refund from a clueless computer salesman.</p>

<p> These web pages have no guarantee. If you break your leg, kill yourself,
cause mental damage in yourself or others, it's not my fault.</p>

<p> No matter what chemicals you may find on these pages, no matter <i>how</i>
infected the bloody needle on the doorway to these pages, you may not sue.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Seriously though. These are ideas. The themes presented here have been
in many forms presented before. I am flattered if your are impressed with
the form my words take.</p>

<p> If you wish to point to my web page, feel free, and mail me your web
page address.</p>

<p> If you wish to use any of this for print publication, I will most likely
agree, and also email me.</p>

<p> If you wish to pay me money, feel free to email me with your needs.</p>
