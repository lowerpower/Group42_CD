Kai, of Kai's power, tools on piracy - excerpted from portion of help file, KPT 3.0
<P>
We do have quite the piracy going of course, sometimes it feels like all of entire countries are quite well served by a handful of copies, thank you very much...  Well, you might know my angle on this topic, its a very simple line:
No one can possibly buy everything there is just to check it out once...and so in that sense its ok if you got it from Uncle Fred to have a peek.  But, the 'ethics' angle for me is:  "If you use it more than once a week, or if you do any kind of professional project with it, then by all means, invest in your tools and allow the toolmakers to make them better for you"

and that seemed eminently reasonable and sensible and fair.
I have a lot of letters from folks that agreed and KPT was the first thing they ever paid for...  ; )
