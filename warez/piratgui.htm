</PRE>
   Is the author of  the above message a  true pirate ? Since  the beginning of
time there  has been  an implicit code of  etiquette governing  the actions  of
software pirates, but as many of you may have noticed as of late, that code has
been knocked around a bit. Although  it's not difficult to differentiate a true
pirate from one  of these poor  imitations, I believe  that, with the number of
true  pirates  decreasing  at  such  an  alarming rate, this code should be set
straight. After all, although "Johnny" is admittedly a moron,it's not his fault
that he never received proper guidance. <P>
    One of  the first  and foremost  rules of  piracy:
 <P>                      REAL PIRATES ARE OVER 15 YEARS OLD!
 <P>Exceptions to this rule are extremely rare at best.
 <P>    Corollary: You never have to wonder who breeded Mickey Mouse with a 2600 hz
tone to produce a real pirate's voice.
 <P>

<H3>ALIASES</H3>    Real pirates  are more  imaginative than  to use the word  "copy" in  their
alias.
 <P>    Corollary: Real pirates aren't named  "Mr. Copy" because real pirates don't
brag about cracking Dung Beetles.
 <P>    The word "crack" (or  "krack") is found nowhere  in a real pirate's name...
unless he really knows how to.
 <P>    Real pirates' aliases don't sound as if they were extracted from the lyrics
of an Ozzy Ozbourne song (ie. Provisioner of Satan, Black Avenger,Dark Phantom,
etc).
 <P>    Real pirates don't name themselves after heavy metal groups.
 <P>    Real pirates,if named after some aspect of pirate legend (i.e. Jolly Roger,
Captain Hook, Eye Patch, etc.) don't say, "Avast ye scurvy dogs," or anything of
the like.
 <P>    Real  pirates'  names  aren't  parodies  of  other  reputable pirates (i.e.
Resident of Lavender Bag, Mr. Pac Man, Franklin Bandit, etc.).
 <P>    Real  pirates  don't  name  themselves  after  alcoholic beverages (ie. Jack
Daniels, Harvey Wallbanger,  Jim Beam, etc),  especially when they've  never had
one.
 <P>    Real pirates spell their aliases correctly (unlike "The Poenix").
 <P>    Real pirates  aren't named  Sam Houston,  Sir Spanky,  The Gamemaster,  Lord
Fagen, (insert your own losers here), or Mr. Copy.
 <P>
<H3>WARES</H3>
    Real pirates  would never  think of  deleting "Sabotage".  It's too much fun
imagining those little men are actually Sir Knight.
 <P>    Real pirates play "Bilestoad".
 <P>    Real pirates have long  since deleted "Sneakers", "E.T.",  "Alien Munchies",
"Bug Battle", "Snack  Attack", and everything  from SSI, Avalon  Hill, and Scott
Adams.
 <P>    Real pirates upload. They  realize that leeching is  the #2 sin (behind,  of
course, being 13 years old).
 <P>    Real pirates realize that Penguin aren't really "The Graphics People".
 <P>    Real pirates  feel guilty  when pirating  Beagle Brothers.  Of course,  that
never stops them.
 <P>    Real pirates don't believe the morons  who say they have Ultima IV  and Pole
Position.
 <P>    Corollary: Real pirates realize that there is a difference between Formula I
Racer and Pole Position.


<H3>BOARDS</H3>
    Real pirates aren't the fifth to post the same "I have..." message.
 <P>    Corrolary: Real  pirates don't  post "I  have..." messages  when they really
don't have.
 <P>
    Real pirates don't download programs from public AE's and then post "I  know
it's old, but I have...too" messages on pirate boards.
 <P>    Real pirates don't post their high scores.
 <P>    Corollary: Real pirates don't keep score.
 <P>    Real pirates don't say "K-K00L", "K-AWESOME", "X10DER", "L8R0N", or anything
of the sort.
 <P>    Real  pirates  know  the  difference  between  "f"  and "ph" (i.e. "philes",
"phuck", "fone", etc.).
 <P>    Real pirates  don't waste  everyone's time  backspacing over  their alias 50
times.
 <P>    Real pirates never use text graphics in their messages.
 <P>    Real pirates don't care about The Curse BBS's "K-K00L M0DS".
 <P>    Real pirates don't search for new ways to spell "WARES".
 <P>    Real pirates don't use the last 5 lines of their messages bragging about the
8 meaningless organizations that they belong to.
 <P>    Corollary: Real pirates don't belong to SWAPP, DOS/NPG, or NASCOMP.
 <P>    Real  pirates  who  are  GBBS  Sysops  are  proud  to  have stolen from Greg
Schaefer.
 <P>    Real pirates are satisfied with one exclamation point.
 <P>    Real pirates don't call Dial-Your-Match.
 <P>    Real  pirates  never  get  into  "bitch  wars"  unless,  of course, they are
grinding some 13 year old TI user into the dust.
 <P>

<H3>TRANSFERS</H3>
    Real pirates don't DFX.
 <P>    Real pirates  no longer  buy Micromodem  II's, SSM  modemcards, or Networker
modems.
 <P>    Corollary: Real pirates buy Apple Cats.
 <P>    Corollary to the Corollary: Real pirates accept the reality that 300 baud is
dead.
 <P>    Real pirates aren't around to trade on Friday or Saturday nights.
 <P>    Corollary: Real pirates haven't watched Love Boat since they were 13.
 <P>    Real pirates type "BRUN AE" without the spacebar in between.
 <P>    Real pirates can get Diskfer/Catsend to work right the first time.


<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
    That's it...for now. Since  losers invent new ways  to be losers every  day,
expect a "Real Pirate's Guide, Volume 2" very soon.
 <P>    If any of you were terribly  offended by anything in this file,  that's your
clue to retire from the pirate world. After all, real pirates don't get offended
by things written in textfiles.
 <P>    Thanks  to  the  following  for  their  contributions  to  this  file:  Otto
Shineflug, Ctrl Reset, Bit O'Nasty, Lord Chaos, Niloniel I, and whatever Con Man
calls himself out of state.
