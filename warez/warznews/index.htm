Welcome to The Week in Warez Newsletter. WWN is a weekly newsletter for
the Warez scene! The WWN exists because unlike the Music and Demo scene,
the Warez scene had no newsletter or disk mag put out on a regular basis.
WWN each week will have a warez report that will provide info on every
ware released each day.  We will also have other cool things like articles,
group news, and interviews.
