<P>Welcome to The Week in Warez Newsletter. WWN is a weekly newsletter for the Warez scene! I decided to start WWN because unlike the Music and Demo scene, the Warez scene had no newsletter or disk mag put out on a regular basis. WWN each week will have a
 warez report that will provide info on every ware released each day.  We will also have other cool things like articles, group news, and interviews. This week along with the Weekly Warez Report,  We have an interview with Jimmy Jamez, Pres. of DoD, and a
n articles by both MikeySoft and TwH. Enjoy!   
       
<P><CENTER>We want you to write in with articles and comments!!</CENTER>

<P>Well, here we are! Week in Warez Mag #2!  I have heard a lot of good comments about this mag. I am glad that this warez report is exactly what some people  have been looking for in a long time.  I hope that this weeks  report from  Sunday 07/30/95  -  
Friday 08/04/95 will be very informative. Enjoy!

<P>*NOTE* This warez report consists of ONLY the warez that have made it to the internet. There are still releases out there that havn't made it.  If you run a group  that releases on BBS's and you  would like  to see your  release on  this listing, leave
  email  to  <A HREF="mailto:an336572@anon.penet.fi">an336572@anon.penet.fi</A> with  your  groups release with all the info necessary..

<CENTER>=NTA=   Lead Senior   The Nokturnal Trading Alliance</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>=BBS=   Sysop Admin   The Final Frontier BBS</CENTER><BR>
<P>Well yones Mikey here with words of profound revelations..
<P>With the =NTA= rollout of Windows 95 complete, (verified absolutely gold) and another experence with MS under my belt, (which I'd say clearly ranks up there with cynide poisoning), it's important for all of us to reflect on our contribution or how we f
it into the overall picture.  The direction we need to go, how we operate, the very issue of being able to do what we  wish to do, and how clearly, now depends on how we look at ourselves in terms of the industry and how we contribute.  If our community w
ishes to survive 
  it is time to give thought to these important issues.  My thoughts are shared by many of us who have been around for awhile, (grin) so understand I'm not   speaking for RiSc or NTA here, just as a pioneer member of the scene,  and one who has grown mayb
e a bit possesive of it terms of any HARM coming to one of my own or to one of its family members.
<P><STRONG>People We Are A Force To Be Contended With!</STRONG>
<P>The software venders, the hardware venders, Public Relations (i.e InfoWorld), Distribution, Mail Order... yes WE effect it greatly as a community.  If you don't think so, you're wrong..... I don't speak of the issues of Pirate Software either, I'm talk
ing that, as a group, we have a great impact on SALES, Marketing strategies, reviews of products, release of products, etc.  To not think so or consider its impact now is ridiculous.  After some thought, I would have to say our community can best be descr
ibed as being closely compared to the VESA Comm.  (You know VESA = Video Electonics Standards Ass.) When it   first got going, VESA first formed on Genie and looked much like we do, a bunch of enthusiasts who find pleasure & fun out of just sharing ideas 
with others, a common interest. All of us come together in a strickly enforced NON-PROFIT way for the sole purpose of 'Contributing to the Industry' that we all consider ourselves a part of.  Surely it's obvious that the very roots of some products can be
 traced back to us in terms of the creation, in some cases.  BBS owners know that it's sure as hell not the money that motivates keeping our boards up dispite the cost of time/effort/money, not to mention risk.
<P> There just is something inherently wrong when we suffer losses of people and equipment everytime a vender flexes its corporate muscle because of either political correctness or convenience of agenda.  The LOSSES of expertise and of  talent effectively
 seems to be just unacceptable to me.  The reward, rather than the respect and acknowlegment of the real contribution made, comes with indiscrimate use of absurd and outdated laws.  The very self contradictory nature of what we do is being used and abused
 as a issue of convenience. It must change or we must try to change it, the damage factor is just too high, people.  To get a bit clearer, a "Reason To Be" must be spelled out or we face the inevitable.   
<P>Here is an Example:
<P>Windows 95! and  Windows 3.x  are  products  that  clearly have a tremedous impact on just about every person, (whether you like it or not), we have to look at the development cycle to truely get a grip on how this relates to whether its good/bad we're
 still talking about BILLIONS of dollars and with Windows 95, god even knows...  Yet we must raise this question:  Would this product have been EVEN 1/2 what it is without the scene? NO WAY!  We must give due credit for the contribution  of ideas, the hou
rs of painstaking testing, the frustrations of crashed  drives, the hours of integration of product we do, the thousands of OEMs that integrate to Windows 95 alone that our people static tested, compatablity issues alone stagger the mind.  Then it happens
, The GALL! the irratating nerve of MicroSoft coming on IRC the way they did, in our domain!  Hell the concept is was valid, but  remember they already exsist on platfroms  and  forums like AOL and CompuServe.  Why, why IRC?  It provides a almost "commerc
ial" like channel to do static in-house testing, to retreve back information that would other wise be incomprehensible in just Cost alone!, (IE their own net, CIS/AOL) Think of it, the value of allowing your intended  userbase to develop the platform it w
ill use itself...think of the cost savings, R&D value alone. To then turn around and add 20 thousand more "Beta Testers" at the tail end of the project, and "Charge their ASS" for  the  damn thing.  The very key information that makes a product successful
.  WE  supply a HUGE amount of this key information and have for years... So you YONES,  do we indeed make more of a positive contribution of the products we evaluate, or do we just facilitate the on-going problem of pirated software?
<P>Feel a bit insulted yet?  Oh REALLY! 
<P>When I hear these statements about pirate software and about the scene, what insults me both personaly and professionally on such a magnitude is an issue that is sort of less obvious.  I speak of another small thing called TALENT! Our community is  mad
e up of clearly the most talented (not to mention manic) individuals any place including any university.  We are the tommorow of software and hardware... just that we don't see our own  real importance cause I guess we're having too much fun....(grin)  Kn
owing the highly technical nature of our industry (grin) the ongoing commitment to only the highest ideals of quality and expertise it strives to represent, and knowing that good thought is used trying to balance the delicate issue of quenching the public
s appetite for software against the budgets to be profitable. (grin) I put it to you and the vendor channel, it's possible we offer a great deal more than what we thought, in fact I'm sure that if it were tabled and presented in the proper forum, keeping 
in mind the nature of the animal..., I think maybe there is a chance that we could bring about the overdue evolvement of our community to its next step. I'll be looking forward always to hearing some feedback to these ideas.. if  anything its movement for
ward... and take others opinions and ideas into consideration.  It provides this forum to at least table some ideas, and that is always the beginings of positive change.
<P>Thanks for the Ear, you Tards!<BR>

e. It used to be a government only way of spreading knowledge to people faster than ordinary means. Later, when the underground society found out about the Internet, every one that had a computer and half a brain could access the Internet with a total dis
regard of the existence of the on-line community and to figure out how fast he/she could get their "/<-r@d w@r3z" to everyone. After a while, when the Internet made a little more news small companies started offering services on how to get on the Internet
. These services weren't bad. They offered usually unlimited time and unlimited access to the Internet. You had to find most of the stuff yourself, but it was cheap. Then, the dread-full part of it all, The Big Time "On Line Services" got a look-see at th
e Internet. America Online, Compuserve, Prodigy (Not sure if Prodigy has the brains to get on the Net yet), and by now, probably Imagination, Genie, and a few others. These companies are terrible. To the normal, (or abnormal) everyday computer user like m
e or you that know what the hell we're doing, these companies ruin it for us. The places that we used to love going, are now invaded by 11 and 12 year old's or Biology teachers that have nothing better to do. Most of this traffic comes from America online
. America Online should be stopped, plain and simple. I  think that America Online should NOT offer Internet services. I have seen America Online's Internet Services. You have to d/l a new copy of aol.exe, it is much MUCH slower than any other SLIP/PPP I 
have ever been on, plus when people on the net see a message or an address that has a @aol.com in it, you are likely to be turned upon. So, if you are on America Online now.. get off and get a real Internet Account. Netcom CAN Provide you a real net accou
nt,  but you have to pay mucho bux, if you can't call their "local access lines". They have an 800 # that has a surcharge. Well, that is just a little talk on my opinion on these horrible online services. I hope this either changed your mind, or opened yo
ur eyes a bit. Later days..

<A NAME="Interview"></A><P><IMG SRC="w_inter.jpg"ALT="---=[ Interview - J-Jamez ]=----------------------------------------------">
<P><CENTER>Interview - J-Jamez</CENTER>
<P>In the month of April, in 1993, a Russian Warez Bear,J-Jamez created the Utils/Games group known as Drink Or Die [DoD]. The group started out slowy, releasing very little programs, and some PPE's. However, who would have known that a small group based 
out of Russia would become the number 1 utils group today? One person knew, The Drink Or Die President, Jimmy Jamez. When posed with the question about it, he replied with his well known motto : "If I want something that much - then I will do it for sure.
" Starting early Spring of 1994, DoD has been steadily increasing it's impact on the warez scene, releasing better utils, and some games. In the end of 1994, DoD praised itself as a 'professional' utils group a merger  occured where all DOD game suplliers
 have joined another upcoming games group,Tyranny. Drink Or Die Games would be released under the Tyranny label. Tyranny was,  and still is , run by Vice President of DoD (Cyber Angel). DoD became the Number 1 force in the utils scene after it's merger wi
th another popluar utils group - Phoenix.  When I asked  Jimmy Jamez what he sees in the future for both DoD and himself, he replied : "Hmmm....Thats a very complicated question :) I dont really know myself. This is all for fun. Like another side of your 
life ... I plan to stay active for some more time and after all, quit." In response to that statement, I asked : "So, are you now getting tired of all this?", he answered,"A little...running such a big group as DoD is very difficult...you need to spend al
ot of time for it...but it gives you much pleasure and satisfaction..". Later on, I asked JJ if he had set a succesor, someone to take care of DoD when he quits the scene. He smugly replied "Hmmm...not really.. :)...   can't see anybody who can replace me
 now and have the same good result. :)". When asked to explain the inner workings of Drink Or Die, JJ replied : "We have a well-prepared internal work system... I can call it an infrastructure..diffrent dudes do different work for the main aim of the grou
p, DoD." Asked to explain who are the basic heads of the group, JJ answered : "I can't say Cyber Angel spends too much time for it... usually I decide about everything." When asked about the lack of competition lately, JJ deftly replied : "Competetion, al
ways there is a competition... PWA is the main and the best competitor... but ofcourse, it is all FRIENDLY competition :)..we help each other to work better and work for the same aim..just in different teams...".
<P>I had asked the Vice president of DOD Cyber Angel to express his opinoin on the future of DOD He answered, "I think that Drink Or Die is on the Top right now, and if we play our cards right, it will remain #1." When asked about J-Jamez's leaving of the
 scene some time soon, Cyber angel replied : "We will all leave the scene when we are tired, but in the case with me and JJ it will probably be way past the year 2000 :)."
<P>And with those words of prophecy, my interview with Jimmy Jamez and Cyber Angel of Drink Or Die ended. Stay tuned next week for a possible special interview with another group leader. For now, Ciao! :)
