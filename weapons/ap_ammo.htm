<h1>Legality of AP Ammo</h1>

<pre>

The definition of AP ammo is at 18 USC sec. 921(a)(17):
  "(B) The term `armor piercing ammunition' means-

  (i) a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and
which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other
substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass,
bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or

  (ii) a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and
intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25
percent of the total weight of the projectile.

  (C) The term `armor piercing ammunition' does not include shotgun shot
required by Federal or State environmental or game regulations for hunting
purposes, a frangible projectile designed for target shooting, a projectile
which the Secretary finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting
purposes, or any other projectile or projectile core which the Secretary
finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes, including a charge 
used in an oil and gas well perforating device."

[Secretary means Secretary of the Treasury, in reality determinations
are delegated to the Technology Branch of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms (ATF)] 

Note the following things from the definition: 

1) The definition was changed as part of the 1994 Crime Bill (9/14/94),
primarily by the addition of "full jacketed" bullets intended to be used 
in a handgun whose jacket is more than 25% of their weight.   The previous
language is at the end of this article, for comparison purposes.  

2) AP ammo is the bullets ONLY, not the loaded ammo, although ATF has
identified some AP ammo by the loaded ammo, not projectiles, for the 
information of FFL dealers, who are not supposed to "willfully" 
transfer AP ammo. 
From this it follows that loading the bullets identified above into
completed rounds does not constitute "making" AP ammo; making the 
bullets themselves does.

3) USE - The bullet must be able to be used in a handgun.   Rather than 
construing this to mean regular handgun calibers, ATF construes this to
mean any caliber for which a handgun has been made, including handguns
in rifle calibers, like .308 Winchester, and 7.62x39, for purposes of 
bullets covered by (B)(i).   Thus bullets suitable for these calibers, 
as well as other rifle calibers for which handguns have been made (at 
least commercially made) which are constructed as described below would 
or should be AP ammo.  However apparently ATF doesn't see it that way,
for instance AP bullets loaded into .30-06 ammo are OK - even though those
bullets are suitable for use in .308 Win. ammo as well, and ATF
does consider that to be a "handgun" round, under these crteria, 
apparently becuase of a very few specialty one shot handguns for
.308 otherwise a rifle round. 
However bullets that fall into the AP definition under (B)(ii), because 
their jackets comprise more than 25% of their weight (solid copper bullets?) 
must be intended for use in a handgun, not just be able to be used in a 
handgun.  

4) CONSTRUCTION - The bullet must either have a core made ENTIRELY out 
of one or more of the listed metals, or be a full jacketed type bullet 
with a jacket comprising more that 25% of its weight.   Thus SS109/M855 
.223 (5.56mm) bullets are not covered, because their core is only partly 
steel, and partly lead.   Lead is not a listed metal, and bullets with 
cores made partly out of lead are OK.   ATF has expressly ruled that 
SS109/M855 bullets are not covered.  

5) Hardness of the bullet is irrelevant.

6) Ability to actually penetrate any kind of soft body armor is irrelevant.

             WHAT FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS ARE PLACED ON AP AMMO?
 
If you are NOT a (FFL) licensee under the Gun Control Act (an individual):
It is:  ok to OWN AP ammo
        ok to SELL AP ammo
        ok to BUY AP ammo
        ok to SHOOT AP ammo
        NOT ok to MAKE AP ammo  (18 USC sec. 922(a)(7))
        NOT ok to IMPORT AP ammo (18 USC sec. 922(a)(7)) 
The only persons who can make AP ammo are holders of a type 10
FFL, also needed to make destructive devices, and ammunition for
destructive devices.  The only persons who can import AP ammo
are holders of a type 11 FFL, who can also import DD's and ammo
for DD's.   The FFL's cost $1000 a year. 

If you are a licensed manufacturer or importer:
NOT ok to SELL or DELIVER AP ammo  (18 USC sec. 922(a)(8)
(with exceptions for making/importing for law enforcement, export, or R&D).
No additional restrictions, except as listed below.  This applies
not only to holders of type 10 and 11 FFL's, but also type 7 and 8
FFL's (makers and importers of guns other than DD's), as well as
holders of a type 06 FFL (maker of ammo other than for DD's).  

If you are a licensed dealer, manufacturer, importer or collector:
NOT ok to SELL or DELIVER AP ammo without keeping a record of the sale, similar
to the bound book record for firearm sales.  (18 USC sec. 922(b)(5)).
No additional restriction, except on dealers as noted below.   
The records required to kept on sale or delivery of AP ammo need only
be kept for two years, not twenty years, like firearm records. See
27 CFR sec. 178.121, and 27 CFR sec. 178.125. 

        18 USC sec. 923(e) allows the revocation of a dealer's FFL
for willfully transferring AP ammo, with exceptions for sales to law
enforcement and so on.   This is dealers only; holders of a collector
FFL (type 03) may willfully transfer AP ammo if they wish, but must comply
with the record keeping noted above. 

Some states also regulate or prohibit armor piercing ammo, and these
laws may bear no relation to how the federal law works.   For state
laws, check locally.   The following states regulate AP ammo,
to my knowledge, but the definition of AP ammo and sort of
regulation may (and likely does) deviate widely from the federal
approach.  NV, OK, RI, VA, AL, NY, NJ, IL, IN, KS, LA, MN, FL, PA, TX, NC.

The former statute: 18 USC 921(a)(17)(B) - "The term 'armor
piercing ammunition' means a projectile or projectile core which
may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding
the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination
of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or
depleted uranium.  Such term does not include shotgun shot required
by Federal or State environmental or game regulations for hunting purposes,
a frangible projectile designed for target shooting, a projectile
which the Secretary finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting
purposes, or any other projectile or projectile core which the 
Secretary finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes,
including a charge used in an oil and gas well perforating device."
