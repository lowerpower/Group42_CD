There has been much media coverage of "Cop Killer" bullets in
the past few years, resulting in restrictive legislation in the
United States. These bullets are usually considered to be pistol
rounds capable of  penetrating the common bullet-resistant
vests.  Commonly they are constructed as normal bullets but with
a hard or heavy penetrator,  usually of steel.<p>

When citizens are unable to obtain such ammunition, it is
possible for criminals to proceed with impunity when wearing
bullet-resistant vests. It is a heinous violation of the natural
rights of citizens to defend themselves to deny them the ability
to kill people wearing protective armor.<p>

Armor piercing ammunition is useful not only for those targets
wearing armor, but those hiding behind light cover and in
vehicles. Rifle ammunition with a hard penetrator is
particularly effective on a  wide variety of potential
"covers".<p>

Further, it is very easy to manufacture armor-piercing
ammunition  in your home, meaning that it will always be
available to those willing to break the law, further widening
the gap between citizens and criminals and police in armament. 
A citizen can expect to have his bullet-resistant armor defeated
by the ammunition a criminal or police officer carries, and to
be unable to penetrate a vest with his legal ammunition.<p>

Bullet-resistant vests are available which will stop even
powerful rifle rounds such as .308 Winchester.  An attacker so
equipped would be very difficult to kill even with military
assault rifles, unless the shooter were using armor piercing
ammunition.<p>

<b><A NAME="design1">Design 1</a> - Steel Ball Penetrator in Hollow-point Ammunition
</b>

<p>

Placing a steel ball penetrator in commercial hollow-point
rounds is a very effective way of improving their penetration. 
Properly placed, the steel ball will suck the softer metals of
the bullet into the created hole, yielding full expansion and
effectiveness behind typical armor.<p>

Penetration depends on the size and weight of the steel ball or
other penetrator, and the energy transferred to it.  The heavier
the remaining portions of the bullet, the less energy will be
transferred to the penetrator.<p>

Yitzhak Rabin's assassin reportedly used ammunition similar to
this design, although the Israeli Prime Minister was not wearing
body armor when he was killed.<p>

The design simply involves planting a small steel ball, such as
a 4.5mm (.177 caliber) <i>steel</i> BB or steel shotgun shot in
the  hollowed nose of hollow-point ammunition.  The penetrator
<i>must</i>  be properly centered along the vector of travel in
the bullet or the bullet will become very unstable in flight. 
You should spin any hand-made ammunition on a lathe or other
similar device to verify that it does not wobble, even at low
rotation speed.<p>

The material inside a hollow-point bullet is usually lead, which
is very soft and can be carved with a steel knife with ease.  A
cavity should be created to very closely match the diameter of
the steel penetrator ball so that it rests, centered on the
diameter of the bullet, without movement.  The penetrator should
<i>not</i> protrude significantly (more than a millimeter or so)
beyond the tip of the bullet, or it could damage your firearm
during feeding.  It is best to have the penetrator entirely
concealed by the casing of the bullet (typically copper).<p>

The steel ball penetrator should be secured in the round with a
very strong glue, such as a "super glue" gel.  This ensures that
the  ball will not fall out of the bullet during feeding or
firing, as well as that it will pull some amount of soft metal
behind it.<p>

Any handmade ammunition should not only be checked for balance
as described above, but manually cycled if it is to be used in a
repeating firearm.<p>

This ammunition would have no trouble penetrating the typical
body armor even if fired from relatively low-power ammunition
such as the 9mm NATO round common in semi-automatic
pistols.<p>

<b><A NAME=design2>Design 2</a> - Sharp Flachette-style Penetrator in Slender Bullets

</b>

<p>

A pointed cylinder is an effective penetrator for several
reasons.  It not only punctures materials with its tip, but
presents a much smaller diameter for its weight than a ball or
disk.  This low diameter translates into less drag (resistance)
as the rod penetrates.<p>

For this design, either hollow-point or soft-tip ammunition is
appropriate. Soft-tip ammunition is preferable, as it allows you
to create a cavity of the ideal diameter for your
penetrator.<p>

To create the cavity, a good technique is to use a hand-drill or
even to spin the bullet on a fixed drill bit.  It is inadvisable
to use a power drill for this task as it will easily melt the
lead and possibly <i>ignite the gunpower</i>.  The cavity should
be slightly smaller than the diameter of your penetrator and
equal to its total length. <p>

The penetrator should not protrude significantly beyond the tip
of the ammunition, and depending on the weapon it is to be used
in, not at all.  Exposed steel can damage your firearm during
feeding.  The  penetrator rod should be secured in its cavity
with a strong glue, such as the "super glue" gel mentioned in
Design 1 above.<p>

The most common source of small steel rods is from nails.  The
head can be removed with bolt- or even wire-cutters, but it is
essential that the cut be smooth to ensure proper balance.  As
with Design 1, it is <i>essential</i> that the penetrator be
centered along the line of travel and that the bullet be
properly balanced.  Test any hand-made ammunition for proper
balance and feeding before using it.<p>

Slender bullets, typically found in "rifle" ammunition, are
ideal for this design as they present much more room for a long
cavity than what are commonly referred to as pistol rounds.<p>

This design is capable of massive penetration of hard materials
when used in powerful rifle ammunition, such as .308 Winchester.
You can expect to penetrate up to 1/2" of steel armor with this
design in a .308 round. That's twice the width of the hulls of
most US Navy warships.  This would result in massive over-penetration if used
on a person, even wearing body armor.<p>
