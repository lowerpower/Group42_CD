STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION
 
 "A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security
of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed. The individual right to keep
and bear arms shall not be denied or infringed by the state
or political subdivision of the State." Article 1, Section
19.
 

POSSESSION
 
     No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun
or handgun.
 
     It is unlawful for a person convicted of a felony or
adjudicated a delinquent minor for conduct that would
constitute a felony if committed by an adult to possess a
"firearm capable of being concealed on his person" unless a
period of 10 years or more has elapsed between the date of
the person's unconditional discharge on the prior offense or
adjudication of juvenile delinquency.
 
     It is unlawful to knowingly possess a firearm on which
the manufacturer's serial number has been removed, covered,
altered or destroyed with the intent of rendering the
firearm untraceable. A person may not possess a firearm
while his physical or men- tal condition is "substantially
impaired" as a result of an intoxicating liquor or drug.
 
     Loaded firearms may not be possessed in any place where
intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption on the premises.
Exempt from this prohibition is the owner or lessee or an
employee in the course of his employment for the owner or
lessee while on the business premise. A firearm is loaded if
the firing chamber, magazine, clip or cylinder of the
firearm contains a cartridge.
 
     An unemancipated minor under 16 years of age may not
possess a firearm without the consent of his parent or
guardian.

     No state permit is required to purchase a rifle,
shotgun or handgun.
 
     It is unlawful to sell or transfer a firearm capable of
being concealed on one's person to anyone who has been
convicted of a felony. It is an affirmative defense that 10
ybars or more has elapsed since the uncon- ditional
discharge on the prior offense.
 
     It is unlawful to knowingly sell or transfer a firearm
to a person whose physical or mental condition is
"substantially impaired" as a result of an intoxicating
liquor or drug.
