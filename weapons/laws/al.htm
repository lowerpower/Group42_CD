<H1>Alabama: State Firearms Laws</H1> (As of August 1995) <p>

<B>PLEASE NOTE:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale and
(in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate
transportation of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of
1968 as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection Act. Also,
cities and localities may have their own firearms ordinances in
addition to federal and state laws. Details may be obtained by
contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by consulting

<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>

"That every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of
himself and the state." Article 1, Section 26.<p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 

     No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun, or
handgun(1). It is unlawful for a drug addict, habitual drunkard, or
one who has been convicted of a crime of violence(2) to own,
possess, or have under his control, a handgun. Law enforcement
authorities have advised that minors cannot carry or possess a
handgun.<p>
<ol>
<li>A handgun is defined as any firearm with a barrel less than 12
inches.
<li>A crime of violence is defined as committing or attempting to
commit murder, manslaughter (except vehicular), rape, mayhem,
robbery, burglary, kidnapping, larceny, and assault with intent
to rob, ravish, or murder.
</ol>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 

     To purchase a handgun, the buyer must complete an
application to purchase. The application must be filled out in
triplicate and delivered to the seller. The form contains the
purchaser's name, address, occupation, color, place of birth, the
date and hour of application, the caliber, make, model, and
serial number of the firearm, and a statement that the purchaser
has never been convicted of a crime of violence. The seller is
required to mail one form within six hours after such application
to the chief of police of the municipality or the county sheriff
of which the seller is a resident, one copy is sent to the public
safety director within seven days, and one copy is to be kept by
the seller for six years.<p>
     The seller must wait forty-eight hours after the application
has been completed before delivering the handgun to the
purchaser. The handgun must be unloaded and securely wrapped when
delivered.<p>
     It is unlawful to deliver a handgun to any person under 18,
or to a person whom the seller has reasonable cause to believe
has been convicted of a crime of violence, is a drug addict, is
an habitual drunkard, or is of unsound mind.<p>

<H2>Carrying</H2> 

     No person shall carry a handgun in any vehicle or concealed
on or about his person without a license to carry. A permit is
not required when a person on foot carries an unconcealed handgun
on public property or when a person is on his own land or in his
own abode or in his fixed place of business.<p>
     Exempt from this prohibition are:
<ol>
<li>Law enforcement personnel.
<li>Military personnel when on duty or going to or from duty.
<li>The regularly enrolled members of any organization duly
authorized to purchase or receive such weapons from the state    
or U.S., when such members are at or are going to or from their
places of assembly or target practice.
(It is generally agreed that the "NRA exception" permits the
carrying of unloaded cased handguns in the trunk of an automobile
directly to a place of assembly or target practice and back.)
<li>Persons carrying unloaded handguns in a secure wrapper
from a place of purchase to one's home or place of business, or
to or from a place of repair, or in moving from one place of
abode or business to another.
</ol>

     Exempt from prohibition of carrying a handgun on premises
not his own or under his control are: peace officers, rural free
delivery mail carriers, conductors, railway mail clerks, and
express messengers, in the discharge of their duties.<p>
A qualified or unlimited license to carry a handgun in a vehicle
or concealed on or about one's person for not more than one year
may be issued by a sheriff of the county where the applicant
resides if it appears the applicant has good reason to fear
injury to his person or property or has any other proper reason
for carrying a handgun, and that "he is a suitable person" to be
so licensed. The sheriff may revoke a license upon proof that the
license holder is not a "proper person to be licensed." The fee
for a license varies, depending on the county.<p>
Rifles and shotguns carried in a vehicle must be unloaded.<p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 

     Handguns possessed as curiosities or ornaments are exempt
from the provisions on purchase, possession, sale, or to the
transportation of such handguns unloaded and in a bag, box, or
securely wrapped package, but not concealed on the person. The
same provisions apply to handguns, rifles, or shotguns made in or
before 1898, or to blackpowder replicas not made to fire fixed
ammunition.<p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 

     There are no state prohibitions against machine guns
provided that federal law is complied with.<p>

<H2> Miscellaneous</H2>
     It is unlawful to change, alter, remove, or obliterate the
name of the maker, model, serial number, or other mark of
identification of any handgun. It shall be prima facie evidence
that the possessor of such handgun performed the unlawful act.<p>

     It is unlawful to make any loan secured by a mortgage,
deposit, or pledge of a handgun.<p>

     It is unlawful to supply false information or evidence in
purchasing or otherwise securing delivery of a pistol, or in
applying for a license to carry a handgun.<p>

     It is unlawful to possess any firearm on one's person or in
a vehicle while attending or participating in any demonstration
at a public place, or within 1,000 feet of a demonstration after
being warned by a police officer.<p>

     Units of local government have no power to enact any
ordinance, rule, or regulation which shall tax, restrict,
prevent, or in any way affect the possession of ownership of
handguns.<p>

     It is unlawful to possess or sell brass or steel teflon
coated handgun ammunition or to have such ammunition in a
person's immediate possession in the commission of a felony.<p>

     It is unlawful to carry or possess any firearm within any
wildlife management without a "permit allowing this privilege."<p>

     It is unlawful to hunt or discharge a firearm within 100
yards of any road or railroad without permission from an adjacent
landowner.<p>
