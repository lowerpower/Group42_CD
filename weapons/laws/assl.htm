<H1>American Samoa</H1> (1994) <p>

<B>PLEASE NOTE:</B> In addition to territorial laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate
transportation of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of
1968 as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection Act. Also,
cities and localities may have their own firearms ordinances in
addition to federal and territory laws. Details may be obtained
by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances - Firearms</cite>,
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.<p>
