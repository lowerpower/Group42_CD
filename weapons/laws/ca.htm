<H1>California: State Firearms Laws</H1> (As of September, 1995) <p>

<B>PLEASE NOTE:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968 as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by 
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances--Firearms</cite>,

<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>
None.<p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
It is unlawful for anyone convicted of a felony, or who is a drug addict,
present or former mental patient, ever committed for mental observation, or
acquitted by reason of insanity to own or possess any firearm. People with
certain misdemeanor convictions involving force or violence may not possess
or own any firearm with 10 years of the conviction. A person who has been
adjudicated as a juvenile offender or delinquent for any offense which would
be classified as felony or misdemeanor involving force or violence if
committed by an adult may not own or possess any firearm until age 30. A minor
may not possess a handgun except with written permission or under the 
supervision of a parent or guardian. <p>

<H2>Possession of "Assault Weapons"</H2> 
"Assault weapons" are listed in Section 12276 and include
certain rifles, pistols and shotguns. (See "Miscellaneous 
Provisions" for list). The Attorney General also has the authority 
to petition a court for additional firearms to be added to the 
list of "assault weapons." After limited notice and a hearing, 
such other firearms may be added to the list by the court.<p>
Any person lawfully possessing an "assault weapon" before 
June 1, 1989, was to register the firearm with the Department of 
Justice by March 31, 1992, although it is reported that 
registration applications are being accepted after that date. 
Registration includes identification of the firearm and the name, 
address, date of birth, thumbprint and other information on the 
owner.  A fee of up to $20.00 may be charged for the registration.
Any firearm subsequently added to the list of "assault weapons"
must be registered within 90 days.<p> 
Unless otherwise specified, registered "assault weapons" 
may only be possessed:
<ol>
<li>At registrant's residence, place of business, or other property owned by
    such registrant, or on property owned by another with permission.
<li>At recognized target ranges or shooting clubs.
<li>At recognized exhibitions.
<li>Traveling to or from the forgoing.
</ol>
No lawfully possessed "assault weapon" may be sold or 
transferred on or after January 1, 1990, in California to anyone 
other than a licensed gun dealer. (Exception is made for previously 
registered firearms that are inherited, or firearms brought into the 
state by people moving in, but in either case the firearms must be 
registered within 90 days under the machine gun requirements 
of California law.)<p>
Failure to register an "assault weapon" possessed before 
June 1, 1989, may, for a first time infraction, result in a fine 
between $350.00 and $500.00. Unlawful manufacture, distribution,
transportation, importation, sale, or otherwise giving or lending 
an "assault weapon" is a felony punishable by up to eight years 
in jail.<p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
Transfer or sale of all firearms must be processed with a 
California gun dealer's license. An application for transfer must
be made with the gun dealer before any firearm may be sold or 
transferred. This application contains a description of the buyer 
or transferee and of the firearm. A copy is sent by the dealer 
to the California Department of Justice and the local police 
chief or sheriff.  The dealer may be charged a fee up to $14 by
the Department of Justice.  If the Department of Justice
determines that the buyer or transferee is not eligible to 
possess a firearm, they shall notify the dealer immediately.
There is a 15-day waiting period before delivery of any firearm.
Dealers must keep a register of all firearm transfers. A person 
under restraining order may not acquire any firearm. <p>
Starting October 1, 1993, no firearm capable of being 
concealed upon the person shall be delivered or sold unless the 
person receiving the firearm presents to the gun dealer a basic 
firearms safety certificate approved by the California 
Department of Justice.<p>
       A gun dealer must post a sign advising "If you leave a 
loaded firearm where a child obtains and improperly uses it, you 
may be fined or sent to prison." <p>
       The waiting period and dealer application do not apply to 
transfers to police officers, other gun dealers, manufacturers,
or importers, antique firearms, and rifles and shotguns which are 
classified as curios or relics by the federal government, 
infrequent gifts or transfers to one's "immediate family," an 
infrequent temporary loan not to exceed 30 days to a person who 
is not prohibited from possessing a firearm, and a transfer of a 
rifle or shotgun at auctions by nonprofit or public benefit 
corporations. <p>
       It is unlawful for any person to transfer any firearm to a 
person who is forbidden to possess or own a firearm. A dealer may 
not transfer a pistol to a person under 21 or other firearm to a 
person under 18.<p>
       It is unlawful to purchase, receive, or attempt to purchase
or receive a firearm if such person is subject to a protective
order, temporary restraining order or injunction.<p>

<H2>Carrying</H2> 
       It is unlawful to carry a loaded rifle, shotgun, or handgun
in any public place or on any public street in an incorporated 
area or an area where firing a firearm is prohibited. In 
California, a firearm is considered loaded if unexpended 
ammunition capable of being used in the firearm is attached in
any manner to the firearm. The following persons and situations are 
exceptions: 
<ol>
<li>Persons shooting on target ranges, or while hunting on the premises
    of a shooting club.
<li>A person who reasonably believes that he or his property is in immediate
    danger and the weapon must be carried for "preservation." (Claiming
    this exception is difficult, since a person accused of a violation must
    prove in court the "reasonableness" of his belief.)
<li>A person "engaged in the act of making or attempting lawful arrest."
<li>A person carrying a firearm while at home or at his place of business,
    including temporary residences and campsites.
</ol>
       Carrying a handgun concealed is prohibited without a
license. The law states that "Firearms carried openly in belt 
holsters are not concealed within the meaning of this section."<p>
       Application for a license to carry a concealed firearm is
made to the county sheriff or the city chief of police. <p>
       The officer may issue a license if the applicant establishes 
that he or she is "of good moral character," a resident of the 
county and that "good cause exists" for the issuance of the 
license. <p>
       The issuing officer has the power to include, in his 
discretion any "reasonable" restrictions on the license to carry 
(such as the time, place, etc.). <p>
       The application must contain a description of the licensee 
and the gun or guns to be carried. The applicant must be 
fingerprinted and a copy of the prints sent to the Department of 
Justice.<p>
<b>Note:</b> Despite the existence of this licensing procedure, it is reported
that in many California counties, the license is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to obtain. <p>

<H2>Carrying and Transportation in Vehicles</H2> 
       Carrying a handgun concealed with a vehicle is prohibited 
without a license.  A handgun carried in a glove compartment or 
under the seat of a vehicle is considered to be concealed. A 
handgun placed in the trunk of an automobile, or locked in a 
container in the vehicle other than the utility or glove 
compartment or while in a locked container carried directly to or 
from a vehicle is deemed not to be "concealed."  A locked 
container means a fully enclosed secure container locked by a key 
lock or similar locking device.<p>
       Exceptions to this prohibition are:
<ol>
<li>Members of clubs organized for practice shooting while on any established
    target range or going to and from such range.
<li>Licensed hunters and fishermen while engaged in hunting or fishing and 
    while going to or from such hunting or fishing expeditions.
<li>Members of an antique or historical collector's club while at a show,
    or while going to and from a display as long as the weapons are locked
    in a trunk or are in a locked container.
</ol>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
Antique firearm means any firearm not designed or redesigned
for using rimfire or centerfire ammunition and manufactured in or 
before 1898 (including any matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap 
or similar type of ignition system or replica thereof, whether 
actually manufactured before 1898) and also any firearm 
manufactured in or before 1898 using fixed ammunition which is no 
longer manufactured in the U.S. and is not readily available in 
the ordinary channels of commercial trade. <p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
A machine gun is defined as any firearm which shoots, or is
designed to shoot, automatically, more than one shot, without 
manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The term 
also includes any conversion part, frame or receiver of a machine 
gun, or any firearm deemed as such by the federal government. 
Upon a showing of good cause, a permit for the possession and/or 
transportation may be issued by the Department of Justice.<p>
It is unlawful to possess a destructive device, including 
tracer or incendiary ammunition or any firearm larger than .60 
caliber which fires fixed ammunition, or any fixed ammunition for
such firearm.  Excluded are shotguns and shotgun ammunition. <p>
<B>Note:</B> It has been reported that the Department of Justice refuses
to grant such permits. <p>

<H2> Miscellaneous Provisions</H2>
       No license or permit shall be required to possess, keep or 
carry a handgun openly or concealed in one's home or place of 
business.<p>
       The state legislature also has expressed its intention to 
occupy the whole field of the regulation and licensing of 
firearms, thus precluding cities and other localities from 
enacting firearms laws.<p>
       It is unlawful to set any spring or "trap" gun.<p>
       It is unlawful to change, alter or remove the serial number, 
maker's name or other identifying mark from any firearm, unless 
one has secured the written permission of the Department of 
Justice. Possession of a firearm with altered identifying marks 
creates a legal presumption that the possessor committed the 
offense. <p>
       It is unlawful to possess a firearm on the grounds or in the 
buildings of any school without permission of the school 
authorities, or courthouse. State Capitol building or grounds, 
any legislative office or the office or residence of the 
Governor, constitutional officer or member of the Legislature.<p>
       A minor may not possess live ammunition except with 
the written permission or under the supervision of a parent or 
guardian, or while going to or from an organized lawful 
recreational or competitive shooting activity or lawful hunting 
activity. <p>
       It is unlawful to possess, transport, or sell ammunition 
principally for use in a handgun which is "designed primarily to 
penetrate metal or armor." It is unlawful to possess a 
multi-burst trigger activator or zipgun. <p>
       It is unlawful to store a loaded firearm where the person
knows or reasonably should know that a child under 14 is likely
to gain access to the firearm without the permission of the
child's parent or legal guardian and the child obtains access to
the firearm and causes death or great bodily harm to self or any
other person.  This prohibition shall not apply if: (1) the child
obtains the firearm as a result of an illegal entry to any
premises by any person; (2) the firearm is kept in a locked
container or in a location which a reasonable person would
believe to be secure; (3) the firearm is carried on the person or
within such a close proximity so that the individual can readily
retrieve and use the firearm as if carried on the person; (4) the
firearm is equipped with a locking device; (5) the person is a
peace officer or member of the U. S.  armed forces and the child
obtains the firearm during, or incidental to, the performance of
the person's duties; (6) the child obtains, or obtains and
discharges, the firearm in a lawful act of self-defense or
defense of another person; and (7) the person who keeps a loaded
firearm on any premise which is under person's custody or control
has no reasonable expectation, based on objective facts and
circumstances, that a child is likely to be present on the
premise. <p>
