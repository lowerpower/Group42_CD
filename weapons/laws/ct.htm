<H1>Connecticut: State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of April 1995) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate
transportation of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control
Act of 1968 as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection
Act. Also, cities and localities may have their own firearms
ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement
authorities, and by consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published
Ordinances--Firearms</cite>, available from the U.S. Government
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.<p>

<H2>State Constitutional Provision on Firearms</H2>
     "Every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of
himself and the state.'' Article I, Section 15. <p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 

     No state permit is required for the possession of
rifles, shotguns or handguns. <p>
     It is unlawful to possess a handgun by a person who has
been convicted of a felony, illegal possession of a
controlled substance, negligent homicide, third degree
assault, first degree reckless endangerment, second degree
unlawful restraint, rioting, or second degree stalking;
discharged from custody within the preceding 20 years after
acquittal by reason of mental disease or defect; confined by
court order for mental illness within the preceding 12
months; subject to a restraining or protective order
involving physical force; or an illegal alien. It is
unlawful to possess any other firearm by a person who has
been convicted of a felony.<p>
 
<H2>Purchase</H2> 
     No state permit is required for the purchase of rifles
or shotguns.<p>
     It is unlawful to sell a firearm to any person
convicted of a felony, any alien, or any minor under the age
of 18. It is unlawful to sell or transfer a handgun to any
person who is forbidden to possess a handgun (see
POSSESSION), or to a person under 21. However, a handgun may
be temporarily transferred to a person under 21 for target
shooting under the immediate supervision of a person
eligible to possess a handgun and such use is otherwise
permitted by law.<p>
     No person, firm, or corporation shall sell or transfer
a firearm unless an application provided by the commissioner
of public safety is filled out. Copies are sent to the
commissioner, to the police chief where the applicant
resides, or, if there is no police chief, to the first
selectmen or warden of such municipality. There is a 2 weeks
waiting period. Upon sale or transfer, the recipient of the
firearm signs a form containing a full description of
himself or herself and the firearm, including serial number.
Copies of the receipt are sent to the police, a copy is
retained by the person making the sale or transfer, and a
copy is given to the recipient of the firearm. If a handgun,
on and after October 1, 1995, the receipt shall also contain
the identification number of the recipient's permit to
carry, permit to sell handguns at retail, or handgun
eligibility certificate and the authorization number
designated for the transfer by the department of public
safety. The commissioner shall establish a data base that
any person selling or transferring a handgun may access to
determine if the recipient's permit to carry, permit to
sell, or eligibility certificate is valid.<p>
     A handgun eligibility certificate, valid for 5 years,
shall be issued by the commissioner of public safety within
90 days after filing of the application to a person who may
lawfully possess a handgun, who completes a handgun safety
course, is fingerprinted, and pays $35. The eligibility
certificate entitles a person to purchase, but not to carry,
a handgun. The commissioner must be notified within 2
business days of an address change.<p>
     The waiting period is waived for police and parole
officers, holders of a permit to carry, permit to sell
handguns, or handgun eligibility certificate, but all forms
must be filled out. Holders of a valid Connecticut hunting
license and active or reserve members of the armed forces
are also exempt from the waiting period on rifles and
shotguns. Antique firearms are exempted from both the
waiting period and application form requirements.<p>
 

<H2>Carry</H2> 
     A permit is required to carry a handgun on or about
one's person, or in a vehicle.<p>
     Application for a permit is made to the local Chief of
Police or other issuing authority. The applicant must
provide a full description and be fingerprinted. The Chief
of Police is required to conduct an investigation concerning
the applicant's "suitability to carry any such weapons." The
applicant must successfully complete a handgun safety course
approved by the commissioner. An approved course includes
one utilizing instructors certified by the NRA.<p>
     A permit may be issued if the issuing authority finds
that the applicant "intends to make no use of any pistol or
revolver which he may be permitted to carry ... other than a
lawful use", and that the applicant "is a suitable person to
receive such permit". No showing of a "need" to carry a
handgun is required, and Connecticut courts have ruled that
a permit may not be denied on a basis of "insufficient
need." No permit will be issued to any person ineligible to
possess a handgun. The applicant must be notified within
eight weeks of the issuing authority's decision.<p>
     The local issuing authority may issue a permit to carry
valid only within his jurisdiction. A permit to carry within
the entire state can be issued only by the Commissioner of
State Police. To obtain a statewide permit to carry, the
applicant must already possess a local permit to carry. The
commissioner must be notified within 2 business days of an
address change.<p>
     Once issued--and kept continuously in force without
lapse or revocation--a statewide permit may be renewed
without further issuance or renewal of a local permit. Thus,
if a holder of a statewide permit moves to another part of
the state, it is not necessary for him to obtain a local
permit from the authorities in his new community in order to
renew his statewide permit.<p>
     A permit to carry may be revoked "for cause" if the
issuing authority determines that the permit holder is no
longer a "suitable person" to carry a handgun. Although
facts justifying any such revocation must be shown, the
authorities have broad discretion, and conduct by the permit
holder which is not necessarily a violation of law may be
sufficient to support a revocation.<p>
     An eligibility certificate revocation or refusal to
issue or renewal may be appealed within 90 days to the Board
of Permit Examiners, State Armory, 360 Broad Street,
Hartford, CT 06115. No fee is charged for this review. A
revocation or refusal to issue will be overturned by the
Board if not for a "just and proper cause". Either the
applicant or the issuing authority may appeal any decision
of the Board to the courts.<p>
     No permit to carry is required:
<ol>
<li>if the person carrying is a "peace officer";
<li>while in one's own home or place of business;
<li>While carrying a handgun from the place of purchase to 
one's residence or place of business if "it is contained in 
the package in which it was originally wrapped at the time 
of sale";
<li>while moving one's residence from one place to another;
<li>while carrying a handgun from his residence or place of 
business to a place of repair and back;
<li>to carry an antique handgun.
</ol><p>

     The fee for the original permit to carry is $35.00; the
renewal is $35.00. Each original or renewal is valid for
five years.<p>
     A permit to carry is required to carry a handgun
outside one's home (even though one may still be on his own
property) or in any "place of business" in which one is
merely an employee, not an owner or operator. A permit is
also required to transport a handgun back and forth between
one's home and place of business, or to and from a range for
target shooting.<p>
     It is unlawful to possess a firearm on elementary or
secondary school property. This prohibition shall not apply
to a person with a firearm carrying permit, with permission
from school officials, or while traversing school property
with an unloaded firearm for the purpose of gaining access
to lands open to hunting or for other lawful purposes,
provided entry is not prohibited by school officials.<p>

 
<H2>Non-Residents</H2> 
 
     A non-resident may carry a handgun in or through
Connecticut for the purpose of taking part in a competition
or an exhibition provided he is a resident of the U.S. and
has a valid permit to carry any firearm issued by the
authority of any other state or locality.<p>
 

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
 
     An antique firearm is defined as "any firearm which was
manufactured in or before 1898 and any replica of such
firearm provided such replica is not designed or redesigned
for using rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed
ammunition except rimfire or conventional centerfire
ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United
States and not readily available in the ordinary channel of
commercial trade."<p>
 
<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
 
     Possession of a machine gun for an "aggressive or
offensive purpose" is prohibited, and is punishable by
imprisonment up to 10 years.<p>
     A machine gun is any weapon designed or readily
restored to shoot automatically more than one bullet,
without manual reloading, by a single function of the
trigger. It also includes parts designed to convert a weapon
into a machine gun.<p>
     Each machine gun shall be registered in the office  of
the commissioner of public safety within 24 hours after
acquisition and, thereafter, annually on July 1.<p>
     A presumption of possession for an offensive or
aggressive purpose is raised:<p>
<ol>
<li>by failure to register a machine gun of a type required
to be registered (see above).
<li>by possession at a place other than the possessor's home,
land or place of business.
<li>when empty or loaded cartridges which have been or are
susceptible for use in the machine gun are found in the
immediate vicinity thereof.
</ol>
     It is lawful to possess a machine gun in compliance
with federal law, provided annual registration takes place
with the state police.<p>

<H2> Miscellaneous Provisions</H2><p>

     Loaded shotguns and rifles may not be carried in a
vehicle or snowmobile. Muzzle-loading rifles and shotguns
are regarded as "unloaded" even though a charge may be in
the bore, provided there is no powder in the flash pan or
percussion cap on the nipple.<p>

     It is unlawful to alter, remove or obliterate the name
of any make or model or number or other mark of
identification on any handgun. The possession of any handgun
with its numbers or other marks altered creates a legal
presumption that the possessor committed the offense.<p>

     It is lawful to hunt with a handgun provided the hunter
has a permit to carry and complies with all hunting laws;
however, a handgun may not be used to hunt waterfowl or
deer.<p>

     Persons convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon
"shall be sentenced" to five (5) years, which sentence may
not be suspended or reduced by the court.<p>

     Persons convicted of assault with a deadly weapon or
instrument shall be confined for 5 years, which term shall
not be suspended or reduced.<p>

     Absent mitigating circumstances, any person convicted
of carrying a firearm without a permit shall receive a
mandatory one year penalty.<p>

      No person shall keep or store any loaded firearm on
any premises under his control if he knows or reasonably
should know that a person under 16 is likely to gain access
without parent's or guardian's permission, unless it is in a
location which a reasonable person would believe to be
secured, is carried on the person or within close proximity,
or is in a locked container.<p>

     Retail sellers of firearms shall provide a purchaser
with a gun locking device and a warning about the unlawful
storage of a loaded firearm.<p>

90 days of obtaining title, apply to the department of
public safety for a certificate of possession, render the
weapon inoperable, sell the weapon to a licensed gun dealer,
or remove the weapon from the state. Any person who moves
into the state in lawful possession of an assault weapon
shall, within 90 days, either render it permanently
inoperable, sell it to a licensed gun dealer, or remove it
from the state.<p>
     A person who has been issued a certificate of
possession of an assault weapon may possess it only under
the following conditions:
<ol>
<li>At the person's residence, place of business or other
