<H1>Iowa:  Your State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of April 1994) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by 
consulting the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm's <cite>State Laws and 
Published Ordinances--Firearms</cite>, available from the U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<p>

<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>
None.<p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun, or handgun.<p>
It is unlawful for any person who is convicted of a felony to subsequently
possess, receive, or transport or cause to be transported a firearm or 
offensive weapon.<p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
No permit is required to purchase of a rifle or shotgun.<p>
A permit is required to purchase a handgun. The permit to purchase may be
used to purchase more than one handgun. The permit is required for nondealer
purchases as well as purchases from a dealer. A permit is not required for 
antique handguns, handguns not capable of being readily restored to a firing
condition, a handgun designated a ``collector's item'' by the Commissioner
of Public Safety, transfers between relatives within the second degree of
consanguinity or affinity, or by a holder of handgun carrying permit.<p>
A permit to purchase a handgun is obtained by applying to the sheriff of any
county. The application shall state the applicant's full name, Social
Security number, residence, and age.  The permit ``shall be issued to the 
applicant immediately upon completion of the application.'' A record check is
conducted. The permit becomes valid three days after issuance and is good 
for one year. The whole process of obtaining the permit may be handled by 
mail. There is no fee for the permit.<p>
Note: Some sheriffs have been requesting thumbprints on applications for 
purchase permits.<p>
An annual permit to purchase a handgun shall not be issued to any person
unless:<p>
<ol>
<li>The person is 21 and has never been convicted of a felony or serious 
    assault, except for simple assault and/or harassment, and has no history
    of repeated acts of violence.
<li>The person is not addicted to the use of alcohol or a controlled 
    substance.
<li>The person has never been adjudged mentally defective.
</ol>
It is unlawful to sell, loan, give, or make available a rifle or shotgun or 
ammunition therefor to a person under 18. Caliber .22 rimfire ammunition is
deemed to be rifle ammunition.  However, a parent, guardian, spouse who is 18
or older, or another with the express consent of the minor's parent or 
guardian or spouse who is 18 or older may allow a minor to possess a rifle
or shotgun or ammunition therefor which may be lawfully used.<p>
It is unlawful to sell, loan, give, or make available a handgun or ammunition
therefore to a person under 21. Exceptions to this prohibition are:
<ol>
<li>A parent, guardian, or spouse who is 21 or older, of a person less than 21
    but at least 14 may allow the person to possess a handgun or ammunition
    therefor for any lawful purpose while under the direct supervision of the 
    parent or guardian or spouse who is 21 or older, or while the person 
    receives instruction in the proper use of handguns from an instructor 21 
    or older, with the consent of such parent, guardian or spouse.
<li>A person under 21 but at least 18 may possess a handgun and ammunition
    therefore while on military duty, while a peace officer, security guard,
    or correctional officer, when such duty requires the possession of such
    a weapon or while the person receives instruction in the proper use of 
    a handgun from an instructor who is 21 or older.
</ol>

<H2>Carrying</H2> 
It is unlawful if a person ``goes armed'' with a handgun or any loaded firearm
of any kind within the limits of any city, whether concealed or not. It is also
unlawful to go armed with a handgun concealed on or about one's person or 
to knowingly carry or transport a handgun in a vehicle.<p>
Exceptions to the above prohibition are: <p>
<ol>
<li>Carrying in a dwelling, place of business, or on land owned or possessed
    by the person.
<li>Peace officers, correctional officers, members of the armed forces, or
    persons in the service of the United States when carrying weapons in
    connection with their duties.
<li>Carrying an unloaded handgun or other firearm for any lawful purpose
    inside a  closed and fastened container or securely wrapped package which
    is too large to be concealed on the person.
<li>Carrying or transporting an unloaded handgun in any vehicle inside a 
    cargo or luggage compartment where the handgun will not be readily 
    accessible to any person riding in the vehicle or common carrier.
<li>Carrying openly while engaged in target practice on a range designed for
    that purpose or while actually engaged in lawful hunting.
<li>Possessors of a valid permit to carry a handgun whose conduct is within
    the limits of that permit.
</ol>
Rifles and shotguns carried in vehicles must be unloaded in the chamber and
magazine and must be either encased or broken down.<p>

<H2>Permit To Carry</H2> 
It is unlawful for a person to carry any dangerous weapon on or about his 
person without a permit. Permits to carry a weapon come in two forms---
professional and nonprofessional. Residents make application to the local
sheriff, nonresidents make application to the Commissioner of Public Safety.
Permits are valid for 12 months; the fee is $10.00. Renewal and duplicate
permits are $5.00. ``The issuance of the permit shall be by and at the 
discretion of the sheriff or commissioner [of Public Safety].''<p>
Professional permits are issued to guards, bank messengers, peace officers, 
or other persons whose job ``reasonably justifies that person going armed.''
The permit holder may ``go armed anywhere in the state, only while engaged
in such employment, and while going to and from the place of such 
employment.'' A permit issued to a peace officer authorizes him to go 
armed anywhere in the state at all times.<p>
A nonprofessional permit ``may be issued'' to a person ``who can reasonably
justify his or her going armed.'' Any restrictions are listed on the permit. To 
obtain a professional or nonprofessional permit, an applicant must be: at least
18 and have never been convicted of a felony, not addicted to alcohol or any 
controlled substance, and have no history of repeated acts of violence.<p>
The issuing officer ``reasonably determines that the applicant does not 
constitute a danger to any person,'' and has never been convicted of any 
felonies or serious assaults except for simple assault and/or harassment.<p>
The application contains the applicant's name, Social Security number
(optional), residence, age and information on any felony convictions,
addiction to alcohol or a controlled substance, or ``any history of mental
illness or repeated acts of violence.'' New applicants are fingerprinted by 
some licensing authorities. The applicant must successfully complete a 
firearms instruction course which includes a proficiency test with a handgun.
The training program must be approved by the Commissioner of Public Safety,
and the Commissioner or county sheriff may conduct it or may contract with a
private organization or use the services of other agencies, or may use a 
combination of the two, to provide such training. The fee is currently
$20.00.<p>
Police officers trained at a police academy need not take the training 
program. The training requirements ``may be waived for renewal permits.''<p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
An antique firearm is ``any firearm (including any firearm with a matchlock,
percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system) manufactured in or before
1898. An antique firearm also means a replica of a firearm so described if
the replica is not designed or redesigned for using conventional rimfire
or conventional centerfire fixed ammunition or if the replica uses fixed 
ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United States and which is
not readily available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade.<p>
Antique and replica firearms are exempt from the permit to purchase 
requirement. The same laws on carrying that apply to modern firearms apply
to antique and replica firearms.<p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
``A machine gun is a firearm which shoots or is designed to shoot more than 
one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.''<p>
State law prohibits the possession of machine guns by private parties. 
Exceptions are dealers who sell to peace officers or the armed forces, and
any firm lawfulfully engaged in improvement, invention, or manufacture of
firearms.<p>

<H2> Miscellaneous</H2><p>
Persons found guilty of a forcible felony and who represented that he or she
was in the immediate possession or control of a firearm, displayed a firearm
in a threatening manner, or were armed with a firearm, shall serve a minimum
of five years of the sentence imposed by law and shall not be eligible for
parole until such minimum sentence has been served.<p>
A state statute prohibits a unit of local government to regulate the ownership,
possession, transfer, transportation, registration, or licensing of firearms 
otherwise lawful under state law.<p>
Loaded firearms must be secured from minors under 14.<p>
It is unlawful to possess a bullet that explodes or a shotshell or cartridge 
intended to project a flame or fireball to simulate a flamethrower.<p>
