<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>
``The people have the right to keep and bear arms, which right shall not be
abridged; but this provision shall not prevent the passage of laws to govern
the carrying of weapons concealed on the person, nor prevent passage of 
legislation providing minimum sentences for crimes committed while in the 
possession of a firearm, nor prevent passage of legislation providing penalties
for the possession of firearms by a convicted felon, nor prevent the passage 
of legislation punishing the use of a firearm.  No law shall impose licensure,
registration or special taxation on the ownership or possession of firearms or 
ammunition.  Nor shall any law permit the confiscation of firearms except 
those actually used in the commission of a felony.'' Article 1, Section 11.<p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun or handgun.<p>
It is unlawful for any person to have in his possession any uncased firearm
while in the fields or forests of the state without having first procured
a hunting license.  No license is required for residents to carry uncased
firearms on property owned, leased, or controlled by them or on adjoining
property for the purpose of taking predatory animals.<p>
It is unlawful to possess or carry any firearm while intoxicated.<p>
It is unlawful for a child under 12 to have in his or her possession any
shotgun, rifle, or other firearm while in the fields or forests or in any
tent, camp, auto, or any other vehicle.<p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
There is no state permit required for the purchase of any rifle, shotgun, 
or handgun. <p>
It is unlawful to sell, deliver, loan, or barter any firearm or 
ammunition to any person under the age of 16 or without the consent of that
person's parent or guardian. (The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits the sale
by a licensed dealer of a handgun, or ammunition for a handgun to anyone
under 21 and prohibits the sale of a rifle or shotgun, or ammunition therefor,
to anyone under 18.) <p>

<H2>Carrying</H2> 
It is unlawful to ``carry concealed upon or about'' one's person without a 
permit in the following areas:
<ol>
<li>within the limits or confines of any city, town, or village;
<li>in any public assembly;
<li>in any mining, logging, railroad, or other construction camp;
<li>in public conveyance; or
<li>on public highways.
</ol>
``Upon or about one's person'' has been defined by the Idaho courts as 
encompassing the physical carrying of the weapon in clothing or handbags
as well as going about with the weapon in ``close proximity ... readily
accessible for prompt use.'' The test for concealment is whether the weapon
is carried so as not to be discernible by ordinary observation. <p>
Exempt from this provision are:
<ol>
<li>officials of the county, state, or federal government;
<li>peace officers;
<li>guards of any jail;
<li>any officer of any express company on duty. 
<li>court appointed attendants;
<li>employees of the adjutant general and military division of the state where
    military membership is a condition of employment when on duty;
<li>criminal investigators of the attorney general and prosecuting 
    attorney's office, prosecutor's and their deputies;
<li>any person outside the limits of any city, mining, lumbering, logging,
    or railroad camp engaged in lawful hunting, fishing, trapping, or other
    lawful outdoor activity;
<li>any publicly elected Idaho official;
<li>any retired peace officer with ten (10) years of service with the state
    or political subdivision who has been certified by the peace officer
    training standards.
</ol>

Concealed carry permits are issued by a County Sheriff. The Sheriff must issue
the permit within sixty (60) days of the filing of an application by a person,
over 21, who is eligible to purchase a handgun under both state and federal
law. If the applicant does not have a valid Idaho driver's license, or state
identification card, the Sheriff may take ninety (90) days to issue the 
permit. The permit allows concealed carry of a weapon for the purpose of
protection, or while engaged in business, sport, or while traveling. The 
basic license fee is $20.00, but the Sheriff shall require fingerprinting,
in which case an additional fee may be charged. The term of the license is 
four years and it may be renewed for a fee of $12.00 The applicant
may be required to show proficiency with a firearm by completing a 
firearms safety or hunter safety course.<p>
A concealed weapon, even with a permit, cannot be carried while one is 
intoxicated, nor can it be carried into a courthouse, juvenile detention
facility, jail, or public or private school.<p>
It is unlawful to carry an uncased firearm in the field or forests without a
valid hunting license on your person.<p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
Idaho statutes are silent on antique and replica firearms. They are treated as
ordinary firearms for possession and carrying purposes.<p>
 
<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
It is lawful to possess, purchase, or sell a machine gun that is legally
registered and possessed in compliance with all federal laws and 
regulations.<p>

<H2> Miscellaneous Provisions</H2>
It is unlawful to exhibit any firearm in a rude, angry, or threatening manner
in the presence of one or more persons.<p>
It is unlawful to aim a firearm intentionally at another person.<p>
It is unlawful to discharge intentionally any firearm at or toward another
person.<p>
When prohibited by local ordinance or law, it is a misdemeanor to make or 
keep gun powder, nitroglycerin or other highly explosive substances within
a city or town, or to carry such substances through the streets.<p>
It is unlawful to ship a loaded firearm on any common carrier.<p>
It is unlawful to operate a firearm in a ``careless, reckless, or negligent
manner or without due caution and circumspection'' when such operation
results in discharge and injury to any person.<p>
It is unlawful to shoot from or across a public highway.<p>
A person's hunting license may be revoked under the following 
circumstances:
<ol>
<li>His careless handling of a gun causes an accident and injury to any person,
    property, or livestock.
<li>He carelessly injures another human being by gunfire.
<li>He causes accidental injury or death to another person by gunfire and 
    flees or fails to render assistance.
</ol>

or transportation of firearms when carried or transported for purposes not 
prohibited by state law.<p>
