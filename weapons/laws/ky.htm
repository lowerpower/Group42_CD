<H1>Kentucky: State Firearms Laws</H1> (As of March 1994) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by 
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances--Firearms</cite>, 
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<p>

<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>
``All men are by nature, free and equal, and have certain inherent and
inalienable rights, among which may be reckoned: ... 7) The right to bear
arms in defense of themselves and of the state, subject to the power of the
general assembly to enact laws to prevent persons from carrying concealed
weapons.'' Article 1, Section 1, Paragraph 7. <p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun, or handgun.<p>
It is unlawful for a person convicted of a felony to possess, manufacture or 
transport a firearm unless he has been granted a full pardon by the Governor 
or by the President of the United States or has been granted relief by the 
Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the Gun Control Act of 1968.<p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
No state permit is required to purchase a rifle, shotgun, or handgun.<p>

<H2>Carry</H2> 
It is unlawful to carry a concealed firearm ``on or about'' one's person.
This applies to carrying a concealed firearm in one's own premises or
dwelling.<p>
Exempt from this prohibition are police officers, agents and messengers of
express companies when on duty, and U.S. mail carriers on duty.<p>
``Concealed on or about the person'' has been recently defined as ``concealment
in such proximity to the person as to be convenient of access and within
immediate physical reach.'' Kentucky courts consider firearms located under a
driver's seat concealed ``on or about'' the person, and are, therefore,
unlawful. Firearms located in glove compartments, locked or unlocked, are not
considered concealed.<p>
There is no statutory provision for obtaining a license or a permit to carry
a concealed firearm.<p>
It is lawful to carry a loaded rifle or shotgun in a vehicle.<p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
Kentucky statutes are silent on antique and replica firearms. They are treated
as ordinary firearms for possession and carrying purposes.<p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
It is lawful to possess, purchase, or sell a machine gun that is legally 
registered and possessed in compliance with all federal laws and 
regulations.<p>

<H2> Miscellaneous</H2><p>
It is unlawful to ``remove, deface, cover, alter or destroy'' the 
manufacturer's serial number or other mark of identification on any 
firearm.<p>
It is unlawful to possess a firearm that has been defaced. To avoid 
prosecution this offense must be reported to the police immediately.<p>
It is unlawful to shoot any wild animal, protected or unprotected, from an
automobile or any vehicle at any time or place. Boats may be used except 
as prohibited by state or federal regulations.<p>
It is unlawful to shoot across a highway.<p>
No city, county or urban-county government may occupy any part of the field
of regulation of the transfer, ownership, possession, carrying or 
transportation of firearms, ammunition, or components of firearms or 
combination thereof.<p>

<B>Caution:</B> State firearms laws are subject to frequent change. The above
summary is not to be considered as legal advice or a restatement of law. To
determine the applicability of these laws to specific situations which you
may encounter, you are strongly urged to consult a local attorney. <p>
