<H1>Massachusetts: State Firearms Laws</H1> (As of May 1995) <p>

<B>PLEASE NOTE:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968 as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by 
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances -- Firearms</cite>, 
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<p>

<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>
"The people have a right to keep and bear arms for the common defense.
And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not
to be maintained without the consent of the legislature, and the military
power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority,
and be governed by it." Declaration of Rights, Article 17.<p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
A Firearm Identification card (FID) or a license to carry is required to own
or possess a handgun, rifle, shotgun or ammunition. An investigation of the
applicant by the local chief of police or his delegate is required before
the issuance of an FID. There is a $2.00 fee and the FID is valid until
revoked or suspended. <p>
An applicant is entitled to an FID unless he has been convicted of a felony
within the last five years, or has been confined or treated for drug addiction
or habitual drunkenness within the last five years, or has been confined to 
any hospital or institution for mental illness unless he has an affidavit from
a physician stating that he is not disabled in a manner which should prevent 
his possessing a handgun, rifle or shotgun. All aliens and minors under the age
of 15 are prohibited from obtaining a card; but a minor between the ages of 
15 and 18 may obtain an FID with the written permission of his parent or
guardian.<p>
The licensing authority "may not prescribe any other condition" for the 
issuance of an FID. Notice of approval or denial must be given to the 
applicant within 30 days. If denied, the applicant may appeal to the 
District Court for review. <p>
Any person who inherits a rifle, shotgun, or handgun is required to obtain
an FID or license to carry within 180 days if he intends to retain 
possession of the firearm.<p>
The holder of an FID must notify, in writing, the issuing authority and the
Commissioner of Public Safety of any change in his address within thirty
days of such change.<p>
A new resident moving into the state who owns firearms has 60 days in which to 
obtain an FID or a license to carry to make the possession legal in 
Massachusetts. A person may possess but not carry during this 60 day period.<p>
An alien may obtain an "alien permit to possess" from the state Commissioner
of Public Safety which will allow him to possess a rifle or shotgun. These 
permit cards are valid for one year and are issued only to aliens with a U.S.
immigration card. <p>
Exemptions from the FID and licensing requirements are provided for:
<ol>
<li>The temporary holding or firing of a handgun under the supervision of a
    person with a license to carry, or the holding or firing of a rifle or
    shotgun under the supervision of a person with an FID or "where such
    holding or firing is for a lawful purpose."
<li>The use of a rifle or shotgun for hunting or target shooting by a minor
    under the age of 15, provided he is under the immediate supervision of
    a person holding an FID or a license to carry.
<li>Possession by chartered veterans organizations and possession by their
    members when on ceremonial duties.
<li>Possession by museums and institutional collections open to the public,
    provided such firearms are unloaded and secured.
<li>Possession by federally-licensed manufacturers and dealers and their 
    employees when necessary for manufacture, display, storage or testing.
</ol>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
To purchase a rifle, shotgun or ammunition, the buyer must have a license to
carry, or an FID, or proof of exempt status (police, military, etc.) and be
18 years of age or older. <p>
To purchase a handgun, the buyer must have (a) a license to carry, <I>or</I>
(b) a permit to purchase <I>and</I> an FID, <I>or</I> (c) a permit to purchase
<I>and</I> proof of exempt status. <p>
A permit to purchase a handgun is obtained from the Commissioner of Public
Safety or the the local chief of police who has discretion to issue or deny
the permit. The permit costs $2.00 and is valid for 10 days. No permit may 
be issued to a person under the age of 18. The permit is valid for the purchase
of one handgun. <p>
It is a crime to sell, give away, loan or otherwise transfer any rifle, 
shotgun, handgun or ammunition to anyone who is not properly licensed or
otherwise authorized to possess or receive such firearm or ammunition.<p>
A private individual is permitted to sell not more than four firearms (rifles,
shotguns, or handguns) per year unless sold directly to a licensed gun dealer.
He must be properly licensed to possess these firearms and the purchaser
must be properly licensed to buy them. The seller must file a report of the 
sale with the Commissioner of Public Safety within seven days of the sale. 
This report must be on the proper forms provided by the Commissioner and give
all required details regarding the seller, purchaser and the firearm being
transferred, including the caliber, make and serial number and the FID,
license or permit number of the buyer.<p>

<H2>Carry</H2> 
An FID alone does not entitle its holder to carry a handgun outside one's
residence or place of business.<p>
Except while hunting or at a shooting gallery, a person may not carry a 
loaded rifle or shotgun on any public way.<p>
A license is required to carry a handgun. Application forms must be given.
Application must be made to the chief of police, who has discretion, after an
investigation, to issue or deny the license. Fingerprints, photographs and
the payment of a $20 fee are required. The license is valid for five years,
but may be revoked, "for cause ... at the will of the licensing 
authority." <p>
The license to carry allows the holder to purchase, possess or carry an 
unlimited number of handguns. <p>
A license may be issued to an applicant who satisfies the requirements for
obtaining an FID, who appears to the chief of police to be a "suitable
person to be so licensed," and who has "good reason to fear injury to his
person or property." In addition, the applicant must never have been 
convicted of a felony, must be 21 years of age or 18 and have his parent's
permission, and be a U.S. citizen. A license also may be issued for 
"<I>any other proper purpose,</I> including the carrying of firearms for use
in target practice only."<p>
An applicant must be notified of an approval or denial with 40 days of 
submitting an application. In the event a license is denied, revoked, or no
reply has been given within 40 days of submitting an application, the
aggrieved may within 45 days file a petition for review in the district 
court. <p>
Any license holder who moves his residence to another jurisdiction within the
state must within 30 days notify the chief of police who issued the license,
the chief of police in the jurisdiction where he is moving and the state 
Commissioner of Public Safety. Failure to provide such change of address is 
unlawful and may void the license. <p>
It is unlawful for any person licensed to carry a handgun to leave the 
firearm in a vehicle unattended.<p>

<H2>Transportation in a Vehicle</H2> 
A resident may transport a rifle or shotgun provided it is unloaded and he has
an FID.<p> 
A resident may transport a handgun only if he has a license to carry.<p>

<H2>Non-Residents</H2> 
A non-resident may possess a rifle or shotgun in Massachusetts:
<ol>
<li>While hunting and in possession of a valid hunting license.
<li>While on a firing or shooting range.
<li>While traveling in or through Massachusetts if the rifle or shotgun is 
    unloaded and enclosed in a case.
<li>While at a firearms show organized by a "regularly existing gun 
    collector's club or association."
<li>If he has a license or permit to possess any firearm in his home state.
</ol>
To transport or possess a handgun, a non-resident must obtain a temporary
license to carry, good for one year, from the Commissioner of Public
Safety, 1010 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215.  A temporary license
may be issued to a non-resident or alien or person not falling within the 
jurisdiction of a local licensing authority. <p>
A non-resident with a license to carry a handgun issued by his home state
(Provided, that the home state has the same requirements as Massachusetts
for obtaining a license to carry.) may carry a pistol or revolver in
Massachusetts for the purpose of taking part in a competition or exhibition
of handguns, or for hunting provided he has a valid hunting license issued
by Massachusetts or the state of his destination. <p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
An antique firearm is defined as any handgun, rifle or shotgun manufactured
in or before 1898, or any replica thereof which is not designed for firing
fixed ammunition or which uses fixed ammunition no longer manufactured in
the United States and no longer readily available commercially. <p>
An FID card is not required to possess antique and replica firearms in the home
or place of business. A license to carry is required when antique and replica
handguns are being carried outside the home or place of business. Law 
Enforcement officials indicate, however, that a license to carry is also
required to carry antique replica rifles and shotguns outside the home or
place of business. <p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
A machine gun "is a weapon of any description ... from which a number of 
shots or bullets may be rapidly or automatically discharged by one continuous 
activation of the trigger, and includes a submachine gun."<p>
It is unlawful to possess a machine gun without a license. Application is 
made to the local chief of police who, in his discretion, may issue a 
license to any applicant "who is a suitable person to be so licensed" and
is a firearm instructor certified by the criminal justice training
council for instructing police personnel or is a bona fide collector of 
firearms. A license to carry is a prerequisite. <p>

<H2> Miscellaneous Provisions</H2>
Although persons in the military and other peace officers are exempt from the
above requirements, the exemption is applicable only when they are performing 
their official duties or when duly authorized to possess weapons. It is not
applicable for any private or sporting use of such rifles, shotguns, or 
handguns.<p>
Airguns and BB guns are regulated by the above provisions.<p>
Massachusetts has a mandatory sentence of one year's imprisonment for anyone
convicted of <I>illegally</I> possessing a firearm loaded or unloaded. One's
residence or place of business is exempt from the mandatory penalty.<p>
It is unlawful to remove, deface or alter in any manner the serial or 
identification number of a handgun, or knowingly to receive such a handgun. 
Possession of a handgun with an altered or defaced number creates a legal 
presumption that the possessor committed the offense.<p>
Discharge of any firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling is prohibited,
except with the consent of the owner, in defense of life and property,
or at licensed shooting galleries.<p>
In the event of theft, loss or recovery of any firearm, the owner is
required to notify the Commissioner and the issuing authority.<p>
Any person in possession of any firearm is required to exhibit his FID or
license to carry or other proof of lawful possession to a law enforcement
officer upon demand. If the person fails to display a license, he may be
required to surrender his firearm, although he may recover it if he produces
the license within 30 days. <p>

<H2> Additional Provisions for Boston</H2>
In Boston under a vague law it is unlawful to possess,
display, transfer, or receive any shotgun with a capacity exceeding 6
rounds; a semi-automatic rifle with a magazine exceeding 10 rounds; any
SKS, AK47, Uzi, AR-15, Steyr AUG, FN-FAL, and FN-FNC rifle; any semi-automatic 
pistol which is a modification of a proscribed rifle or shotgun; and any
magazine or belt which holds more than 10 rounds.  An ``assault weapons
roster board'' may add additional firearms to the list of so-called 
``assault weapons.'' For owners to continue possession of such firearms
a license/registration must be obtained from the Boston Police 
Commissioner within 90 days of the effective date of the law (12/9/89) or
addition of a firearm to a roster of ``assault weapons.'' Otherwise a 
license/registration cannot be obtained.<p>
The provision shall not apply to possession by nonresidents of Boston at a
sporting or shooting club by one with a Massachusetts license to carry a 
pistol, or while taking part in competition or at a collectors'
exhibit or meeting or traveling to or from such event or while in transit 
through Boston for the purpose of hunting by licensed hunters, provided
that in all cases the ``assault weapon'' is unloaded and packaged and the 
person has a Massachusetts firearm identification card or has a license or 
permit to carry or possess firearms issued by another state. <p> 
A person must be 21 to obtain a license to carry or possess any firearms with
a barrel under 16 inches or a shotgun with a barrel under 18 inches. It is 
unlawful to sell or transfer such firearm to a person under 21 or for a person
under 21 to sell or transfer such firearm. This act shall not apply to 
nonresidents of the city; nonresidents of Massachusetts with a nonresident
Massachusetts carrying license if the firearm is loaded and encased; new
residents or persons released from active duty with the armed forces for
a period of 60 days. <p>

Citation: Massachusetts Statues relating to firearms are: Part 1, Chapter 140,
Sections 121 to 131 I; Part II, Chapter 269, Sections 10 to 12 E. <p>

<B>Note:</B> In this summary, the term "firearm" has been used in its general
sense, i.e., any rifle, shotgun or handgun. However, readers of the 
Massachusetts law should be aware that the term "firearm," when it appears
in the text of the statutes, has a special meaning, being defined as any 
pistol, revolver or other firearm with a barrel of less than 16 inches or a
shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18 inches. <p>

<B>Caution:</B> State firearms laws are subject to frequent change. The above
summary is not to be considered as legal advice or restatement of law. To
determine the applicability of these laws to specific situations which you
may encounter, you are strongly urged to consult a local attorney. <p>
