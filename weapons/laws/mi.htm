<H1>Michigan:  Your State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of March 1994) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by 
consulting the ``State Laws and Published Ordinances--Firearms'', 
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<p>

<H2>State Constitutional Provision on Firearms</H2>
``Every person has a right to keep and bear arms for the defense of himself 
and the state.'' Article I, Section 6. <p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
No state permit is required to possess a rifle or shotgun.<p>
Every person within the state who owns or obtains a handgun, in any manner,
must present the handgun to either the city chief of police or the county 
sheriff of the locality where he resides. A certificate of inspection will 
then be issued containing a description of the handgun inspected and the 
name, description and thumbprint of the possessor. <p>
It is unlawful to possess a firearm in a financial institution, church,
court, school, hospital, theatre, sports arena, or day care center unless
licensed or with permission of the owner or agent. <p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
No permit is required for the purchase of a rifle or shotgun.<p>
No rifle, shotgun, or handgun may be sold to a minor under 18 years of age,
a convicted felon, or a person under indictment. <p>
To purchase a handgun from either a dealer or private individual, the 
buyer must obtain a license to purchase from the chief of police if the
buyer lives in a city, or the county sheriff if he lives in an area without
an organized police department. <p>
The buyer must be 18 years of age, a U.S. citizen, a resident of Michigan,
have no felony conviction, have never been adjudged insane (unless later
restored by court order), and score 70% on a basic pistol safety review
questionnaire. <p> 
The license to purchase must be filled out in triplicate at the time of
purchase. The license shall include a description of the handgun sold and the
and the signatures of both the buyer and seller. The seller may retain one
copy and the buyer retains the other two. After purchase and delivery
of the handgun is completed, the buyer must return the license to purchase
along with the purchased handgun, unloaded and encased or trigger locked,
to the local licensing (law enforcement) authority within 10 days. <p>
The buyer (licensee) will then be issued a Safety Inspection Certificate
(registration) for the handgun. One copy of the license will be held by
the local authority for six years and the remaining copy shall be forwarded
to the Commissioner of State Police. <p>
The license, once issued, becomes void if not used within ten days.<p>

<H2>Carrying</H2> 
It is unlawful to carry a handgun concealed on or about one's person or
concealed or openly in a vehicle without a license.<p>
Exceptions: No license is required when:
<ol>
<li>Carrying a pistol unloaded and in a container in a trunk of a vehicle
    while in possession of a valid Michigan hunting license or proof of 
    valid membership in an organization having pistol shooting range 
    facilities and while going to or from a hunting or target shooting area.
<li>If the vehicle has no trunk, the handgun in the container should ``not
    be readily accessible to the occupants of the vehicle.''
<li>Carrying a pistol unloaded and in a container in the trunk of a vehicle
    from the place of purchase to one's home or place of business, to and
    from  a place of repair, or in moving from one residence or business 
    place to another.
<li>Carrying in one's dwelling house or place of business or on one's own
    land.
<li>Carrying an antique firearm, unloaded and in a container in the trunk of
    a vehicle, while going to or from a hunting or target shooting area or 
    an exhibition or demonstration of antique firearms.
<li>A person is licensed to carry a handgun in another state.
<li>A person is a law enforcement officer.
</ol>
In order to transport or possess rifles and shotguns in a motor vehicle,
Michigan law requires that they be unloaded and be one or more of the 
following: broken down, enclosed in a case, carried in the trunk of the
vehicle, or inaccessible from the interior of the vehicle. <p>

<H2>License to Carry</H2> 
An application for a license to carry must be notarized and include the 
signatures of two references, a letter from the applicant's employer, and
a set of the applicant's fingerprints. <p>
The applicant must submit the completed forms to the chief of police or
the township supervisor for his approval and then forward the forms to
the county clerk.<p>
Final approval must be obtained from the Concealed Weapons Licensing Board,
which will direct the county clerk to issue the license if it determines that
the applicant meets all the requirements. <p>
The applicant must be at least 18 years of age, a U.S. citizen, a 
resident of Michigan for more than six months, have ``good reason to
fear injury to his person or property'' or ``other proper reasons,''
be ``a suitable person to be so licensed,'' have no felony convictions
within the past eight years, and have never been adjudged insane unless
subsequently restored by court order. <p>
The Concealed Weapons Licensing Board determines how long the license
will be valid, but it can be no longer than three years. The fee for 
the license is $10.00. <p>
There are two types of licenses issued: one is restricted and lists the
purposes, circumstances, times or places in which the license is valid;
the other is a general license with no restrictions.<p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
Handguns ``kept solely for the purpose of display, as relics, curios, or 
antiques not made for modern ammunition or permanently deactivated'' are
exempt from the registration and sale provisions. <p>
An antique firearm is defined as:<p>

``(a) A firearm not designed or redesigned for using rimfire or conventional 
centerfire ignition with fixed ammunition and manufactured in or before 1898,
including a matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of 
ignition system or replica thereof, whether actually manufactured before 
or after the year 1898. (b) A firearm using fixed ammunition manufactured
in or before 1898, for which ammunition is no longer manufactured in 
in the United States and is not readily available in the ordinary channels
of commercial trade.'' <p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
It is unlawful to sell, offer for sale, possess or manufacture any machine
gun ``which shoots or is designed to shoot automatically more than one shot
without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger.''<p>
Exceptions are for manufacturers with government contracts and any person
duly licensed to manufacture, sell, or possess any machine gun by 
federal law. <p>

<H2> Miscellaneous Provisions</H2><p>
Michigan provides a two-year mandatory prison term for any felony 
committed by a person carrying or possessing a firearm. This sentence is
in addition to the sentence imposed for committing the felony and must
be served consecutively. The person subject to this provision ``shall not
be eligible for parole or probation during the mandatory term.'' <p>
It is unlawful to willfully alter, remove, or obliterate the serial number,
maker's name, or ``other mark of identity'' on any firearm. <p>
It is unlawful to intentionally point, even without malice, any firearm at 
another person.<p>
It is unlawful to set any spring gun or other device ``operating by the
firing of gunpowder or any other explosive.''<p>
It is unlawful to possess or use any firearm while under the influence of
liquor or any ``exhilarating or stupifying drug.''<p>
It is unlawful to ``recklessly or heedlessly or willfully or wantonly
use, carry, handle or discharge any firearm without due caution and
circumspection for the rights, safety or property of others.'' <p>
Pellet guns are considered firearms in Michigan and thus are regulated by
the above provisions. A pellet gun must be registered and requires a 
license to purchase. In addition, a license to carry must be obtained to
carry concealed or in a vehicle; if it has no serial number, the gun must
be taken to the State Police who will stamp a number on the weapon.<p>
No person under 18 years of age may possess or use a BB gun beyond the yard
of his home unless accompanied by a person over 18.<p>
Units of local government are prohibited from imposing certain restrictions
on firearms and ammunition.<p>
Theft of a firearm must be reported to police within 5 days after 
discovery. <p>

<B>Caution:</B> State firearms laws are subject to frequent change. The above
summary is not to be considered as legal advice or a restatement of law. To
determine the applicability of these laws to specific situations which you
may encounter, you are strongly urged to consult a local attorney. <p>
