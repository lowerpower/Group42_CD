public place or public area without a permit to carry.  It is unlawful to 
engage in activities other than those for which the permit has been issued.<p>

applicant resides or to the county sheriff where there is no such police chief 
where the applicant resides. The police shall then check criminal records, 
histories, and warrant information on the applicant.<p>
No permit to carry shall be granted unless the applicant:
<ol>
<li>Is not a person prohibited from possessing a handgun or semiautomatic
    military-style assault weapon (See 1 to 6 of Possession).

<li>Has an occupation or personal safety hazard requiring a permit to carry.  
</ol>

Failure to deny the application or issue a permit within 21 days of the date

    guard at an adult correctional institution.
</ol>

transported in a motor vehicle, airplane, or snowmobile must be unloaded in 
both barrel and magazine and cased unloaded in a car trunk or rearmost
location of the vehicle.<p>
Except when engaged in lawful hunting or when at a target range operating 
under a permit from the Department of Natural Resources, it is unlawful to be 
in possession of a rifle or shotgun outdoors unless it Is unloaded and either
cased or broken down.<p>
Muzzle-loading rifles and shotguns are considered unloaded even though a 
charge is in the barrel, provided the gun is without a percussion cap or 
powder in the flash pan.<p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 

A handgun or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon may be sold by a 
dealer to a person who (1) presents a handgun transfer or carrying permit, 
or (2) who has undergone a seven-day waiting period and a handgun transfer
report has been filed.<p>
A transfer permit may be obtained at no cost from the police chief of a 
municipality or the county sheriff. The information requested consists of 
name, residence, telephone number, driver's license number or non 
qualification certificate number, sex, birthdate, height, weight, and color of 
eyes, and that the person does not fall into any of the categories listed in 
1 to 6 under Possession.<p>
The police chief or sheriff investigates the applicant and must issue or deny 
the permit within seven days. Grounds 1 to 6 under Possession are the only 
basis for a denial. A transfer permit is good statewide for one year to 
purchase one or more handguns either at one time or at intervals throughout 
the year.<p>
A person without a permit to transfer or carry must utilize a transfer report. 
The transfer report contains the same information required in a permit to 
transfer and must be signed by the transferor and the proposed recipient. The
transferor must deliver the report to the police chief or sheriff no later 
than three days after the date of the agreement to transfer, excluding 
weekends and legal holidays. No fee is charged for the transfer report.<p>
Upon receipt of a transfer report, the police chief or sheriff investigates 
the potential recipient. Grounds 1 to 6 under Possession are the only basis 
for a denial. A handgun or ``assault weapon'' cannot be delivered until seven 
days after the agreement to transfer. The police may waive all or part of the 
seven-day waiting period. At the end of the seven days, the handgun or 
``assault weapon'' may transferred if the transferor hears nothing unfavorable 
from the police.  Additional handguns or ``assault weapons'' may then be
transfered for a 30-day period following the date of delivery of the first 
handgun or ``assault weapon'' between that transferor and recipient without 
the necessity of a transfer report or a seven-day waiting period.<p>
Once a police determination has been made that a handgun or ``assault weapon''
recipient is not prohibited from possessing a handgun or ``assault weapon,''
the recipient may within 30 days after the determination apply to the police
chief or sheriff for a handgun or ``assault weapon'' transfer permit, and the 
permit shall be issued.<p>
A person transferring a handgun or ``assault weapon'' to a person exhibiting 
a handgun or ``assault weapon'' transfer or carrying permit is not required to 
file a handgun or ``assault weapon'' transfer report.  <p>
After a determination has been made that the person receiving a handgun or 
``assault weapon'' is not precluded from possessing one, the person may 
request that no record be kept of the fact that he is the recipient of a 
handgun or ``assault weapon.'' The police chief or sheriff shall sign the 
transfer report and return it to the person receiving the handgun or ``assault 
weapon.'' Thereafter, no government employee or agency shall maintain a record 
of the transfer which identifies the person who received the handgun or 
``assault weapon.''<p>
The requirements of a permit to transfer, permit to carry, or report of 
transfer and a seven-day waiting period do not apply to transfers between 
nondealers or of antique firearms acquired as curiosities or for their 
historical significance or value.<p>
No person shall transfer a handgun or ``assault weapon'' to another who is not
personally known to the transferor unless the proposed recipient presents 
evidence of his identity.<p>
No person who is not personally known to the transferor shall become the 
recipient of a handgun or ``assault weapon'' unless he presents evidence of 
his identity to the transferor.<p>
Each firearm dealer shall display a warning that it is unlawful to store or 
leave a loaded firearm where a child under 14 can obtain access.<p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 

Antique firearm means any firearm, including any pistol, with a matchlock, 
flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system manufactured 
before 1899 and any replica of any firearm described therein if such replica
is not designed or redesigned, made or remade, or intended to fire 
conventional rimfire or centerfire ammunition or uses conventional rimfire or 
centerfire ammunition which is not readily available in the ordinary channels 
of commercial trade.<p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 

A machine gun means ``any firearm designed to discharge, or capable of 
discharging automatically more than once by a single function of the 
trigger.''<p>
The following persons may own or possess a machine gun or machine gun 
conversion kit or trigger activating device increasing the rate of fire to 
that of a machine gun or a shotgun with a barrel less than 18 inches or an 
overall length of less than 26 inches:
<ol>
<li>Law enforcement officers or armed forces personnel for use the course of 
    their duties.
<li>Wardens of institutions for retaining persons convicted or accused of 
    crime, and persons authorized by wardens, for use in the course of their 
    duties.
<li>Persons possessing machine guns or short-barreled shotguns which, although 
    designed as weapons, have been determined by the superintendent of the 
    Bureau of Criminal Apprehension or his delegate by reason of the date of
    manufacture, value, design, or other characteristics to be primarily 
    collectors' items, relics, museum pieces or objects of curiosity, 
    ornaments or keepsakes, and are not likely to be used as weapons.
<li>Manufacturers of ammunition who use and possess machine guns for testing 
    ammunition to be used by law enforcement agencies and correctional 
    facilities.
<li>Federally licensed dealers and manufacturers who use such weapons to train 
    peace officers or sell to law enforcement agencies.
</ol>

A person owning or possessing a machine gun or short-barreled shotgun shall, 
within 10 days after acquiring ownership or possession, file a written report 
with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension showing his name, address, official 
title and position, if any, a full description of the arm, the purpose for 
which it is owned or possessed, and ``such further information as the Bureau 
may reasonably require.''<p>


<H2> Miscellaneous</H2>

It is unlawful for any federally licensed dealer to sell a ``Saturday Night 
Special'' handgun, or for any person to manufacture or assemble it in whole or 
in part.<p>
Such handguns are defined as ``a pistol other than an antique firearm or a 
pistol for which the propelling force is carbon dioxide, air or other vapor, 
or children's pop guns or toys, having a frame, barrel, cylinder, slide or
breechlock:<p>
     ``(a) of any material having a melting point (liquidus)
of less than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, or<p>
     ``(b) of any material having an ultimate tensile
strength of less than 55,000 pounds per square inch, or<p>
     ``(c) of any powdered metal having a density of less
than 7.5 grams per cubic centimeter.''<p>

State law supersedes municipal or county regulation of handguns, transfers, 
possession, or carrying.<p>
It shall be unlawful to take any wild animal by means of discharging any 
firearm thereat from a motor vehicle or airplane or snowmobile. However, 
migratory waterfowl may be taken from a floating craft including those 
propelled by motor, sail and wind, or both, if the motor is shut off and the 
sails are furled, the progress of the craft caused by such propulsion has 
ceased, and the craft is drifting, beached, moored, resting at anchor, or is 
being propelled by paddle, oars or pole. Game Wardens may confiscate firearms
used in unlawful hunting.<p>
