<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>
``That the right of every citizen to keep and bear arms in defense of his
home, person and property, or when lawfully summoned in aid of the civil
power, shall not be questioned; but this shall not justify the wearing of 
concealed weapons.'' Article 1, Section 23.<p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
There are no state licensing requirements for the possession of a rifle or 
shotgun or handgun.<p>
It is unlawful for a convicted felon, a fugitive from justice, an habitually
intoxicated, or drugged person or one who is currently adjudicated mentally
incompetent to possess any concealable firearm (firearms with a barrel
length of less than 16 inches).<p>
It is unlawful to possess, manufacture, transport, repair or sell any machine
gun, rifle of less than 16 inch barrel length, shotgun of less than 18 inch
barrel length, silencer, or explosive bullets unless incident to the 
performance of military duties or if an importer, manufacturer, dealer, or 
collector licensed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The possession of ``metal 
penetrating bullets'' during the commission of a crime is a felony.<p>
It is unlawful to transfer firearm or ammunition to a person who is not 
lawfully entitled to possess such or to a person who is intoxicated.<p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
No state permit is required for the purchase of rifles and shotguns.<p>
To obtain a handgun the buyer must produce a permit to purchase which is 
issued by the sheriff of the county where the applicant resides.<p>
It is unlawful to buy, lease, borrow, exchange receive, sell, give away,
deliver, or otherwise transfer a concealable firearm without a valid permit.<p>
A permit to purchase shall be issued by the sheriff if all the statements
in the application are true, and the applicant:
<ol>
<li>is at least 21, a citizen of the U.S. and has resided in the state for
    at least 6 months;
<li>has not been convicted of or currently charged with or indicted for a
    crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;
<li>is not a fugitive from justice;
<li>has not been dishonorably discharged from the U.S. armed forces;
<li>is not habitually in an intoxicated or drugged condition; and 
<li>is not currently adjudged mentally incompetent and has not been committed 
    to a mental health facility.
</ol>
The sheriff shall issue the permit within 7 days. The permit shall contain the
date of issuance, the name and address of the buyer, the nature of the 
transaction and a physical description of the applicant. The permit fee is not
to exceed $10.00 and the permit is valid for only 30 days after the date of 
issuance.<p>
If the permit is used, the seller shall return it to the sheriff within 30 days
after its expiration, with a notation showing the date and manner of 
disposition and a description of the firearm, including the make, model and
serial number. The sheriff shall keep a record of all permit applications
and shall preserve all returned permits.<p>
If the applicant is refused a permit, such refusal shall be in writing setting
forth the reasons for denial and explaining the applicant's right to appeal. 
The denied applicant shall have the right of appeal by filing with the clerk 
of the small claims court within 10 days of receiving the written notice of 
denial.<p>
If, at the court hearing, the applicant shows that he/she is entitled to the
permit, the court shall issue an order to cause the issuance of the permit.<p>
It is unlawful to transport, alter, or change a permit, or to obtain a permit
upon false representation or to use another's permit.<p>

<H2>Carry</H2> 
It is unlawful to carry concealed ``upon or about one's person'' any firearm.
This does not apply to transporting a firearm in a nonfunctioning state or in
an unloaded state when ammunition is not readily accessible, or a person in
his dwelling unit or upon business premises over which he has possession, 
authority or control, or while traveling in a continuous journey peaceably 
through the state. <p>
It is unlawful to carry any firearm openly or concealed into any church or 
assembly place for education, political, literary or social purposes, any 
election precinct on election day, any courtroom while court is in session, 
or any other public assemblage.<p>
It is unlawful to carry any firearm when one is intoxicated.<p>
It is unlawful to exhibit any firearm in a rude or threatening manner in the
presence of one or more persons.<p>

<H2> Antiques</H2>
Antique firearms, defined as ``any firearm not designed or redesigned for
using rim fire or conventional center fire ignition with fixed ammunition and
manufactured in or before 1898 (including matchlock, flintlock, percussion
cap, or similar type of ignition system or replica thereof, whether actually
manufactured before or after the year 1898) and also any firearm using fixed
ammunition manufactured in or before 1898, for which ammunition is no longer
manufactured in the U.S. and is not readily available in the ordinary channels
of commercial trade'' are exempt from the purchase requirements previously
listed. <p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
It is unlawful to ``sell, deliver, transport or have in actual possession or 
control any machine gun.'' This prohibition does not apply to peace officers
or military personnel for their official use, or to an importer, manufacturer,
dealer, or collector pursuant to federal law.  A machine gun is defined as
any firearm ``capable of discharging automatically and continuously loaded
ammunition of any caliber in which ammunition is fed to such gun from or by 
means of clips, disks, drums, belts or other separable mechanical 
device.'' <p>

<H2> Miscellaneous</H2>
A mandatory minimum term of 3 years imprisonment is imposed on a person who
commits a felony with the use or aid of a deadly weapon. The mandatory term is
5 years for a second offense and 10 years for any subsequent offense.<p>
It is unlawful to sell, deliver, loan or barter any firearm to a minor 
without the consent of the parent or guardian.<p>
It is unlawful to deface a firearm or to possess a defaced firearm.<p>
It is unlawful to discharge a firearm while intoxicated, or within one hundred
yards of an occupied school house, courthouse, or church building.<p>
It is unlawful to shoot into a dwelling house, train, boat, motor vehicle or
aircraft, outbuilding, or on, along or across a public highway.<p>
No unit of local government shall adopt any order or ordinance concerning
the sale, purchase, purchase delay, transfer, ownership, use, keeping,
possession, bearing, transportation, licensing, permit, registration, taxation
other than sales and compensating use taxes, or other controls on firearms,
components, ammunition and supplies. Ordinances which regulate the open
carrying of firearms readily capable of lethal use or the discharge of 
firearms within a jurisdiction are not prohibited.<p>
