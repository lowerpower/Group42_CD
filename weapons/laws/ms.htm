<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>
``The right of every citizen to keep and bear arms in defense of his home,

It is unlawful for a person convicted of a felony to possess a firearm, unless 
such person has received a pardon for such felony, has received a relief from 
disability under federal law, or has received a certificate of rehabilitation.
A person may apply to the court in which he was convicted for a certificate of 
rehabilitation.  The court may grant a certificate upon a showing that the
applicant has been rehabilitated and has led a useful, productive and 
law-abiding life since the completion of his sentence and upon the finding that
he will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety.<p>
