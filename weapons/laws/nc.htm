<H1>North Carolina: State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of July, 1994) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by 
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances--Firearms</cite>, 
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<p>

<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>

``A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of
a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed, and, as standing armies in time of
peace are dangerous to liberty, they shall not be
maintained, and the military should be kept under strict
subordination to and governed by the civil power. Nothing
herein shall justify the practice of carrying concealed
weapons, or prevent the General Assembly from enacting penal
statutes against that practice.'' Article 1, Section 30. <p>


<H2>Possession</H2> 

     There are no state licensing requirements to possess a
rifle shotgun, or handgun.<p>
     It is unlawful for any parent or guardian to permit his
child under the age of 12 to possess or use ``any gun,''
except when the child is under their direct supervision. 
(In certain counties, ``any gun'' has been construed to include
air rifles and BB guns.)
It is unlawful for any other person to furnish any firearm
to a child. <p>
     It is unlawful for any person convicted of certain
felonies to purchase, own, have or possess any firearm with
a barrel of less than 18 inches or an overall length of less
than 26 inches, within five years of conviction,
unconditional discharge from a correctional institution, or
termination of a suspended sentence, probation or parole,
whichever is later, unless he has had his rights restored.
This prohibition does not interfere with any person's right
to possess firearms in his home or place of business.<p>
     It is unlawful for any person to manufacture, assemble,
possess, transport, sell, purchase, deliver, or give to
another, any fully automatic firearm, shotgun with a barrel
of less than 18 inches or an overall length of less than 26
inches, rifle with a barrel length of less than 16 inches,
or an overall length of less than 26 inches, any muffler or
silencer for any firearm, or any projectile device, other
than a shotgun, with a bore diameter of more than 1/2 inch.
Excepted are any surplus ordinance sold, loaned or given by
the Secretary of the Army pursuant to Title 10 of the United
States Code or any device which the Secretary of the
Treasury finds is not likely to be used as a weapon, is an
antique, or is a rifle intended to be used solely for
sporting purposes under Title 18 of the United States Code.<p>
     It is unlawful to possess, or carry, whether openly or
concealed, any firearm not used solely for instructional or
officially sanctioned ceremonial purposes in the State
Capitol Building, the Executive Mansion, the Western
Residence of the Governor, or on the grounds of any of these
buildings or in any court. This prohibition shall not apply
to state owned rest areas, rest stops along the highways,
and state owned hunting and fishing reservations and to
members of the armed forces, law enforcement officers and
U.S. civil officers while in the discharge of their official
duties, and members of the militia and national guard when
on duty or called into actual service.<p>
     It is unlawful for any person to possess any firearm in
any public or private school building or bus, campus,
grounds, recreation area, athletic field or other property
used or owned by an educational institution. Excepted are
members of the armed forces, U.S. civil officers and law
enforcement officers while in the discharge of their duties,
members of the militia and National Guard when called into
actual service and private police employed by the
educational institution and for use in a school approved
program. It is unlawful for any person to carry a firearm
into any assembly where a fee has been charged for admission
or where alcoholic beverages are sold and consumed. This
does not apply to the owner or lessee of the premises, a
person participating in the event and carrying a firearm
with the permission of the owner, or a person registered or
hired as a security guard by the owner, lessee, or the
person or organization sponsoring the event.

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
     No state permit is required to purchase a rifle or
shotgun.<p>
     A license or permit must be obtained to purchase, sell
give away, transfer, or receive a handgun by applying to the
county sheriff or the clerk of the Superior Court of the
county in which the purchase is to be made. Antique firearms
and historic, edged weapons are excepted. This does not
apply to a law enforcement officer authorized to carry
firearms, if the purchase is directly related to his/her
official duties.<p>
     The sheriff or the clerk (The issuing authority may be one or the 
other, depending on the county.)  authorized to issue the
license or permit shall issue such license or permit to a
resident of that county, unless the purpose of the license
or permit is for collecting, in which case a license or
permit may be issued to a nonresident when the official
shall have fully satisfied himself by affidavits, oral
evidence, or otherwise, as to the good moral character of
the applicant and that such person desires the possession of
the handgun for (1) the protection of the home, business,
person, family or property, (2) target shooting, (3)
collecting, or (4) hunting. <p>
     For good cause shown, a license or permit may be
denied, and within seven (7) days of such refusal a written
statement of the reason for such refusal shall be issued to
the applicant. <p>
     Each applicant for any such license or permit shall be
informed within thirty (30) days of the date of such
application whether such license or permit shall be granted
or denied, and, if granted, such license or permit shall be
immediately issued to said applicant. <p>
     A permit or license may not be issued to a person (1)
under indictment  or a person who has been convicted of a
felony, other than pertaining to antitrust unfair trade, or
restrain of trade offenses, except that if a person has been
later pardoned or is not prohibited from purchasing a
firearm under the Felony Act, he may obtain a permit or
license, (2) who is a fugitive from justice; (3) who is an
unlawful user of or addicted to a drug, (4) who has been
adjudicated incompetent on the ground of mental illness or
has been committed to any mental institution. An appeal from
such refusal shall lie by way of petition to the Chief Judge
of the District Court for the district in which the
application was filed.<p>
     A permit is valid for the purchase of only one handgun.
To obtain another handgun, an applicant must procure another
permit and must convince the issuing authority that he needs
more than one handgun. The permit is $20.00 payable upon
issuance of the license by the sheriff or clerk.<p>
     The sheriff or clerk shall keep a record of all permits
issued. This record shall contain the name, date, residence,
and age of every licensee. Every dealer who sells pistols
shall keep a record of all such sales.<p>
     At the time of filing annual state tax returns, any
person who owns, possesses or has custody of any handgun
must list the handgun specifically ``as is now required for
listing personal property for taxes.'' In addition, the
person must ``designate his place of residence, including
local street address.''<p>
     A license or permit must be obtained from the Clerk of
the Superior Court to purchase or receive any pistol
suitable for firing blank cartridges.<p>
     It is unlawful to sell, offer for sale, give or dispose
of in any way, a handgun to a minor.<p>
     It is unlawful for person under 18 to possess or carry
a handgun. Any minor in possession of a handgun is guilty of
a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to 6 months,
a fine up to $500.00, or both. This prohibition shall not
apply to officers and enlisted personnel of the Armed Forces
of the U.S. when in discharge of their official duties or
acting under orders requiring them to carry handguns, for
educational or recreational purposes while supervised by an
adult who is present, an emancipated minor who possess such
handgun inside his or her residence, and possession while
hunting or trapping with written permission from a parent,
guardian or other person standing in loco parentis.<p>


<H2>Carry</H2> 
     It is unlawful to ``carry concealed about one's person''*
a handgun, or ``other deadly weapon of like kind,'' except on
one's own premises.<p>
     There is no provision in North Carolina law for
issuance of a permit to carry a concealed weapon.<p>
     It shall be unlawful for any person participating in,
affiliated with, or present as a spectator at any parade,
funeral procession, picket line, or demonstration upon any
public place owned or under the control of the state or any
of its political sub divisions to willfully or intentionally
possess or have immediate access to any firearm. This
prohibition shall not apply to persons authorized by law to
carry dangerous weapons in the performance of their duties
or any person who obtains a permit to carry a firearm at a
parade, funeral procession, picket line, or demonstration
from the sheriff or police chief of the locality where such
activity is to take place. It is unlawful for any person to
transport or possess any ``dangerous weapon'' in any area
under a declared state of emergency or in the immediate
vicinity of a riot. <p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 

     Antique firearms are exempt from the requirement listed
above under ``PURCHASE.'' An antique is defined as one
``manufactured in or before 1898 (including any matchlock,
flintlock, percussion cap or similar early- type of ignition
system) or replica thereof, whether actually manufactured
before or after the year 1898; and also any firearm using
fixed ammunition manufactured in or before 1898, for which
ammunition is no longer manufactured in the United States
and is not readily available in the ordinary channels of
commercial trade.''<p>



<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 

     It is unlawful for any person to ``manufacture, sell,
give away, dispose of, use or possess'' an automatic weapon.<p>
     Excepted from this prohibition are:
<ol>
<li>Banks, merchants, and recognized business
establishments for use in their respective places of
business, provided they apply for and obtain a license from
the clerk or sheriff for the possession of a machine gun to
defend their business.
<li>Members of the United States Army and law
enforcement officers while discharging official duties, and
members of the militia and State guard when called into
actual service.
<li>Any resident of the state who owns a war ``relic or
souvenir'' and reports its presence to the clerk and sheriff
and keeps the machine gun on his own property.
</ol>


<H2> Miscellaneous </H2><p>

     Anyone convicted of robbery or attempted robbery with
the use of any firearm shall be guilty of a felony and must
serve a minimum of five years in prison. <p>
     It is unlawful to hunt on Sunday with any rifle,
shotgun or handgun. <p>
     It is unlawful to point a gun, whether loaded or not at
any person. Anyone who commits an assault with a firearm or
any other deadly weapon upon any law enforcement officer,
fireman, or medical emergency personnel shall be guilty of a
class 1 felony. <p>
     It is unlawful to teach or demonstrate the use of
firearms knowing or having reason to know or intending that
firearms will be used in a civil disorder or in furtherance
thereof, or assembly with other persons for the purpose of
training with or practicing with or being instructed in the
use of firearms in furtherance of a civil disorder.<p>
     It is unlawful for any person to possess, transport,
receive, transfer, manufacture or import ``any Teflon-coated
bullet''. <p>
     Any person who resides in the same premises as a person
under 18, owns or possesses a firearm, and stores or leaves
the firearm in a condition that the firearm can be
discharged and in a manner that the person knew or should
have known that an unsupervised minor would be able to gain
access to the firearm, is guilty of a misdemeanor if a minor
gains access to the firearm without the lawful permission of
the minor's parents or guardian. This prohibition does not
apply if the minor obtained the firearm as a result of an
unlawful entry by any person. <p>
     Any retail or wholesale store that sells firearms shall
conspicuously post at each purchase counter the following
warning in block letters not less than one inch in height
the phrase: <B>``IT IS UNLAWFUL TO STORE A FIREARM THAT CAN BE
DISCHARGED IN A MANNER THAT A REASONABLE PERSON SHOULD KNOW
IS ACCESSIBLE TO A MINOR.''</B> <p>

summary is not to be considered as legal advice or a restatement of law. To
