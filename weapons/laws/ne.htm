of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details

<H2>State Constitutional Provision</H2>
``All persons ... have certain ... rights, among these are ... the right to 
keep and bear arms for security or defense of self, family, home, and others, 
and for lawful common defense, hunting, recreational use, and all other lawful 
purposes, and such rights shall not be denied or infringed by the state or any 
subdivision thereof.'' (Article 1, Section 1).<p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
No state permit is required to possess a rifle or shotgun.<p>
It is unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a felony or who is a 
fugitive from justice to possess ``any firearm with a barrel less than eighteen
inches in length.'' <p>
It is unlawful for any person under 18 to possess a handgun ``or any other form
of short-barreled hand firearm.'' Exempt from this prohibition are persons 
temporarily loaned such firearms ``for instruction under the immediate
supervision of a parent or guardian or adult instructor.''<p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
To purchase, lease, rent or receive a handgun, a transfer certificate is 
required. The certificate is not required if the transfer is between a person 
and his spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, uncle, aunt, nephew, or
niece, or temporary transfer at an established shooting facility or where the 
transferee remains in the line of sight of the transferor.<p>
Application for the certificate may be made in person or by mail with the 
sheriff or police chief of the applicant's place of residence. A background 
check is conducted within 2 days. A certificate shall be issued if the 
applicant is 21 or older and is not prohibited by federal law from purchasing 
or possessing a handgun. The fee is $5.00 and the certificate is valid for 3 
years to purchase any number of handguns. No civil liability shall arise to any
law enforcement agency that complies with the statute.<p>
A person may appeal to the county court in his place of residence within 10 
days of receipt of notice of a denial, revocation, or failure to issue a 
certificate within 2 days of application. The filing fee is $10.00 and the 
court must issue its decision within 30 days of the filing of the appeal.<p>
Handgun shall mean any firearm with a barrel less than sixteen inches in length
or any firearm designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand.<p>
Any person desiring to purchase, lease, rent, or receive transfer of a handgun 
shall apply with the chief of police or sheriff of the applicant's place of 
residence for a certificate. Person must be 21 years of age and not prohibited 
from purchasing or possessing a handgun according to federal law. A fee of 
$5.00 shall be charged for a criminal history record check. The certificate is 
valid for 3 years throughout the state.<p>
Upon receipt of application, the chief of police or sheriff shall issue a 
certificate or deny a certificate and furnish the applicant the specific 
reasons for the denial in writing within 2 days. Any person denied a 
certificate, revoked, or who has not been issued a certificate upon expiration 
of the two-day period may appeal within 10 days of receipt of the denial or 
revocation to the county court of the county of the applicant's place of 
residence. The applicant shall file with the court the specific reasons for the
denial or revocation by the chief of police or sheriff and a filing fee of 
$10.00 in lieu of any other filing fee required by law. The court shall issue 
its decision within 30 days of the filing of the appeal.<p>
No importer, manufacturer, or dealer shall sell or deliver any handgun to 
another person, other than a licensed importer, manufacturer, dealer, or 
collector, until he has inspected a valid certificate issued to such person,
inspected a valid identification containing a photograph of such person, 
obtained a completed consent form from the potential buyer or transferee, which
form shall be established by the Nebraska State Patrol and provided by the
licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer, and after January 1, 1995, received
approval from the Nebraska State Patrol by means of a toll-free telephone call.
The fee for the instant check shall be $3.00. The instant check may be used in 
place of the permit. Exempt from the instant check are importers, 
manufacturers, collectors, and dealers.  Exempt from the permit requirement is 
a transfer between a person's spouse, sibling, parent, child, aunt, uncle, 
niece, nephew or grandparent.<p>
It is unlawful to knowingly and intentionally to sell, provide, loan, deliver, 
or in any other way transfer the possession of a firearm to a person under 18 
years of age or attempt the same. This shall not apply to the transfer of a
firearm, other than a handgun or short-barreled hand firearm, from a relative 
within the second degree of consanguinity or affinity if the transfer of 
physical possession of such firearm does not occur until such time as express 
permission has been obtained from the person's parent or guardian, for a 
legitimate and lawful shooting purpose; or who is under direct adult 
supervision in an appropriate educational program.<p>

<H2>Carrying</H2> 
It is unlawful to ``carry'' a firearm ``concealed on or about the person.''<p>
It is an affirmative defense that the accused was, at the time of carrying, 
engaged in any lawful business, calling or employment, and the circumstances in
which such person was placed at the time were such as to justify a prudent 
person in carrying concealed for the defense of his person, property or 
family.<p>
There is no statutory provision for obtaining a license or permit to carry a 
concealed handgun.<p>
To be considered concealed a handgun must be out of sight and readily 
accessible. Handguns in a closed glove compartment are considered readily 
accessible; however, a handgun in a locked glove compartment is generally
considered not readily accessible.<p>
Shotguns in a vehicle must be unloaded in chamber and magazine.<p>
Any firearm carried in a snowmobile must be unloaded and cased.<p>
It is unlawful to carry or possess a firearm in a game preserve, refuge or 
sanctuary. An exception is made for transporting firearms by road through the 
game preserve, refuge or sanctuary, provided the firearms are unloaded and
cased or not readily accessible.<p>


<H2>Antiques &amp; Replicas</H2> 
Antique handgun or pistol shall mean any handgun or pistol, including those 
with a matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition 
system, manufactured in or before 1898 and any replica of such a handgun or 
pistol if such replica is not designed or redesigned for using rimfire or 
conventional centerfire fixed ammunition or uses rimfire or conventional 
centerfire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United 
States and which is not readily available in the ordinary channels of 
commercial trade. A permit or instant check is not required to acquire an 
antique handgun.<p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
A machine gun is any firearm that shoots automatically more than one shot, 
without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.<p>
State law allows the possession and sale of machine guns provided that federal 
law is complied with.<p>

<H2>Miscellaneous</H2><p>
It is unlawful to ``knowingly'' possess, receive, sell, or lease ``any 
firearm'' from which the manufacturer's identification mark or serial number 
has been removed, defaced, altered, or destroyed.<p>
It is also unlawful to ``intentionally'' remove, deface, cover, alter, or 
destroy the manufacturer's identification mark or serial number or other 
distinguishing numbers on ``any firearm.''<p>
It is unlawful to shoot from a vehicle, or shoot across or from a public 
road.<p>
It is unlawful to possess a firearm in a school, on school grounds, in a 
school-owned vehicle, or at a school-sponsored activity or athletic event. This
shall not apply to members of the armed forces, peace officers or other duly 
authorized law enforcement officers when on duty or training, firearms which 
may lawfully be possessed by the person receiving instruction, for instruction 
under the immediate supervision of an adult instructor, or firearms contained 
within a private vehicle operated by a non-student adult which are not loaded 
and are encased or are in a locked firearm rack that is on a motor vehicle.<p>
Dealers of firearms shall distribute to all purchasers information developed 
by the Department of Health regarding the dangers of leaving loaded firearms 
unattended around children.<p>
