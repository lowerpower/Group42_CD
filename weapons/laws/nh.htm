and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968 as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details

<H2>State Constitutional Provision on Firearms</H2>
"All persons have the right to keep and bear arms in defense of themselves, 
their families, their property, and the state."  Part 1, Article 2-a<p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
There are no state licensing requirements for the possession of rifles,
shotguns or handguns.<p> 
It is unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a felony to own,
possess or control any firearm. <p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
There are no state licensing requirements for the purchase of any rifle,
shotgun or handgun.<p>
It is unlawful to sell any firearm to:
<ol>
<li>Any convicted felon;
<li>To sell or give a handgun to a minor, unless the gift is from a parent,
    guardian or executor to a child, ward or heir.
</ol>
The purchaser must present clear evidence of his identity to the seller.
In the case of a non-dealer transaction, the purchaser must be personally
known to the seller. <p>
The purchaser must sign and deliver to the dealer a statement containing
his full name, address and nationality, the date of sale and the caliber,
make, model and serial number of the handgun to be purchased. Within
seven days the seller must send one copy to the mayor or chief of police 
and must retain the other copy for one year. <p>

<H2>Carry</H2> 
It is unlawful to carry a loaded handgun in any vehicle or concealed about
one's person without a license. Exceptions to the above prohibition are:
<ol>
<li>Carrying one's dwelling, house or place of business.
<li>Law enforcement and military personnel when on duty.
<li>Organizations authorized by law to purchase or receive firearms.
</ol>
A person shall not knowingly carry or have in his control any firearm in a 
courtroom or area used by a court.  This shall not apply to authorized
persons, police officers, and security guards. <p>
A person may carry a handgun openly upon his person or unloaded and exposed
or locked up in a vehicle without a license to carry. <p>
To obtain a license to carry, a person must apply to the selectmen or mayor
or chief of police of the town where he is a resident. The selectmen or mayor
or chief of police shall issue a license to the applicant authorizing him
to carry a handgun if:
<ol>
<li>The applicant has good reason to fear an injury to his 
    person or property; or
<li>Has any other "proper purpose" (such as hunting or target shooting); and
<li>He is a suitable person to be licensed.
</ol>
The fee for the license is $10.00 and the license is valid for not more than
four years. The license shall be in duplicate with one copy held by the 
licensee and one copy held by the issuing officer.<p>
The license must be issued within 14 days of application. If the application
is denied the reasons for the denial must be stated in writing and delivered
to the applicant. <p>
A non-resident may obtain a license to carry by applying to the 
director of state police. He must meet the requirements as outlined above 
and pay a fee of $20.<p>
It is unlawful to carry a loaded rifle or shotgun in or on any motor vehicle,
power boat or airplane.<p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
Antiques, defined as any handgun "utilizing an early type of ignition,"
such as flintlocks, percussion and pin fires, are exempt from the above
regulations. No handgun which utilizes center-fire or rim-fire 
cartridges will be considered an antique. <p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
In the absence of any state law governing automatic weapons, Federal law
controls the registration and regulation of machine guns in New Hampshire.<p>

<H2> Miscellaneous</H2>
It is unlawful to change, alter, remove or obliterate the name of the maker,
model, serial number or other mark of identification on any handgun.
Possession of a handgun with its marks altered creates a legal presumption
that the possessor committed the offense. <p>
It is unlawful to discharge a firearm on the land of another within 300 feet
of a permanently occupied building without the permission of the owner. <p>
It is unlawful to discharge a firearm from or across a public highway,
including the rights of way of a highway, in pursuit of wild birds or 
animals. <p> 
A person who commits or attempts to commit any felony when armed with any
firearm shall be guilty of a class B felony and of a class A felony for any
subsequent offense.  A person convicted of the felonious use of a firearm 
shall, in addition to the punishment for the underlying felony, be given a 
minimum mandatory sentence of 1 year for a first offense and 3 years for any 
subsequent offense. Neither the whole nor any part of such additional sentence 
shall be suspended nor served concurrently with any other sentence.<p>
A person who uses or attempts to use Teflon coated or armor-piercing or
exploding ammunition in the course of any misdemeanor or felony shall be
guilty of a separate felony. <p>


<B>Caution:</B> State firearms laws are subject to frequent change. The above
summary is not to be considered as legal advice or restatement of law. To
determine the applicability of these laws to specific situations which you
may encounter, you are strongly urged to consult a local attorney. <p>
