of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by

closed and fastened case, gunbox, securely tied package, or

circumstances'' from any place of purchase to his residence
or place of business, between one place of business or
residence and another when moving, or between his dwelling
or place of business and place where such firearms are
repaired, for the purpose of repair.
<li>To transport such firearms as necessary for target
practice, in the manner described in paragraph (2) above, by a
member of a gun club organized in accordance with the rules
prescribed by the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle
Practice in going to or from a place of target practice,
provided the club has filed a copy of its charter with the

of its members to the superintendent.
<li> To transport any firearm, in the manner described in
paragraph (2) above, while traveling:
<ol>
<li>Directly to or from any place for the purpose of

reasonable safety regulations as the superintendent may
promulgate.
</ol>

county prosecutor of the county where the out-of-state
officer is engaged in official duties has been notified.
</ol>

     The FID requirement for rifles and shotguns does not
apply to ``antique firearms, provided that such antique
firearms are unloaded or are being fired for the purposes
for exhibition or demonstration at an authorized target
range or in such other manner as has been approved in
writing by the chief law enforcement officer of the
municipality in which the exhibition or demonstration is
held.''<p>
     It is unlawful to knowingly possess any firearm* in or
upon any part of the buildings or grounds of any school,
college, university or other educational institution without
the written authorization of the governing officer of the
institution, irrespective of whether the person possesses a
valid permit to carry the firearm or a valid firearms
purchaser identification card. This prohibition does not
apply to persons listed in paragraphs (7) to (11) above.<p>

     No person under 18 shall possess, carry, fire, or use a
firearm except under the following circumstances:
<ol>
<li> In the actual presence or under the direct
supervision of a parent or guardian, or some other person
who holds a Permit to Carry or FID; or
<li> For the purpose of military drill under the auspices
of a legally recognized military organization and under
competent supervision: or
<li> For the purpose of competition or target practice on
a firing range approved by the governing body of the
municipality in which the range is located or the National
Rifle Association and which is under competent supervision
at the time of such supervision or target practice; or
<li> For the purpose of hunting during the regularly
designated hunting season, provided he possesses a valid
hunting license and has successfully completed a hunter's
safety course.
</ol>

     No person may possess, control, own, or purchase any
firearm if he has:
<ol>
<li>Been convicted of aggravated assault, arson,
burglary, escape, extortion, homicide, kidnapping, robbery,
sexual assault, or any weapons offense.
<li> Ever been committed for a mental disorder to any
hospital, mental institution, or sanitarium unless he
possesses a certificate of a medical doctor or psychiatrist
licensed in New Jersey or other satisfactory proof that he
is no longer suffering from a mental disorder which
interferes with or handicaps him in the handling of a
firearm.
<li> Been convicted for the unlawful use, possession, or
sale of a controlled dangerous substance.
<li> No handgun purchase permit or firearms purchaser
identification card shall be issued to any person who is
subject to a court order pursuant to New Jersey law
prohibiting the person from possessing any firearm.
</ol>

     It is unlawful to knowingly have in one's possession
``any hollow nose or dum-dum bullet.'' Nothing in this
prohibition shall be construed to prevent a person from
keeping such ammunition at his dwelling, premises, or other
land owned or possessed by him, or from carrying such
ammunition from the place of purchase to said dwelling or
land, or while engaged in activities covered by paragraphs
(3), (4), and (5) above under the Exceptions to the Permit to
Carry or FID requirement. Except for a federally licensed
collector, it is unlawful to possess armor piercing
ammunition.<p>


<H2>Purchase</H2> 

<B>Rifles and Shotguns</B><p>

     It is unlawful to sell, give, transfer, assign, or
otherwise dispose of or receive, purchase, or otherwise
acquire a rifle or shotgun, other than an antique rifle or
shotgun, unless the purchaser assignee, donee, receiver, or
holder is licensed as a dealer under New Jersey law or
possesses a valid FID, and first exhibits the FID to the
seller, donor, transferrer, or assignor, and the purchaser
assignee, donee, receiver, or holder signs a written
certification on a form prescribed by the Superintendent of
State Police, which identifies the purchaser, his address
and FID or dealer's number, and states he presently is not
disqualified from purchase. <p>
     The certification shall be retained by the seller, or,
in the case of a person who is not a dealer, it may be filed
with the police chief of the municipality in which he
resides or with the Superintendent of New Jersey State
Police. <p>
     A person shall not be restricted to the number of
rifles or shotguns he may purchase, provided he has a valid
FID and the certification form requirements are met. The FID
is required for private or dealer purchases. <p>

<B>Handguns</B> <p>

     It is unlawful to sell, give, transfer, assign, or
otherwise dispose of, or receive, purchase, or otherwise
acquire a handgun unless the purchaser, assignee, donee,
receiver, or holder is licensed as a dealer under New Jersey
law or has first secured a Permit to Purchase a handgun.<p>
     The permit shall be in the form prescribed by the
Superintendent of State Police and shall be issued to the
applicant in quadruplicate. The applicant prior to the time
he receives the handgun from the seller shall deliver to the
seller the permit in quadruplicate and the seller shall
complete all of the information required on the form. Within
5 days of the date of sale, the seller shall forward the
original copy to the superintendent and the second copy to
the police chief of the municipality in which the purchaser
resides, if the municipality has no police chief, the copy
shall be forwarded to the superintendent. The third copy
shall then be returned to the purchaser and the fourth copy
shall be kept by the seller as a permanent record.<p>
     Only one handgun shall be purchased or delivered on
each permit. A permit is required for private or dealer
purchases.<p>

<B>Requirements for Obtaining Permit to Purchase or FID</B><p>

     The Police Chief of the municipality where the
applicant resides or the Superintendent of State Police, in
all other cases, shall upon application issue to any
qualified applicant a Permit to Purchase or FID.<p>
     The fee for a Permit to Purchase is $2. The fee is
submitted with the application. The Permit to Purchase shall
be valid for 90 days from the date of issuance and may be
renewed by the issuing authority for good cause for an
additional 90 days. The FID fee is $5. It is submitted with
the application. The FID is valid so long as the holder is
eligible to obtain the FID. An additional $26 fingerprint
fee must also be paid.<p>
     The Permit to Purchase or FID shall be granted to a
qualified applicant within 30 days from the date of receipt
of the application for residents and 45 days for nonresident
applicants.<p>
     Applications for a Permit to Purchase or FID shall be
in the form prescribed by the Superintendent of State Police
and shall set forth the name, residence, place of business,
age, date of birth, occupation, sex, and physical
description of the applicant, and shall state whether the
applicant is a citizen, whether an alcoholic, habitual
drunkard, drug dependent person, whether he has ever been
confined or committed to a mental institution or hospital
for treatment or observation of a mental or psychiatric
condition on a temporary, interim, or permanent basis,
whether he has been attended, treated, or observed by any
doctor or psychiatrist or at any hospital or mental
institution on an inpatient or outpatient basis for any
mental or psychiatric condition, whether he presently or
ever has been a member of any organization which advocates
or approves acts of force and violence to overthrow the
government, or which seeks to deny others their
constitutional rights, whether he has ever been ``convicted
of a crime or disorderly persons offense,'' and ``such other
information as the superintendent shall deem necessary for
the proper enforcement of [the gun law].'' First time
applicants must be fingerprinted.<p>
     The applicant shall waive all rights of confidentiality
relating to institutional confinement and shall supply all
necessary information on any mental or psychiatric
treatment. The application shall contain as references two
reputable citizens personally acquainted with the applicant.<p>
     There shall be no conditions or requirements added to
the form or content of the application, or required by the
licensing authority for the issuance of a Permit to Purchase
or FID, other than those that are specifically set forth in
the statute.<p>
     ``No person of good character and good repute in the
community in which he lives, and who is not subject to any
of the disabilities. . . shall be denied a permit to
purchase a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification
card, except as hereinafter set ;.'' <p>

No Permit to Purchase or FID shall be issued to any:
<ol>
<li>Person ``Who has been convicted of a crime.''
<li>Drug dependent person, or person who is confined for
a mental disorder to a hospital, mental institution or
sanitarium, or to a habitual drunkard.
<li>Person who suffers from a physical defect or disease
which would make it unsafe for him to handle firearms, to
any person who has ever been confined for a mental disorder,
or to any alcoholic unless any of the foregoing persons
produce a certificate from a New Jersey licensed medical
doctor or psychiatrist, or other satisfactory proof, that
the applicant is no longer suffering from that particular
disability in such a manner that would interfere with or
handicap him in the handling of firearms.
<li> Person who knowingly falsifies any information on
the application forms.
<li> Person under 18.
<li> ``Person where the issuance would not be in the
interest of the public health, safety, or welfare.''
</ol>

     Any person aggrieved by a denial of a Permit to
Purchase or FID may request a hearing in the Superior Court
of the county in which he resides if he is a resident or in
the Superior Court of the county in which his application
was filed if he is a non-resident. The request for a hearing
shall be made in writing within 30 days of the denial. A
copy of the request shall be served on the police chief of
the applicant's residence, if the applicant is a New Jersey
resident, and upon the Superintendent of State Police in all
cases. A hearing will be held within 30 days of the receipt
of the application for such hearing. No formal pleading and
no filing fee shall be required as a preliminary to such
hearing.<p>


<H2>Carrying</H2>

     It is unlawful to knowingly have in your possession a:
<ol>
<li> Handgun, including any antique handgun, without
first obtaining a Permit to Carry. A Permit to Carry is
required, and no differentiation is made between carrying
openly or concealed.
<li> Rifle or shotgun without first obtaining a FID card.
</ol>
     A game law requires rifles and shotguns to be unloaded
in a vehicle.<p>
     Exceptions: See ``Exceptions'' under POSSESSION.<p>

     Application for Permit to Carry: Application is made to
the police chief where the applicant resides or to the
Superintendent of State Police if the community does not
have a police chief or if the applicant is a nonresident.
The licensing authority makes a recommendation to a judge of
the Superior Court who grants or denies the permit. The
judge may also place restrictions on the permit. The permit
is valid for two years and costs $20.<p>
     The applicant must meet the requirements of the Permit
to Purchase and FID, be fingerprinted, prove his familiarity
with the use of handguns, and have a ``justifiable need to
carry a handgun.''<p>
     A description, including serial number, of every
handgun which the applicant intends to carry must be
provided. Only one permit need be obtained for all such
handguns.<p>
     NOTE: Issuance of the permit is almost completely
discretionary, and New Jersey courts have upheld the policy
of strictly limiting permits ``to persons specifically
employed in security work . . . and to others who can
establish an urgent necessity for carrying guns for
self-protection.''<p>
     Failure to give notice to an applicant within 60 days
shall be deemed to be an approval of the permit. The
procedure for appealing from a denial is the same as
appealing from a denial of a Permit to Purchase or FID.<p>


<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2>

     Antiques are defined as ``any firearm which is incapable
of being fired or discharged, or which does not fire fixed
ammunition regardless of date of manufacture, or which was
manufactured before 1898 for which cartridge ammunition is
not commercially available, and is possessed as a curiosity
or ornament or for its historical significance or value.''<p>
     It is unlawful to possess an imitation firearm under
circumstances that would lead an observer to reasonably
believe that it is possessed for an unlawful purpose.<p>


<H2>Machine Guns</H2>

     A machine gun is defined as ``any firearm, mechanism, or
instrument not requiring that the trigger be pressed for
each shot and having a reservoir belt, or other means of
storing and carrying ammunition which can be loaded into the
firearm, mechanism, or instrument and fired therefrom.''<p>
     Possession, carrying, purchase, or sale of a machine
gun with out a license is prohibited. A license can be
obtained by applying to a judge of the Superior Court where
the applicant resides or, if a nonresident, where he
conducts his business.<p>
     The judge will refer it to the county prosecutor for
investigation and recommendation. A copy of the prosecutor's
report shall be sent to the Superintendent of State Police
and local police chief.<p>
     No license shall be issued unless the applicant would
qualify for a Permit to Carry and the court finds ``that the
public safety and welfare so require.'' The license is valid
for one year, unless otherwise provided by the court. The
court may also attach such conditions and limitations to the
license as it deems to be in the public interest.<p>


<H2>Restricted Firearms</H2>

     New Jersey law restricts the ownership of certain
semi-automatic and other firearms based upon their military
appearance. The list includes: <p>

semi-automatic shotgun with either a magazine capacity
exceeding six rounds, a conspicuous pistol grip, or a
folding stock; a semi-automatic rifle with a fixed magazine
capacity exceeding 15 rounds. Any magazine with a capacity
greater than fifteen rounds is prohibited, even if there is
no semi-automatic firearm to accompany the magazine.<p>
     A part or combination of parts to convert or assemble a
firearm into an "assault firearm" is also forbidden. Any
"assault firearm" not registered, licensed, or rendered
inoperable pursuant to a state police certificate by May 8,
1991, is considered contraband.<p>
     Any "assault firearm" which was not owned prior to May
1, 1990, must be licensed. Application is made to the
Superior Court for the county in which the person lives or
conducts business. The fee is $75. The court must find that
the public safety and welfare require the issuance of the
license and the person must be qualified to obtain a handgun
carrying license. For practical purposes, no one will be
issued such a license.<p>


<H2>Miscellaneous Provisions</H2>

     New Jersey has a mandatory sentence provision for
committing a variety of crimes, such as burglary, robbery,
aggravated and sexual assault, with a firearm or while

However, non-incendiary tracer shotgun ammunition may be
used on trap and skeet ranges for target shooting purposes.<p>
     It is unlawful for any person to deface a firearm, or
to knowingly have in his possession any firearm which has
been defaced, except an antique firearm. To deface means "to
remove, deface, cover, alter, or destroy the name of the
maker, model designation, manufacturer's serial number, or
any other distinguishing identification mark or number."<p>
     Civilians are prohibited from possessing silencers,

be secure; or securely locked with a trigger lock; or under
circumstances where a minor obtained a firearm as a result
