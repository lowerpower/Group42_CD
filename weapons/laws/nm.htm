STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION

     "No law shall abridge the right of the citizen to keep and
bear arms for security and defense, for lawful hunting and
recreational use and for other lawful purposes, but nothing
herein shall be held to permit the carrying of concealed weapons.
No municipality or county shall regulate, in any way, an incident
of the right to keep and bear arms." Article II, Section 6.

POSSESSION

     No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun or
handgun.

     It is unlawful, without prior approval from the bus company,
to board or attempt to board a bus while in possession of a

on the bus. This does not apply to duly elected or appointed law
enforcement officers or commercial security personnel in the
lawful discharge of their duties.

     It is unlawful for a felon to receive, transport, or possess
a firearm.  Felon is defined as "a person who has been convicted
in the preceding ten years by a court of the United States or of
any state or political subdivision thereof to a sentence of death
or one or more years imprisonment and has not been pardoned of
the conviction by the appropriate authority."

     It is unlawful for a person under 19 to possess or transport

organization formed under I.R.S. Code  501(c)(3); (5) traveling

or using a firearm in a negligent manner.

     It is unlawful to discharge a firearm within 150 yards of an
inhabited dwelling or building without the permission of the

     No person under 18 years of age may hunt with a firearm
unless he carries a certificate indicating that he has
successfully completed the New Mexico hunter training course or
the hunter training course of another state which is approved by
the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish.

     No person shall operate a snowmobile having a firearm in his
possession unless it has no round in the chamber, with the action
closed.

     When a finding of fact is made that a firearm was used in a
commission of a felony, the basic sentence for the offense shall
be increased by one (1) year, and the sentence imposed shall be
the first year served and shall not be suspended or deferred. For
a second or subsequent felony in which a firearm is used, the
penalty shall be increased by three (3) years, and the sentence
imposed shall be the first three years served and shall not be
suspended or deferred.
