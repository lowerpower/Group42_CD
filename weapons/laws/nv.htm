unless accompanied by or under the immediate charge of an adult.
It is unlawful to sell to a person under 18 a firearm capable of

pistol or possess any firearm.***

**Firearms capable of being concealed upon the person include all
firearms having barrels less than 12 inches in length.

***A firearm is any weapon with a caliber of .177 or greater
which expels a projectile by means of explosive, spring, gas, air

CARRYING

     It is unlawful to "carry concealed upon the person" a
handgun or other firearm without a permit to carry. A permit may
be obtained from the sheriff of the county where the applicant
resides. Exceptions to this prohibition include:

     1) Sheriffs, constables, marshals, peace officers,
policemen, and special police officers. 
     2) Any person summoned by a peace officer to assist in
making arrests or preserving the peace while actually engaged in
assisting the officer.   
     3) Members of the Armed Forces of the U.S. when on duty.

     It is unlawful to carry a loaded rifle or shotgun in a
vehicle that is being used on a public highway. A firearm is
loaded if there is an unexpended cartridge or shell in the firing
chamber but not when the only cartridges or shells are in the
magazine.

     Carrying an unloaded handgun in the glove compartment is not
considered to be "carrying concealed."

ANTIQUES/REPLICAS

     Nevada statutes are silent on antique and replica firearms.
They are treated as ordinary firearms for possession and carrying
purposes.

MACHINE GUNS

     It is lawful to possess, purchase or sell a machine gun that
is legally registered and possessed in compliance with all
federal laws and regulations.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

     It is unlawful to set any "spring or trap" gun.

     No person may, in the presence of two or more persons, draw
or exhibit a firearm in a "rude, angry or threatening manner" not
in necessary self-defense. It is unlawful to use a firearm in any
fight or quarrel.

     No person may discharge any bullet, projectile, or
ammunition of any kind which is a tracer or incendiary in nature
on any grass, brush, forest or crop covered land.

     It is unlawful to change, alter, or remove or obliterate the
serial number of any firearm. Possession of such a firearm is
prima facie evidence that the possessor has changed, altered,
removed or obliterated the serial number.

     It is unlawful to hunt from an aircraft, helicopter or motor
driven vehicle, including snowmobiles. A paraplegic hunter may
shoot from any stopped motor vehicle which is not parked on the
traveled portion of a public highway.

any federal or state highway or main or general country road.
