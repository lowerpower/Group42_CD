<H1>New York:  Your State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of October 1993) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by 
consulting the ``State Laws and Published Ordinances--Firearms'', 
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<p>

<B>Please Also Note:</B> New York City has comprehensive gun control laws
which further restrict the possession and use of rifles, shotguns and handguns.
For details, please refer to a separate summary of New York City law
prepared by the NRA Institute for Legislative Action.

<H2>State Constitutional Provision on Firearms</H2>
None. However, Section 4 of the New York Civil Rights Law provides: ``A 
well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the 
right of the people to keep and bear arms cannot be infringed.'' <p>

<H2>Possession---Rifles and Shotguns</H2> 
There is no state licensing requirement for the possession of a rifle or
shotgun, although any person convicted of a felony or other serious offense
and any person who ``has been certified not suitable to possess a rifle or
shotgun'' (mentally incompetent) is prohibited from possession. <p>
A person who has  been convicted of a felony or other serious offense may
obtain a certificate of good conduct which will then permit him to possess
rifles and shotguns. <p>
Generally, it is unlawful for anyone under the age of 16 to possess any
firearm; however, a rifle or shotgun may be possessed by a person between
the ages of 12 and 16 who is engaged in supervised target shooting on a 
range. <p>
A minor at least 14 years of age may hunt with any rifle or shotgun, provided
he has a valid hunting license and is accompanied by his parent, guardian
or other parentally-designated adult who also holds a valid hunting license.<p>

<H2>Possession---Handguns</H2> 
A license is needed to possess a handgun in one's home or place of business.
Application is made to the ``licensing officer'' of the city or county where
the applicant resides, is principally employed or where his principal place
of business as a merchant or store keeper is located. <I>(The licensing 
officer in New York City and Nassau County is the Police Commissioner; in 
Suffolk County, the Police Commissioner or Sheriff; elsewhere in the state, 
a county judge or some other designated judge or justice.)</I>  The 
determination whether to grant the license has been held to be completely 
within the discretion of the licensing officer. However, the licensing officer 
must state ``specifically and concisely'' in writing the reasons for such 
denial.  A denial can be overturned in court only if shown to be ``arbitrary 
and capricious.'' <p>
A license may be granted to an applicant who is of good moral character, has
not been convicted of a ``serious offense,'' <I>(This includes misdemeanors and
violations as set forth in Section 256.00, Subd. 17, PL.)</I> states if and 
when he has ever been treated for mental illness and as to whom ``no good 
cause exists for the denial of the license.'' <p>
An investigation will be conducted of all statements required in the 
application. This includes taking the fingerprints and physical descriptive
data of the applicant. One copy of the fingerprints will be forwarded to the
FBI for a search of their criminal records.  The failure or refusal of the
FBI to make the fingerprint check shall not constitute the sole basis for
refusal to issue a permit. <p>
The licensing officer may, in his discretion, add restrictions to the license,
limiting the places where the handgun may be kept or carried. No demonstration
of ``need'' to possess is required to obtain an ``on premises only'' license
valid for one's home or place of business, although ``need'' must be shown
for a license not restricted to one of those locations. <p>
An ``on premises only'' license authorizes the possession of a handgun only at
the location written on the license.  It does not authorize the holder to take
such handgun to any other place. <I>(It should be noted further than an
``on premises only'' license technically does not authorize the holder even
to transport the handgun from its place of purchase to the location stated
on the license.)</I><p>
Applications for licenses must be acted upon within 6 months after presentment.
If there is a delay, there must be written notice to the applicant stating
the reasons. Such delay may be only for ``good cause.''<p>
The statue provides that the failure of the FBI to process fingerprints is
not a good cause for delay. <p>
If issued, the license is valid until revoked, except in New York City,
Nassau and Suffolk counties where the license expires on the first day of
the second January after date of issuance. <p>
The license fee is fixed by the board of supervisors in each county, with
a $10.00 limit prescribed by state law along with a $14.00 state-wide
fingerprint processing fee from the Division of Criminal Justice Services,
and the $14.00 for a federal fingerprint processing fee.  The fee for each
amendment to the license is $3.00 ($5.00 in Suffolk County). In New York
City and Nassau County, the City Council and Board of Supervisors,
respectively, set the license fees without state law limitation. <p>
Each handgun possessed must be listed on the license by make, model, caliber
and serial number. The only exception is possession of a properly
licensed handgun by another licensee at a target range. <p>
Personal information subnitted by the applicant to obtain the license 
becomes a matter of public record. <p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
No permit is required for the purchase of a rifle or shotgun (except in
New York City). <p>
A licensee who moves his residence to another licensing jurisdiction within
the state may, upon request, have his license records transferred to the 
jurisdiction of his new residence. Failure to request transfer of the 
license records may result in an inability to obtain amendments, and 
possible revocation of the license. <p>
To obtain the amendment, the applicant must present his license to the 
licensing officer in the city or county where such license was issued or
where officially transferred.<p>

<H2>Carry</H2> 
A license to possess a handgun serves also as a license to carry unless
restricted.  If there are no restrictions written on the license, the 
licensee is permitted to carry a handgun, loaded or unloaded, concealed, on 
or about his person. <p>
An applicant for a license to carry must be required to show, in addition
to the requirement for possession, that ``proper cause exists'' for the 
issuance of such a license; for example, for target shooting, hunting,
or self-defense. <p>
The license can be amended to include one or more additional or different
handguns.  The licensee is required to carry the license on his person at
all times when carrying a handgun. <p>
Possession of any ``loaded'' rifle or shotgun in a vehicle is illegal. A 
loaded handgun may be carried in a vehicle by a proper licensed individual.
<I>(``Loaded'' means loaded in magazine or chamber. A loaded handgun means
one for which the person possesses ammunition.)</I> <p>

<H2>Non Residents</H2> 
A non resident citizen of the U.S.A. may possess a rifle or shotgun in 
New York, as long as it is unloaded while being transported. <p>
No person may carry, possess or transport a handgun in or through the state
unless he has a valid New York license.  <I>(A provision of federal law
provides a defense to state or local laws which would prohibit the passage
of persons with firearms in interstate travel. If a person is traveling from
any place where he may lawfully possess and transport a firearm to any other
place where he may lawfully possess and transport such firearm and the firearm
is unloaded and in the trunk. In vehicles without a trunk, the unloaded 
firearm shall be in a locked container other than the glove compartment
or console.  Necessary stops, e.g., gasoline and rest, seem permissible.)
</I><p>
A member or coach of an accredited college or university target pistol team
may transport a handgun into or through New York to participate in a 
collegiate, Olympic or target pistol shooting competition provided that
the handgun is unloaded and carried in a locked carrying case and the 
ammunition is carried in a separate locked container. <p>
An alien may possess a rifle or shotgun for use while hunting provided he
has a valid hunting license issued by New York State. An alien may also 
obtain a pistol license.<p>
Non-resident target shooters may enter or pass through New York State with
handguns for the purposes of any NRA approved competition if the competitor
has in his possession a copy of the match program, proof of entry and 
a pistol license from his state of residence.  The handgun must be unloaded
and transported in a locked opaque container. <p>

<H2>Antiques</H2> 
Antique rifles, shotguns and handguns, and replicas thereof, generally are
exempt from the above restrictions and can be bought and possessed without
a permit.  <I>(Persons who shoot muzzle loading handguns must be properly 
licensed.)</I>  Antique handguns must be unloaded and possessed without the 
materials to load same. <p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> It is a felony for any person to manufacture, transport,
or dispose of a machine gun. It is a felony to buy, receive, dispose or
conceal a machine gun which has been defaced for the purpose of concealment.<p>
The presence in any room, dwelling, structure or vehicle of any machine gun
is presumptive evidence of unlawful possession by all persons occupying
the place where the machine gun is found. <p>
A machine gun is defined as any weapon from which a number of shots or bullets
may be rapidly or automatically discharged from a magazine with one 
continuous pull of the trigger and includes a submachine gun. <p>

<H2> Miscellaneous Provisions</H2><p>
It is a crime to possess any rifle, shotgun or handgun in or upon the
building or grounds of any school, college or university in the state 
without the written permission of the institution. <p>
It is a crime to possess a fake or imitation handgun with intent to use
it unlawfully. <p>
It is a crime to intentionally point any firearm toward another person
(except in self-defense), even if no malice is involved. <p>
It is a crime to deface or alter the serial number or any other 
distinguishing number or identification mark on any handgun.  Possession of 
any handgun that has been defaced creates a legal presumption that the 
possessor committed the offense. <p>
The presence of a firearm in a vehicle is presumptive evidence of its
possession by all persons occupying the vehicle except if: the firearm
is found upon the person of one of the occupants; the firearm is found in
a vehicle operated for hire by a duly licensed driver, then the 
presumption will not apply to the driver, or the firearm found is a handgun
and one of the occupants has in his possession a valid license to have and
carry concealed. <p>

<B>Note:</B> In this digest, the word ``firearm'' is used in its general sense,
i.e., any rifle, shotgun, or handgun.  However, readers of the New York law
should be aware that the term ``firearm,'' when it appears in the text of
the statutes, has a special meaning, being applied only to handguns and other 
firearms ``of a size which may be concealed upon the person.'' <p>

<B>Caution:</B> State firearms laws are subject to frequent change. The above
summary is not to be considered as legal advice or restatement of law. To
determine the applicability of these laws to specific situations which you
may encounter, you are strongly urged to consult a local attorney. <p>
