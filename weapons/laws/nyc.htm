<H1>New York City: State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of August 1995) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate 
transportation of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control 
Act of 1968 as amended by the Firearm Owners' Protection 
Act. Also, cities and localities may have their own firearms
ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement
authorities, and by consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published

<H2>Handguns - Possession</H2> 
A license is required to possess a handgun for any purpose. The Commissioner
of the New York City Police Department is the issuing authority for handgun
licenses. <p>
There are different handgun licenses with different privileges granted under
each.  A license for a handgun shall be issued to: (1) have and possess in a
dwelling by a householder; (2) have and possess in his place of business by
a merchant or storekeeper; (3) have and carry concealed for employment
purposes; (4) have and carry concealed, without regard to employment or place
of possession; (5) possess a target handgun; and (6) have, possess, collect
and carry antique pistols. <p>
The applicant for a handgun license must:
<ol>
<li> Be of "good moral character."
<li> Not have been convicted of a felony or a serious offense.
<li> Not have suffered from a mental illness or been hospitalized for 
     mental illness.
<li> Be a person concerning whom "no good cause exists" for the denial of 
     the license.
</ol> <p>

To obtain a handgun license to possess in a household or place of business,
or to possess a target pistol, no showing of need is required.  The 
applicant must meet the eligibility requirements listed above.  The 
application procedure includes fingerprinting and the submission of 2 
photos of the applicant. The non-refundable application fee of all licenses
is $170.00 for the first two years. Licenses may not be issued for more than 3
years and renewals are $170.00 for two years. <p>
Only a licensed handgun owner is allowed to possess 
ammunition suitable for the licensed handgun and is allowed to
possess an ammunition feeding device for the licensed handgun,
but not to exceed 17 rounds capacity. <p>

<H2>Handguns - Purchase</H2>
Approval from the commissioner must be obtained for each handgun purchased
under the license.  The license contains a description of each handgun 
possessed by the license holder. Additional handguns may be added by means
of a Purchase Authorization Coupon and an amendment to the license. <p>

<H2>Handguns - Carrying</H2>
The license to possess a handgun is a license to carry unless restricted, 
but almost all licenses are restricted. If there are no restrictions the 
licensee may carry the handgun concealed on or about his person, loaded or
unloaded. <p>
Handgun licenses issued elsewhere in New York State are not 
valid in New York City. New York City licenses are valid
throughout New York State. However, a New York State License to 
carry or possess will be valid in New York City in the absence of 
a New York City license provided that the handguns are 
transported by the licensee in a locked container and the trip
through New York City is continuous and uninterrupted.<p>
A license to possess a handgun in one's household or place
of business or to possess a target handgun does not authorize the
licensee to carry a handgun on or about his person except in the
very limited circumstances outlined above (under "Possession").
Similarly, a target handgun license does not grant the holder the
right to keep a loaded handgun in his home or place of business.
To do so one must have a license to have and possess either in
one's dwelling or one's place of business.<p>
A "target" license authorizes the holder to transport his
unloaded handgun to and from a shooting range or hunting field in
a locked container.<p>
An "on premises" license permits the holder to possess a
handgun in his home or place of business.  The holder may obtain 2
authorizations a year to transport his handgun(s); unloaded and
in a locked container, to and from an authorized shooting range.<p>
To obtain a license to carry concealed handgun the
applicant is required to show that "proper cause" exists for the
issuance of the license.  The decision to issue or deny this
license is within the discretion of the commissioner and his
decision will only be overturned by a court if it can be shown
that he abused his discretion. <p>
A license may not be transferred. The license holder must
have the license in his possession while carrying a handgun, and
each person licensed to possess a handgun on his premises is
required to have a license on such premises. On demand of any
peace officer a license must be exhibited. <p>

<H2>Rifles and Shotguns - Possession</H2> 
A permit issued by the Firearms Control Section of the
Police Department's License Division is required to possess a
rifle or shotgun in New York City.  The applicant must submit 4
photos taken within 30 days of application, be fingerprinted, and
submit 2 affidavits from persons setting forth his good
character.  The permit is valid for 3 years and is subject to automatic
renewal, upon sworn application, and without investigation,
unless the Police Commissioner has reason to believe that the
status of the applicant has changed since the previous
application.<p>
It is unlawful for a person to possess a rifle or shotgun
unless he is a holder of a permit as well as a certificate of
registration, issued by the Firearms Control Section of the
Police Department's License Division for each rifle or shotgun.
There is no fee for the certificate of registration; the board
keeps a file of all current and past holders of permits and
certificates of registration.<p>
The following persons may not obtain a permit to possess a
rifle or shotgun:<p>
<ol>
<li> Persons under 18.
<li> Convicted felons or those convicted of certain misdemeanors
     unless a certificate of good conduct has been obtained.
<li> Persons not of good moral character.
<li> Persons who have suffered any mental illness or been
     confined to any hospital or institution, public or private, for
     mental illness.
<li> Persons not now free from any mental disorders, defects or
     diseases that would impair the ability to posses or use a rifle
     or shotgun.
<li> Persons for which just cause exists for the denial of the permit.
</ol><p>
     No later that 30 days from the submission of the
application, unless the police commissioner determined more time
is needed for an investigation and then it shall not exceed 60
days, the Commissioner shall issue the permit or shall notify the
applicant of the denial of the application and the reason or
reasons.<p>
     If an application for a permit is denied, the applicant can
submit an appeal to the Police Department's License Division. A
further appeal can be submitted to the Commanding Officer of the
License Division.<p>
     Any person holding a valid license to carry a concealed
weapon in accordance with the provisions of the New York Penal
Law will be issued a shotgun or the rifle permit upon application
and payment of the $55 fee.<p>
The following persons may possess rifles and shotguns without a permit or 
certificate.<p>
<ol>
<li> Persons under 18 when in the actual presence or under the 
     direct supervision of an adult who possess a permit.
<li> Persons in military service.
<li> Peace officers.
<li> Non-residents in transit.
<li> Members of an accredited civilian rifle club who were given rifles 
     obtained through the DCM.
<li> Members of a rifle team representing an educational institution.
<li> Persons transporting rifles and shotguns as merchandise.
<li> Persons who possess antique rifles and shotguns, defined as those 
     manufactured prior to 1894 and replicas which are not designed to fire
     fixed ammunition, or for which fixed ammunition is not commercially 
     available.
<li> Inheritance whether by testamentary bequest or by the laws
     of intestacy, except that the person who receives or acquires
     said rifle or shotgun is subject to obtaining a permit as well as
     a certificate of registration.  If the heir or legatee of the
     owner of such a rifle or shotgun does not qualify to possess the
     rifle or shotgun, the rifle or shot gun may be possessed by the
     heir or legatee for the purpose of sale for a period not
     exceeding 180 days or further limited period beyond the 180 days
     as may be approved by the commissioner, extensions in no event to
     exceed a total of 90 days.
</ol> <p>

Any New York City resident acquiring a rifle or shotgun
outside the city shall make application for a permit and
certificate of registration within 72 hours after bringing such
weapon into the city. Pending the issuance of such permit and/or
certificate the rifle or shotgun must be deposited at the nearest
police precinct.<p>
Non-residents in transit who are carrying rifles and shotguns
with them are exempt from the permit and registration
requirements provided they remain in New York City for only 24
hours and the rifles and shotguns are at all times unloaded and
in a closed case, or in a locked automobile trunk. <p>
Only a rifle or shotgun owner with a permit is allowed to
possess ammunition suitable for the registered rifle or shotgun
and is allowed to possess an ammunition feeding device for the
registered rifle or shotgun, but not to exceed 5 rounds capacity.<p>

<H2>Rifles and Shotguns - Purchase</H2>
The permit to possess a rifle or a shotgun also serves as a
permit to purchase a rifle or a shotgun.<p>
No person lawfully in possession of a rifle or shotgun may
dispose of it except to:<p>
<ol>
<li>A licensed dealer.
<li>The holder of a valid rifle and shotgun permit.
<li>An exempt person such as members of the military, peace
    officers, and non-residents of New York City.
</ol><p>
A non-resident of New York City who has not been issued a
permit may purchase a rifle or shotgun from a licensed New York
City dealer provided that he subscribes and swears or affirms to
a written statement that he would not be disqualified from
purchasing a rifle or shotgun if he were a city resident, that he
is qualified to purchase a rifle or shotgun in the place where he
resides and can document that he is a bona-fide resident of a
jurisdiction outside New York City. Non-resident purchasers have
24 hours to remove any long arms so purchased from New York City,
and in the event the purchaser is traveling to another country
the dealer is authorized to deliver at a terminal to a
representative of the railroad, airline or shipping company for
placement aboard such train, plane, or ship.<p>
There are 3 ways that a rifle or shotgun sale may be
registered with the Firearms Control Section:<p>
<ol>
<li>The New York City dealer who makes the sale is required to 
    register the sale.
<li>The permit holder is required to register his purchase when he buys from
    a dealer outside the city.
<li>In a sale between permit holders the parties involved are
    required to register.
</ol><p>
     Where the sale is made by a city dealer, the dealer issues a
certificate of registration to the buyer and sends a copy to the
Firearms Control Section. In all other dispositions the Firearms
Control Section issues the certificate of registration. The
disposing of the rifle or shotgun must be recorded on forms
supplied by the Firearms Control Section. The original copy must
be sent to the Firearms Control Section within 72 hours of the
purchase or acquisition, and 1 copy will be retained by the
seller and 1 copy by the purchaser or recipient. Both parties
must have their registration certificates amended to show the
addition of the rifle or shotgun.<p>

<H2>Rifles and Shotguns - Carrying</H2>
     It is unlawful for a person to carry a rifle or shotgun on
or about his person or in a vehicle without a permit and
certificate of registration for such rifle or shotgun. A rifle or
shotgun carried in a vehicle must be unloaded and not readily
accessible. Rifles and shotguns carried in an automobile trunk
need not be cased, but they must be unloaded.<p>

     It is unlawful to possess or carry a loaded rifle or shotgun
in public. Unloaded shotguns or rifles carried or possessed in
public must be completely enclosed or contained in a
nontransparent carrying case.<p>

<H2>Antiques &amp; Replicas</H2>
     Exempt from permit and certificate of registration
requirements are antique rifles and shotguns incapable of being
fired or discharged or which do not fire fixed ammunition or
those weapons manufactured prior to 1894 and replicas for which
fixed ammunition is not commercially available.<p>
     Also exempt is "any unloaded muzzle loading pistol or
revolver with a matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar
type of ignition system, or a pistol or revolver which used fixed
cartridges which are no longer available in the ordinary channels
of commercial trade." This includes replicas.<p>

<B>NOTE:</B> A license would be required to possess these handguns when
the ammunition necessary to discharge them is possessed
simultaneously.<p>


<H2> Miscellaneous</H2><p>
It is unlawful to fire or discharge any gun, pistol, rifle,
firing piece or other firearm in the city, except for certain
premises designated by the Police. <p>

Non-residents of New York City may apply for a rifle or
shotgun permit subject to the same conditions, regulations, and
requirements as residents of New York City. <p>

     It is unlawful to possess or dispose of an "assault weapon,"
which is defined as any semiautomatic rifle or shotgun which has
one or more of the following features: folding or telescopic
stock or no stock, conspicuously protruding pistol grip, bayonet
mount, flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to
accommodate a flash suppressor, barrel shroud, grenade launcher,
or modification of such features, or other features determined by
the police commissioner to be suitable for military and not
sporting purposes. The commissioner shall by rule designate
specific semiautomatic rifles or shotguns as "assault weapons."
"Assault weapon" also includes any revolving shotgun or part
intended to convert a rifle or shotgun into an "assault weapon."
"Assault weapon" shall not include any rifle or shotgun modified
to render it permanently inoperative.<p>

     It is unlawful to alter, change, remove, disfigure,
obliterate or deface the name of the maker, model, manufacturer's
or serial number of a rifle, shotgun or assault weapon.<p>
