<H1>Ohio: Your State Firearms Laws</H1> (As of February 1994) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state law, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by 
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances--Firearms</cite>, 
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<p>

*Some municipalities control the possession, sale or transfer of firearms.
Controls include: handgun registration and identification cards; waiting
periods and permits to purchase; restrictions on handguns with barrel lengths
less than 3 inches; prohibition on handguns weighing less than 19 ounces,
costing less than $50 or $90, and able to melt at less than 800&#176;F;
prohibitions on firearms with obliterated markings; and prohibitions on the 
use of any firearm by persons less than 16 or 17 years of age.

<H2>State Constitutional Provision on Firearms</H2>
``The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security; but
standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and shall not be
kept up; and the military shall be in strict subordination to the civil 
power.'' Article 1, Section 4.  <p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
No state permit or license is required to possess a handgun, rifle, or
shotgun. <p>
It is unlawful for the following persons to ``knowingly acquire, have, carry,
or use any firearm:''
<ol>
<li>Fugitives;
<li>Persons indicted for or convicted of a violet felony or adjudicated a 
    juvenile delinquent for a violet felony;
<li>Persons indicted for or convicted of a drug offense, or adjudicated a 
    juvenile delinquent for such an offense.
<li>Alcoholics and drug-dependent persons; and
<li>Adjudicated mental incompetents.
</ol>
Persons disqualified under (2) or (3) of the above may obtain relief from this
disability from the court of common pleas by presenting facts showing fitness 
for relief. <p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
No state permit or license is required to purchase a handgun, rifle, or 
shotgun. <p>
It is unlawful to sell a handgun to a person under 21, or any firearm to a 
person under 18. A firearm may be furnished to a person under 18 for lawful
hunting (persons 16 or over may hunt alone), instruction in firearms safety,
care and handling, or marksmanship under the supervision or control of a 
responsible adult. <p>
It is unlawful to ``recklessly sell, lend, give, or furnish any firearm''
to any person who may not possess a firearm (see possession), or who is
under the influence of alcohol or any drug of abuse.<p>

<H2>Carry</H2> 
It is unlawful to ``knowingly carry or have, concealed on his person or 
concealed ready at hand,'' any firearm. Exempt from this prohibition are:
officers, agents, and employees of a state or the federal government or 
law enforcement officers authorized and acting in the scope of their 
employment. State law permits the carrying of a handgun openly, but many
municipalities prohibit any carrying of firearms. <p>
It is an affirmative defense to a charge of carrying a concealed weapon if
the person was:
<ol>
<li>In his own home;
<li>Engaged in or going to or from his business or occupation which is of such
    character as to justify a ``prudent man in going armed;''
<li>Engaged in lawful activity and had good reason to fear attack on himself
    or family such as to justify a ``prudent man in going armed.''
</ol>

Transporting a firearm in a motor vehicle is unlawful unless the firearm is 
unloaded or is accessible only by leaving the vehicle. <p>
The unloaded firearm must be carried: 
<ul>
<li>In a closed case, box, or package; or
<li>Secured in a rack in plain sight; or
<li>``In plain sight, with the action open or the weapon stripped,'' or if 
    the firearm's action will not stay open or it cannot be easily stripped, 
    in plain sight.
</ul>
Legal authorities recommend that firearms be transported in a case or gun box.
<p> 
A firearm in the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle is considered 
loaded if its magazine is loaded or a loaded magazine is ready at hand.
Muzzleloading weapons are considered unloaded if the percussion cap or
priming powder in the pan is removed. The affirmative defenses under
(2) and (3) are available to a charge brought under the provision of 
carrying in a motor vehicle. Affirmative defenses are generally strictly
construed against the defendant. <p>
State law has no provision for a license or permit for carrying concealed
firearms.<p>
It is unlawful to possess a firearm in any room in which liquor is being
dispensed pursuant to a liquor license. This prohibition does not apply
to a police officer, or to any room used for the accommodation of guests
of a hotel, or the possession of an unloaded rifle by a veterans' 
organization, or possessing or displaying unloaded firearms in a soldiers' 
memorial or in a convention center or other public meeting place by an 
exhibitor, trader, purchaser, or seller. It is an affirmative defense that a
person was not otherwise precluded by law and kept a firearm for defensive
purposes and whose business or occupation was of such character as would
justify a prudent man in going armed, or kept a firearm for defensive 
purposes while engaged in lawful activity and had reasonable cause to fear
a criminal attack as would justify a prudent man in going armed. <p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
Antique and antique replica rifles, shotguns or handguns are treated like 
modern arms for possession, carrying and purchase purposes. <p> 

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
`` `Automatic firearm' means any firearm designed or specifically
adapted to fire a succession of cartridges with a single function of the 
trigger. `Automatic firearm' also means any semi-automatic firearm designed or
specially adapted to fire more than thirty-one cartridges without reloading,
other than a firearm chambering only .22 caliber short, long, or long-rifle
cartridges.'' <p>
It is unlawful to ``knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use'' a machine gun.
Exceptions are:
<ol>
<li>Owners of machine guns registered under the National Firearms Act; or
<li>Autorized state and federal officers, agents, and employees, members of the
    armed forces or organized militia, and law enforcement officers when acting
    within the scope of their duties; or
<li>Licensed importers, manufacturers, and dealers.
</ol>
It is unlawful to negligently fail to take proper precautions to secure a 
machine gun against theft, acquisition or use by an unauthorized or incompetent
person, and to negligently fail to take precautions to insure the safety of
persons and property. <p>

<H2> ``Assault Weapon'' Ordinances</H2>
We are aware of ``assault weapon'' ordinances being enacted in 
Columbus, Dayton, Cleveland and Cincinnati affecting various semi-automatic 
firearms. The Dayton and Cleveland ordinances prohibit the possession of 
semi-automatic center-fire rifles that accept detachable magazines with a 
capacity of 20 rounds or more, and semi-automatic shotguns with a magazine 
capacity of 7 rounds or more.  Excepted are .22 caliber rimfire firearms 
with a detachable magazine of 30 (Dayton) and 18 (Cleveland) rounds 
or less. <p>
The Cincinnati ordinance prohibits the possession of any semi-automatic 
firearm that was "originally designed with or has a fixed magazine or 
detachable magazine with a capacity of more than" 10 rounds for a rifle, 5 
rounds for a shotgun and 15 rounds for a handgun. The Cincinnati ordinance 
also prohibits the possession of any detachable magazine with a magazine 
capacity in excess of 10 rifle rounds, 5 shotgun rounds or 15 handgun rounds. 
The Cincinnati ordinance exempts .22 caliber rimfire rifles which have 
fixed tubular magazines. <p>
The Columbus ordinance prohibits the possession of dozens of specifically named
semi-automatic firearms; other semi-automatic firearms may be added to this
list. The Columbus ordinance also prohibits the possession of any magazine or
other ammunition container which holds more than 20 rounds of ammunition
other than in .22 caliber rimfire. <p>

<H2> Miscellaneous</H2>
It is unlawful to ``knowingly'' discharge a firearm while in or on a 
motor vehicle.<p>
It is unlawful to carry or use any firearm ``while under the influence of
alcohol or any drug of abuse.''<p>
It is unlawful to ``knowingly fail to report to law enforcement authorities
forthwith the loss or theft of any firearm.'' <p>
It is unlawful to discharge a firearm on or across a roadway, or near
buildings. <p>
No person shall knowingly convey, or attempt to convey, any deadly weapon or
dangerous ordnance onto any property owned or controlled by, or to any 
activity held under the auspices of, a board of education of a city, local,
exempted village, or joint vocational school district or of a governing
body of a school. Exempted from the prohibition are: officers, agents, or
employees of this or any other state or the United States, or to law
enforcement officers, authorized to carry deadly weapons or dangerous ordnance
and acting within the scope of their duties, to any security officer employed 
by a board of education or governing body of a school during the time that 
the security officer is on duty pursuant to that contract of employment, or
to any other person who has written authorization from the board of education
or governing body of a school to convey deadly weapons or dangerous ordnance
onto school property or to possess a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance
on school property and who conveys or possesses the deadly weapon or dangerous 
ordnance in accordance with that authorization. <p>

<B>Caution:</B> State firearms laws are subject to frequent change. The above
summary is not to be considered as legal advice or restatement of law. To
determine the applicability of these laws to specific situations which you
may encounter, you are strongly urged to consult a local attorney. <p>
