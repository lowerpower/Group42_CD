All dealers must keep a record of every handgun sold. This record shall contain

and affix his address to the register. Thumbprints are taken. The purchaser 
must be personally known by the dealer or present clear evidence of his

police on the day of the sale for a record check.<p>
The dealer must wait fifteen days from the time of application before 
delivering the handgun to the purchaser. The handgun must be unloaded and
securely wrapped when delivered. The 15 day waiting period does not apply to
a holder of a concealed handgun license or a police officer.<p>
