<H1>Puerto Rico</H1> (1994) <p>

<B>PLEASE NOTE:</B> In addition to territorial laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate
transportation of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of
1968 as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection Act. Also,
cities and localities may have their own firearms ordinances in
addition to federal and territory laws. Details may be obtained
by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances - Firearms</cite>,
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington,
D.C. 20402.<p>

registered mail, within five days following the sale, to the
chief of police of the municipality where he has his business
establishment; he shall send the duplicate within seven days
following the purchase to the Superintendent of Police of Puerto
Rico, and shall keep the triplicate for six years.
