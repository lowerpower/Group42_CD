<H1>South Carolina: Your State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of March 1994) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by 
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances--Firearms</cite>,

<H2>State Constitutional Provision on Firearms</H2>
``A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, 
the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''
Article 1, Section 20. <p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun, or handgun.<p>
It is unlawful for the following persons to possess a handgun:
<ol>
<li>Any person who has been convicted of a crime of violence. (Crime of 
    violence is defined as murder, manslaughter not involving a traffic 
    accident, rape, mayhem, kidnapping, burglary, robbery, housebreaking, 
    assault with intent to kill, rape or rob, assault with a dangerous 
    weapon, or with intent to commit any offense punishable by more than 
   one year.)
<li>Any person who is a ``member of a subversive organization'' (Subversive 
    organization means ``any group, committee, club, league, society, 
    association or combination of individuals the purpose of which, or one of 
    the purposes of which, is the establishment, control, conduct, seizure or 
    overthrow of the government of the United States or any state or political 
    subdivision thereof by the use of force, violence, espionage, sabotage, or 
    threats or attempts of any of the foregoing.''), ``fugitive from justice'',
    ``habitual drunkard'' or ``drug addict'', or who has been ``adjudicated 
    mentally incompetent.''
<li>Any person under 21, but this does not apply to the temporary loan of a 
    handgun for instruction purposes when the minor is under the immediate 
    supervision of a parent or adult instructor.
<li>Any person who ``had been adjudged unfit to carry or possess'' a handgun 
    by an order of a circuit or county court judge.
</ol>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
It is unlawful to transfer in any manner a handgun to any of the above named 
persons.<p>
The purchaser of a handgun must complete an application in triplicate in the 
presence of a dealer. The application contains the applicant's: (1) name; (2) 
residence and business address (3) date and place of birth; (4) social security 
number; (5) S.C. driver's license or Highway Department Identification Card 
Number; (6) physical description; (7) fingerprint card and photograph of 
applicant if applicant does not have a social security number or S.C. driver's 
license number or S.C. Highway Department Identification Number; (8) signed 
sworn statement by the applicant that he is not within any classification that 
would prohibit the applicant from obtaining a handgun by sale, delivery, lease, 
rent, barter, or exchange, and that he has not purchased a pistol within the 
previous thirty days; (9) the signatures of applicant and the dealer; (10) and 
such other personal identifying information as may be required by the State 
Law Enforcement Division. Upon proper completion of the application, the dealer 
submits the original application to the Division, retains a copy for his 
records for a period of three years from the date of the sale or transfer, 
and gives a copy to the applicant.<p>
Handgun purchases from dealers are restricted to one purchase in thirty days. 
If a handgun becomes inoperable or lost, a permit may be secured to buy another 
handgun within the thirty day period. The applicant must submit a sworn 
affidavit to the chief of police or his designated agent of the municipality in 
which the applicant resides or, if the applicant does not reside in a 
municipality, to a county sheriff or his designated agent.<p>
It is unlawful for a dealer to sell or possess a handgun made out of metal with
a melting point under 800&#176;F. Transfers of such handguns between 
qualified persons who are not dealers are lawful. The state handgun transfer 
form used by dealers does not apply to transfers between nonlicensed 
individuals.<p>

<H2>Carry</H2> 
It is unlawful to carry about the person a handgun concealed or unconcealed 
except as follows:
<ol>
<li>Law enforcement officers and prison guards while they are on duty, and 
    guards protecting U.S. property.
<li>Members of the armed forces, reserve forces, National Guard, or State 
    Militia, when on duty.
<li>Members of organizations authorized by law to buy or receive firearms from 
    the United States or South Carolina, or regularly enrolled members of 
    target shooting or firearms collecting clubs while such members are at 
    or going to or from their places of target practice or their shows and 
    exhibits.
<li>Licensed hunters or fishermen while engaged in hunting or fishing and going 
    to and from their places of hunting or fishing.
<li>Persons while possessing, using, or carrying a handgun in the usual or 
    ordinary course of their business involving firearms.
<li>Authorized military or civil organizations and their members while parading 
    or going to and from the places of their respective organizations.
<li>Any person in his home, or upon his real property, or fixed place of 
    business.
<li>Any person in any vehicle where the handgun is secured in a closed glove 
    compartment or closed trunk. The handgun may be loaded.
<li>Any person carrying an unloaded handgun in a secure wrapper from the place 
    of purchase to his home, fixed place of business, or while moving.
<li>Any person who is granted a permit under provision of law by the State Law 
    Enforcement Division and who carries a handgun within the limitations of 
    the permit.
</ol>
The State Law Enforcement Division may issue permits to carry handguns to 
qualified persons whose employment or business exposes them to danger.
(Examples of what the Division considers a job-related necessity would be 
doctors who carry drugs, or diamond salesmen.) The permit specifies the 
conditions under which possession of a handgun is authorized.<p>
An applicant must file a $2,000 surety bond with the Secretary of State as a 
prerequisite to issuance of such permit. An applicant must demonstrate 
proficiency in both the use of handguns and pertinent state laws or complete a 
training course. The training fee is $50. Permits and renewals are valid for 
two years and cost $30. An appeal from a denial of a permit may be taken to 
the circuit court of the county of residence.<p>
The carrying of loaded rifles and shotguns may be limited to certain areas 
during game seasons and is prohibited at all times in certain designated areas.
It is unlawful in any park or facility under the jurisdiction of the S.C. 
Dept. of Parks, Recreation and Tourism to possess any firearm except in areas 
specifically designated for use of firearms. Licensed hunters may have 
firearms in their possession during hunting seasons provided such firearms 
are unloaded and carried in a case or trunk of a vehicle.<p>
Any person convicted of unlawfully carrying a pistol or firearms onto the 
premises of a business which sells alcoholic beverages for consumption on the 
premises shall be subject to an additional penalty of up to 2 years 
imprisonment and/or $2,000 fine.<p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
A machine gun is defined as ``any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or 
can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without 
manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.'' It also includes 
``the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any combination of parts designed 
and intended for use in converting a weapon into a machine gun, and any 
combination of parts from which a machine gun can be assembled if such parts 
are in the possession or under the control of a person.'' <p>
Persons allowed to possess machine guns include members of the armed forces, 
the National Guard, law enforcement officers, railway policemen, and persons 
whose employment involves keeping custody of prisoners. Other persons may 
possess machine guns kept for display as relics and which are rendered 
harmless and not usable. All machine guns, operable or nonoperable, must be 
registered with the State Law Enforcement Division.

<H2>Antiques &amp: Replicas</H2> 
The statutory definition of a pistol does not include ``any firearm generally 
recognized or classified as an antique, curiosity, or collector's item, or any 
that does not fire fixed cartridges.'' It is the policy of the state to use 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms guidelines on classifying 
antiques, curios, collector's items, or handguns not firing fixed cartridges. 
Such firearms are exempt from state purchase requirements mentioned above, but 
law enforcement authorities do not consider antiques exempt from the 
limitations on carrying.<p>

<H2> Miscellaneous</H2><p>
A person who commits or attempts to commit assault with intent to kill, arson, 
armed robbery, burglary, drug trafficking, murder, voluntary manslaughter, 
kidnapping, or criminal sexual conduct while possessing or displaying a firearm 
or what appears to be a firearm shall in addition to the punishment provided 
for the crime be sentenced to a mandatory term of 5 years.<p>
It is unlawful to ``carry or possess any weapon'' in a bus or other public 
transportation vehicle.<p>
No person shall knowingly buy, sell, transport, pawn, receive, or possess any 
stolen handgun or one from which the original serial number has been removed 
or obliterated.<p>
It is unlawful to carry or display firearms in a school or public building or 
areas adjacent thereto without obtaining authorization from a person legally 
responsible for the security of such buildings.<p>
It is unlawful for any person to construct, set, or place a loaded trap gun, 
spring gun, or any like device in any building or in any place.<p>
Resisting arrest with a deadly weapon carries a minimum mandatory sentence of 
6 months for the first offense and 2 years for a second offense.<p>
It is unlawful to ``use, transport, manufacture, possess, distribute, sell, or 
buy any ammunition or shells that are coated with polytetrafluoroethylene 
(teflon).''<p>
