<H1>Texas:  State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of August 1995) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by

<H2>State Constitutional Provision on Firearms</H2>
"Every citizen shall have the right to keep and bear arms in the lawful
defense of himself or the State; but the Legislature shall have power, by
law, to regulate the wearing of arms, with a view to prevent crime."
Article I, Section 23. <p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
No state license is required to possess a rifle, shotgun or handgun. <p>
A person who has been convicted of a felony involving an act of violence
may legally possess a firearm only on his own premises.<p>
It is unlawful to possess, manufacture, transport, repair or sell a rifle
with a barrel less than 16 inches and overall length less than 26 inches
or a shotgun with a barrel less than 18 inches and overall length less than
26 inches. Federal registration of the firearm by the possessor is a 
defense to prosecution under this section. <p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
It is unlawful for any person to sell, rent, loan or give a handgun to any
person if the seller knows that the buyer intends to use it unlawfully.
It is unlawful to knowingly sell, rent, give or offer to sell, rent or give any
firearm to a person under 18 years of age, without the written consent of
his parent or guardian. <p> 
It is unlawful to knowingly or recklessly sell any firearm or ammunition to 
any person who is intoxicated. <p>

<H2>Carry</H2> 

     It is unlawful to intentionally, knowingly or recklessly
carry a handgun on or about one's person, openly or concealed,
without a license to carry a concealed handgun.  Defenses to the
above prohibition are:
<ol>
<li>On one's own premises or premises under his control.
<li>While engaged in lawful hunting, fishing or other sporting
activity including target shooting.
<li>Traveling.
<li>Traveling to and from a range, place of repair or other site
where the type of firearm is normally used, provided the route is
direct and without unreasonable delay.
<li>Peace officers other than a person commissioned by the Texas
State Board of Pharmacy.
</ol>

     Application for a license to carry a handgun concealed is
made to the Department of Public Safety.  The non-refundable
license fee is $140.  The license is valid throughout the state
for 4 years from the date of issuance.  It shall specify if it is
valid for a revolver or semi-auto pistol based on the proficiency
certificate.  The applicant must first apply for the application
material to a handgun dealer, Department of Public Safety, or
other entity or person approved by the Department.  The applicant
receives the application from the Department if he appears to be
qualified for the license. The applicant then must be
fingerprinted; submit photographs of self; present a handgun
proficiency certificate from a qualified handgun instructor,
proof of age (at least 21) and residency in Texas, and
authorization to access noncriminal history records. The
Department "shall issue a license to carry a concealed handgun to
an applicant if the applicant meets all the eligibility
requirements and submits all the application materials." 
Eligibility requirements include no record of convictions for
felonies or certain misdemeanors or mental illness. The
Department must issue or deny the license within 90 days of
receipt of the completed application. After January 1, 1997, it
will be 60 days.  The Department must be notified within 30 days
of a name or address change.<p>

     It is unlawful for a handgun license holder to carry a
handgun onto such places as the premises of a business where
alcohol is consumed, a correctional facility, hospital, an
amusement park, a place of worship, or any meeting of a
governmental entity, or while intoxicated.<p>


<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2> 
Antiques or curio weapons manufactured before 1898 are not considered
firearms and are exempt from regulation. <p> 

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
It is unlawful to possess, manufacture, transport, repair or sell a machine
gun. Federal registration of the machine gun by the possessor is a defense
to prosecution under this section. <p>

<H2> Miscellaneous Provisions</H2><p>
It is a misdemeanor to carry a handgun except with the exceptions listed 
above in "Carry," but it is a felony to carry a handgun onto any
premises licensed to sell or serve alcoholic beverages. <p>
A person who commits a trespass while carrying a deadly weapon will have his 
conviction upgraded to a class A misdemeanor.<p>
It is unlawful to display a firearm in a public place in a manner
calculated to alarm. <p>
It is unlawful to discharge a firearm in a public place or on or across
a public road.<p>
It is unlawful to possess, manufacture, transport, repair, or sell "handgun
ammunition that is designed primarily for the purpose of penetrating
metal or body armor and to be used principally in pistols and revolvers."<p>
A city or town may not adopt regulations relating to the transfer, private
ownership, keeping, transportation, license, or registration of firearm,
