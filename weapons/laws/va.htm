Act of 1968 as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection
Act. Also, cities and localities may have their own firearms
ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement
authorities, and by consulting the State Laws and Published

STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION

"That a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the
people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense
of a free state, therefore, the right of the people to keep and
bear arms shall not be infringed; that standing armies, in time
of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; and that in
all cases the military should be under strict subordination to,
and governed by, the civil power." Article 1, Section 13.

PURCHASE AND POSSESSION

     A criminal history record information check is required
prior to purchasing any firearm, except for an antique or its
replica.  A fee of $2.00 will be collected for such a check. If
any buyer or transferee is denied the right to purchase a
firearm, he may exercise his right of access to and review of the
criminal history record information, provided such action is
initiated within thirty days of the denial.  For non-residents it
is $5.00. A licensed firearm dealer shall not deliver a rifle or
shotgun to a nonresident until an approval report is received
from that state police or 10 days have gone by, whichever comes
first. Except for a dealer, a person whose handgun is stolen or
irretrievably lost, or has a purchase certificate from the state
police, or is exchanging one handgun for another, it is unlawful
to purchase more than 1 handgun within any 30-day period.
     No state permit is required to otherwise purchase or possess
a rifle, shotgun or handgun, although many Virginia cities and
counties individually regulate the purchase and possession of
firearms. These ordinances vary considerably, and it is strongly
recommended that local law enforcement authorities be contacted
for details.
     It is a crime for any person to sell, give or otherwise
furnish a handgun to a minor if he has reason to believe that the
buyer or recipient is under 18 years of age, unless such transfer
is made between family members or for the purpose of engaging in
a sporting event or activity. A person under 18 shall not possess
or transport a handgun or assault firearm.* This prohibition does
not apply to a minor in his own home or on his property or on the
property of another with prior permission, while accompanied by
an adult while hunting, at a range or firearm educational class,
and while transporting an unloaded firearm to and from such
activities.
     It is unlawful for a person convicted of a felony, or any
person under 29 with a juvenile conviction, as a 14-year-old or
older, which would be a felony if committed by an adult, or a
person acquitted by reason of insanity and committed to a mental
institution, to possess or transport a firearm. It is unlawful
for any person who is subject to a protective order issued
pursuant to family abuse or stalking to purchase or transport any
firearm while the order is in effect.  It is unlawful for anyone
adjudicated legally incompetent or mentally incapacitated or
involuntarily committed to purchase, possess or transport a
firearm.  It is unlawful to transfer a firearm to such persons.
     It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to authorize a
child under the age of twelve to use a firearm except when the
child is under the supervision of an adult.
     It is unlawful to possess, sell, transfer, or import any
semi-automatic folding stock shotgun with a spring tension drum
magazine capable of holding 12 rounds.
     A non-citizen or alien not admitted for permanent residence
shall not possess or transport an assault firearm, and a gun
dealer shall not transfer it to such person. In this case
shotguns are not included in the term assault firearm.

CARRYING

     The carrying of any concealed firearm by a person "about his
person, hid from common observation" is prohibited.
     Exceptions to this prohibition include:
1.   carrying in one's place of abode or the curtilage thereof.
2.   any regularly enrolled member of a target shooting
organization who is at, or going to or from, an established
shooting range, provided that the weapons are unloaded and
securely wrapped while being transported.
3.   any regularly enrolled member of a weapons collection
organization who is at, or going to or from, a bona fide weapons
exhibition, provided the weapons are unloaded and securely
wrapped while being transported.
4.   any person carrying such weapons between his place of abode
and a place of purchase or repair, provided the weapons are
unloaded and securely wrapped while being transported.
5.   any person actually engaged in lawful hunting under
inclement weather conditions necessitating temporary protection
of his firearm.
     To be considered "about his person," the concealed weapon
must be "readily accessible for use or surprise if desired." Some
Virginia authorities advise that a handgun carried in the glove
compartment of a car is not considered "readily accessible."** 
The law is not completely clear on this point, however, and the
reader is cautioned that interpretation by local law enforcement
officials may vary.
     A person 21 years of age or older may apply in writing to
the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the county or city in which the
applicant resides for a 2 year permit to carry a concealed
handgun.  The application shall be made under oath, before a
notary or other person qualified to take oaths, and shall be made
on a form prescribed by the Supreme Court, requiring only that
information necessary to determine eligibility for the permit. 
The fee shall not exceed $50.The court shall issue the permit
within 45 days of receipt of the completed application unless it
appears that the applicant is disqualified.  A disqualified
person includes one who is ineligible to purchase, transport, or
possess a firearm; a person who it is alleged, in a sworn written
statement submitted to the court, that in the opinion of such
sheriff, chief of police or attorney for the Commonwealth is
likely to use a weapon unlawfully or negligently to endanger
others based upon personal knowledge or upon the sworn written
statement of a competent person having personal knowledge; a
habitual drunkard or an addict or unlawful user of a controlled
substance; dishonorably discharged from the U.S. armed forces; an
illegal alien; or a person who in the preceding 3 years has been
convicted of drunkenness or violent misdemeanor.  Any  permit
issued prior to July 1, 1996, shall be issued within ninety days
of receipt of the completed application. The court may require
proof that the applicant has demonstrated competence with a
handgun. Proof includes completion of a firearm training course
offered by the NRA, the state, or a school; participation in
organized shooting competition or military service; previously
held a firearm carrying license.  If applicant is renewing a
concealed weapons permit, upon application, a new 2-year permit
shall be issued unless there is good cause shown for refusing to
reissue a permit.   The permit shall contain the name, address,
date of birth, gender, social security number, height, weight,
color of hair, eyes, and signature of the permittee and judge
issuing the permit, and the expiration date.  The person issued
the permit shall have such permit on his person at all times when
he is carrying a concealed handgun and must display the permit
and proper photo identification upon demand by a lawenforcement
officer.  
     The specific reasons for a denial shall be stated in the
order of the court. Upon request of the applicant made within 10
days of the denial, the court shall place the matter on the
docket for a full hearing, at which the applicant may be
represented by a lawyer. The final order of the court shall
include findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
     Within 30 days of a denial, a petition for review may be
filed with the Court of Appeals.
     It is unlawful to carry any firearm during school hours in
any elementary, junior high, or high school, or on such school
property or discharge a firearm on school grounds or within 1,000
feet of school property, except as part of the curriculum or
other school-sponsored program of any organization permitted by
the school.
     Various cities and counties throughout the state have
ordinances prohibiting the transportation of firearms in
automobiles unless they are unloaded and/or enclosed in a case.
     In a city with a population of 160,000 or more it is
unlawful to carry on or about the person on any public road,
alley, right-of-way, park, or any place of whatever nature that
is open to the public a loaded semi-automatic rifle or pistol
equipped with a magazine which will hold more than twenty rounds
of ammunition or designed by the manufacturer to accommodate a
silencer or equipped with a folding stock or shotgun with a
magazine which will hold more than seven rounds of the longest

weapons and 16 inches for rifled weapons. Weapons of less than
.225 caliber shall not be included."

delivered or from whom it was received.
