<BODY>


<H1>Virgin Islands</H1> (1994) <p>

<B>PLEASE NOTE:</B> In addition to territorial laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate
transportation of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control Act of
1968 as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection Act. Also,
cities and localities may have their own firearms ordinances in
addition to federal and territory laws. Details may be obtained
by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances - Firearms</cite>,
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington,
D.C. 20402.<p>

The National Rifle Association does not publish a summary-of-laws
brochure dealing specifically with the laws of the Territory of
the Virgin Islands.  We have included below the law text of the
section dealing with the Virgin Islands's firearm laws as found
in the <cite>Firearms State Laws and Published Ordinances</cite>, 1994

of those included in this section the prior inspection thereof
and approval therefor by the Commissioner shall be necessary and
he shall render such firearms unless, so that the same may not be
used as such. The Commissioner shall issue a certificate of

pistol, machine gun, or sawed-off shotgun. Possession of any
pistol, machine gun, or sawed-off shotgun upon which any such
mark shall have been changed, altered, removed, or obliterated
shall be prima facie evidence that the possessor has changed,
altered, removed or obliterated the same within the Virgin
Islands: Provided, however, that nothing contained in this
section shall apply to any officer or agent of the United States
or the Government of the Virgin Islands engaged in experimental
