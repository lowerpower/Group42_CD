<H1>Vermont: State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of May 1995) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Federal Gun Control Act of 1968 as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by
consulting the <cite>State Laws and Published Ordinances--Firearms</cite>,
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<p>

<H2>State Constitutional Provision on Firearms</H2>
``That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves
and the State---as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty,
they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict
subordination to and governed by the civil power.'' Chapter 1, Article 16.<p>

<H2>Possession</H2>
No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun, or handgun.<p>
It is unlawful for a child under 16, without consent of his parent or guardian,
to possess or control a handgun.<p>
It is unlawful to possess a zip gun. It is generally agreed that a zip gun is a
crude homemade firearm.<p>

<H2>Purchase</H2>
No permit is required to purchase a rifle, shotgun, or handgun. <p>
Dealers are required to keep a record of all handgun sales, and used handgun
purchases. This record must include the date of the transaction, the marks of
identification of the handgun, including manufacturer's name, caliber, model
and serial number, the purchaser's or seller's name, address, birthplace,
occupation, age, height, weight, and color of eyes and hair.  The purchaser or
seller shall sign his name to the record and the dealer must keep such records
in a book for six years after the date of the last entry and shall permit law
enforcement officers to inspect the book at all reasonable times. <p>
It is unlawful to sell or offer to sell a zip gun.<p>

<H2>Carrying</H2>
It is lawful to carry a firearm openly or concealed provided the firearm
is not carried with the intent or avowed purpose of injuring a fellow man.<p>
It is unlawful to carry a firearm within any state institution or upon the
grounds or lands owned or leased by such institution. <p>
It is unlawful for a student to carry or possess a firearm ``upon a school.''
The board of school directors may authorize the use of firearms for
instructional purposes when facilities for such instruction are available.<p>
It is unlawful to carry or possess a loaded rifle or shotgun in or on a motor
vehicle within the right of way of a public highway. Exempt are law enforcement
officers and hunters who are paraplegic or have a ``severe physical
disability'' and have been issued a permit by the fish and game
commissioner.<p>
It is unlawful, without authorization from the court, to carry or
possess a firearm while within a courthouse.<p>

<H2>Antiques and Replicas</H2>
Vermont laws are silent on the subject of antiques and replicas. However, an
opinion of the Attorney General holds that handguns defined as antiques or
replicas under the 1968 Gun Control Act need not be entered in the sales
records as long as they do not fire conventional ammunition. <p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2>
It is lawful to possess, purchase, or sell a machine gun
that is legally registered and possessed in compliance with all federal
laws and regulations. <p>

<H2> Miscellaneous Provisions</H2>
The possession, ownership, transfer, carrying, or registration or licensing
of firearms or ammunition has been preempted by state law.  It is unlawful to
discharge a firearm within land marked as a safety zone without advance
permission of the owner or occupant. <p>

<B>Caution:</B> State firearms laws are subject to frequent change. The above
summary is not to be considered as legal advice or a restatement of law. To
determine the applicability of these laws to specific situations which you
may encounter, you are strongly urged to consult a local attorney. <p>
