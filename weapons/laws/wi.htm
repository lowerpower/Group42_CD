<H1>Wisconsin:  Your State Firearms Laws</H1> (as of March 1994) <p>

<B>Please Note:</B> In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate transportation
of firearms is regulated by the Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by
the Firearm Owners' Protection Act.  Also, cities and localities may have 
their own firearms ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement authorities, and by

<H2>State Constitutional Provision on Firearms</H2>
None.<p>

<H2>Possession</H2> 
No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun, or handgun. It is
unlawful for a minor (a person under 18) to go armed with a handgun or for
any person to sell, lend, or give a handgun to a minor. This does not apply
to target shooting when the minor is under the supervision of an adult.
It is unlawful for any person under 16, unless accompanied by a parent or 
guardian, to have in his possession or control any firearm. Persons between
the ages of 14 and 16 who have a firearms safety certificate are exempt and
may possess a firearm while alone. Those with a safety certificate who are
between 12 and 14 may possess while accompanied by a parent or guardian.<p>
It is unlawful for a person convicted of a felony or found not guilty of
a felony by reason of mental illness to possess a firearm.<p>
It is unlawful in, on, or within 1,000 feet from the grounds of a school
(school zone) to possess a firearm. Exempt are private property not part of 
school grounds, school security guards, law enforcement officers, use in a
program approved by the school, unloaded and in a locked container or in a 
locked firearm rack that is on a motor vehicle, and unloaded and possessed 
while traversing school ground for the purpose of gaining access to lands open 
to hunting if the entry on school grounds is authorized by school 
authorities.<p>

<H2>Purchase</H2> 
A firearm dealer transferring possession of a handgun must: have the 
transferee present identification, complete a notification form, and pay
a $5.00 fee; the information from the form is conveyed to the Wisconsin
Department of Justice for a criminal history record check using a toll free
telephone number; 48 hours must have elapsed from the time that the dealer
has received a confirmation number regarding the criminal history record 
search and the dealer has not been notified that the transfer will be in
violation of law. The dealer shall maintain original records of completed 
notification forms and a record of all confirmation numbers and approval
or nonapproval numbers received regarding criminal history record searches.
The dealer shall mail a copy of each completed notification form to the 
Department of Justice. The department shall destroy all approved records
regarding the criminal history record search within 30 days after 
receiving the duplicate form. Within 3 years after the department issues a 
unique approval number, it shall destroy all corresponding information
contained in the log. <p>
These provisions do not apply to antique handguns, transfers between
wholesale or retail dealers, or to law enforcement or armed service 
agencies. <p>
Every dealer or manufacturer of articles composed, in whole or in part, of
precious metal or stones, copper, lead, or brass, who obtains by purchase
or exchange, any second-hand firearms, must within twenty-four hours after
receiving it report to the chief of police or the county sheriff the fact
that the firearm has been received and a description of the firearm and 
identifying information on the person from whom received.<p>

<H2>Carrying</H2> 
It is unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed with a
``concealed and dangerous weapon.'' (Jury instructions in Wisconsin state
that ``to go armed'' one must have a firearm on one's person or within his
immediate control and availble for use.)  There is no statutory provision 
for obtaining a license or permit to carry a concealed weapon.<p>
It is unlawful to possess, place, or transport in or on any aircraft,
vehicle, or any motor-driven boat while the motor is running, any firearm
unless such firearm is unloaded and cased, and it is also unlawful to 
load or fire any firearm from such aircraft or vehicle. (Except for a duly 
licensed disabled hunter.)<p>
It is unlawful to go armed with a firearm in any building owned or leased
by the state or any political subdivision of the state.<p>
Some game wardens view the carrying of a firearm in the woods without a 
hunting license as hunting without a license.<p>

<H2>Antiques</H2> 
Handguns manufactured in or before 1898, or replicas of such handguns 
which do not use fixed ammunition or which use fixed ammunition no longer
manufactured in the United States and not available in the ordinary
channels of commerce, are considered antiques.<p>

<H2>Machine Guns</H2> 
The definition of a machine gun ``includes a weapon of any description
by whatever name known which was manufactured to discharge more than two
shots or bullets by a single function of the firing device.''<p>
Any person duly authorized by the chief of police of any city or the sheriff
of any county may sell, possess, use, or transport a machine gun. State law
``shall not prohibit or interfere with ... the possession of a machine gun
other than one adapted to use pistol cartridges, for a purpose manifestly
not aggressive or offensive.''<p>

<H2>Miscellaneous</H2>
Firearms kept for personal use are specifically exempt from personal 
property taxation. One gun is also exempt from execution of a judgement.<p>
Municipalities by statute may regulate the use and careless use of 
firearms.<p>
It is unlawful to discharge any firearm ``within 40 rods (640 feet) of any
public park, square or enclosure owned or controlled by any municipality ...
and resorted to for recreation or pleasure, when such park, square or 
enclosure is wholly situated without the limits of such municipality.''<p>
It is unlawful to operate or go armed with a firearm while under the 
influence of an intoxicant. (Jury instructions on this particular section 
of the law require that ``to go armed'' the firearm must be on one's person
or accessible to him and that it be loaded.)<p>
It is unlawful to set a spring gun.<p>
It is unlawful to discharge a firearm while on the lands of another within
100 yards of any building devoted to human occupancy without the express
permission of the owner or occupant. ``Building'' does not include a 
portable unit like a house trailer or tent.<p>
It is unlawful to shoot from or across a highway or within 50 feet of the
center of a roadway.<p>
It is unlawful to discharge a firearm in a school zone. Exempt is private
property not part of school grounds, a school approved shooting program, law
enforcement officers, and school security guards.<p>
It is unlawful to recklessly store or leave a loaded firearm within the 
reach or easy access of a person under 14 who obtains the firearm without
lawful permission and possess or exhibits the firearm in a public place or
discharges the firearm so as to cause bodily harm or death to self or 
another.  In a commercial transfer the buyer or receiver of a firearm shall
be provided with a written warning that it is unlawful to leave a loaded
firearm within the reach or easy access of a child if the child improperly
discharges, possesses or exhibits the firearm.<p>
