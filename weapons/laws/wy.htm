<pre>
WYOMING
(As of August, 1995)

PLEASE NOTE: In addition to state laws, the purchase, sale
and (in certain circumstances) the possession and interstate
transportation of firearms is regulated by the Gun Control
Act of 1968 as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection
Act. Also, cities and localities may have their own firearms
ordinances in addition to federal and state laws. Details
may be obtained by contacting local law enforcement
authorities, and by consulting the State Laws and Published
Ordinances_Firearms, available from the U.S. Government
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.

STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION

     "The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of
themselves and the state shall not be denied." Article 1, Section
24.

POSSESSION

     No state permit is required to possess a rifle, shotgun or
handgun.

     Any person who has previously pleaded guilty to or has been
convicted of a violent felony, unless pardoned, and who uses or
possesses any firearm is guilty of a felony.

PURCHASE

     No state permit is required to purchase a rifle, shotgun or
handgun.
     It is unlawful to sell a handgun to anyone under 21. It is
unlawful to sell, barter, or give cartridges designed for use in
a handgun to anyone under 16.

     A dealer is required to keep a firearms register at his
place of business. This register shall contain the date of
acquisition of any firearm, the name of the seller, the make,
model, caliber and serial number of the firearm, the date of sale
and the purchaser's signature. This register shall be subject "to
inspection by any peace officer at all reasonable times."

CARRYING

     It is unlawful for anyone to "wear or carry" a concealed
handgun without a license to carry.

     The attorney general shall within 60 days after the filing
of an application issue a permit to carry a concealed weapon for
a term of five years. The applicant must be a U.S. citizen, 21
years of age, hold a valid picture identification, and be a
resident of the state for at least 6 months. A permit may not be
denied unless the applicant is ineligible under Wyoming or
federal law to own, possess, or receive a firearm; suffers from a
physical infirmity which prevents the safe handling of a firearm;
has been committed to a facility for the abuse of a controlled
substance; chronically or habitually uses alcoholic beverages to
the extent that the applicant has been committed. A permit may be
denied based on a reasonable cause to believe that the applicant
is mentally ill, defective, or disabled or otherwise may be a
threat to the peace and good order of the community. An applicant
must demonstrate familiarity with a firearm by completion of a
firearm safety course.

     The permit fee or renewal is $50.00. Renewals are filed with
the sheriff. A criminal history record and background check of
the applicant shall be conducted, and a fee may be charged for
fingerprinting. A permit may be revoked or its renewal denied if
circumstances arise that would require refusal to grant the
permittee an original license. The sheriff may at his discretion
issue a concealed firearm permit to an applicant between 18 and
21 years of age who meets the above requirements. Denials and
revocations are subject to appeal to the District Court. Notice
of change of address, loss, or destruction of the permit must be
given within 30 days to the division of criminal investigation.
If a permit is lost or destroyed, upon payment of a $5.00 fee, a
person may obtain a duplicate, upon furnishing a notarized
statement that the permit has been lost or destroyed.

     It is unlawful to carry a concealed firearm into:

     (1) any facility used primarily for law enforcement
operations or administration without the written consent of the
chief administrator;
     (2) any detention facility, prison or jail;
     (3) any courtroom;
     (4) any meeting of a governmental entity;
     (5) any meeting of the legislature or a committee thereof;
     (6) any school, college or professional athletic event not
related to firearms;
     (7) any portion of an establishment licensed to dispense
alcoholic liquor and malt beverages for consumption on the
premises;
     (8) any place where persons are assembled for public
worship;
     (9) any school facility;
     (10) any place where the carrying of firearms is prohibited
by federal law or regulation or state law or regulation.

     Concealed carrying permits from a state agency in another
state are honored.

ANTIQUES AND REPLICAS

     Wyoming statutes are silent on antique and replica firearms.
They are treated as ordinary firearms for possession and carrying
purposes.

MACHINE GUNS

     It is lawful to possess, purchase, or sell a machine gun
that is legally registered and possessed in compliance with all
federal laws and regulations.

     It is unlawful for any person to take into or possess in the
gamefields of the state any fully automatic weapon.

MISCELLANEOUS

     It is unlawful to discharge any firearm "at or toward" any
occupied aircraft, automobile, truck, bus or train.

     It is unlawful to draw, or threaten to use a handgun already
drawn, upon any other person except in defense of one's person or
property.

     The use of firearms is prohibited in all state parks,
campgrounds, recreational grounds, historic landmarks, or
historic sites unless otherwise designated by the state Fish and
Game Commission.

     It is unlawful to fire any firearm from, upon, along or
across any public road or highway.

     It is unlawful to shoot any wildlife except predatory
animals from any flying machine, automotive vehicle, trailer,
motor-propelled vehicle, or vehicle designed for travel over
snow. The state Fish and Game Commission may exempt handicapped
hunters from this provision.

     No city, town, or county shall authorize, regulate or
prohibit the sale, transfer, purchase, delivery, taxation,
manufacture, ownership, transportation, storage, use or
possession of firearms, weapons and ammunition.


CAUTION: State firearms laws are subject to frequent change.
The above summary is not to be considered as legal advice or
a restatement of law. To determine the applicability of
these laws to specific situations which you may encounter,
you are strongly urged to consult a local attorney.
