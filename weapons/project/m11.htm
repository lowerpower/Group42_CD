<h1>The M11/9</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The M12/386 is the same gun as the MAC II, although a few changes exist
to stisfy the BATF that the gun wil remain semi auto.  The M11/9 gets it's
name from the conversion of the former model II, a .380 open bolt selective
fire gun to 9mm semi-automatic.  It should be noted that the M11/9 and the
M12/380 function is identical except that the M11/9 is 9mm and the M12/.380
chambers .380 rounds.
<p>

<h2>Building The M11/9 (and M12/380)</h2>
This document will cover the construction of the lower receiver only
since M11/9 and M12/380 parts kits are avalable from MAC, RPB and/or
Cobray (see sources or look in Shotgun News.)  The lower Receiver
is the only part of this gun that the BATF considers a <i>gun</i> so
all the other parts may be sold without forms or waiting periods.  It
should be noted that unformed, unwelded lower receiver blanks are
also available fro various companies.
