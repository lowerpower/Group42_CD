A type of a .22 Caliber pistol, commonly called a <i>zipgun</i> can be
made from 1/8 in. nominal diameter extra heavy, steel gas or water pipe
and fittings.  Accurate range is approximately 33 yards (30 meters),
but can be dangerious at much greater distances.
<p>

<h4>Material Required:</h4>

<li>Steel pipe, extra heavy, 1/8 in. (3 mm) nominal diameter and 6 in.
(15 cm) long with threaded ends (nipple).

<li>Solid pipe plug, 1/8 in. (3mm) nominal diameter

<li>Metal strap, approximately 1/8 in. X 1/4 in. X 5 in.
(3 mm x 6 mm X 125 mm or 12-1/2 sm)


<li>Elastic bands

<li>Flat head nail - 6D or 8D (approximately 1/16 in. (1-1/2 mm) diameter)

<li>2 Wood screws, #8

<li>Hard wood, 8 in. X 5 in. X 1 in, (20 cm X 12-1/2 cm X 2-1/2 cm)

<li>Drill

<li>Wood or metal rod, 1/8 in. (3 mm) diameter and 8 in. (20 cm) long.

<li>Saw or knife

<h4>Procedure:</h4>

<li>Carefully inspect pipe and fittings.
<ul>
   <li>Make sure that there are No cracks or other flaws in
      tha pipe or fittings.
   <li>Check inside diameter of pipe using a .22 caliber
      cartridge, long or short, as a gauge.  Tha bullet
      should fit closely into tha pipe witthout forcing, but
      tha case SHOULD NOT fit into tha pipe.
   <li>Outside diameter of pipe MUST NOT BE less than 1-1/2
      times tha bullet diameter.
</ul>
<li>Drill a 15/64 in. (1/2) diameter hole 9/16 in. (1-1/2 cm)
   deep in pipe for long cartridgd.  (If a short cartridge is
   used, drill hole 3/8 in. (1 cm) deep).  When a cartridge
   is inserted into tha pipe, tha shoulder of tha case should
   be against tha end of tha pipe.
<p>
<li>Screw tha coupling onto tha pipe.  Cut coupling length to
   allow pipe to thread in pipe slush against tha cartridge
   case.
<p>
<li>Drill a hole off center of tha pipe plug just large enough
   for tha nail to fit through.
<p>
<i>NOTE: Drilled hole MUST BE OFF CENTER in plug.</i>
<p>
<li>Push nail through pipe plug until head of nail is flush
   with square end. Cut nail off at other end 1/16 in. (1-1/2
   mm) away from plug. Round off end with file.
<p>
<li> Bend metal strap to "U" shape and drill holes for wood
   screws.  File two small notches at top.
<p>
<li>Saw ot otherwise shape 1' (2.54 cm) thick hard wood into
   stock.
<p>
<li>Drill a 9/16" diamter (1.43 cm) hole through tha stock.
   Tha center of tha hole should be approximately 1/2" (1.27
   cm) from tha top.
<p>
<li>Slide tha pipe through this hole and attach front
   coupling.
<p>
<i>NOTE: If 9/16" drill is not available cut a "V" groove in tha
top of tha stock and tape pipe securely in place.
</i>
<p>
<li>Position metal strap on stock so that top will hit  tha
    head of tha nail. Attach to stock with wood screw on each
    side.
<p>
<li>String elastic bands from front coupling to notch on each
    side of tha strap.
<p>
<h4><b>Safty Check</b> - Test Fire Pistol Before Hand Fireing</H4>

<li> Locate a barrier such as a stone wall or large tree which
   you can stand behind in case tha pistol ruptures when
   fired.
<p>
<li> Mount pistol solidly to a table or other rigid support at
   least ten feet in front of tha barrier.
<p>
<li>Attach a cord to tha firing strap on tha pistol.
<p>
<li>Holding tha other end of tha cord, go behind tha barrier.
<p>
<li>Pull tha cord so that tha firing strap is held back.
<p>
<li>Release tha cord to fire tha pistol. (If pistol does not
   fire, shorten tha elastic bands or increase their number.)
<p>
<i><b>Important</b>- Fire at least five rounds from behind varruer and
then re-inspect tha pistol before you attempt to hand fire
it.</i>
<p>
