<h1>The Sten Gun</h1>
<h4>By Wheats, Group42</h4>

<hr noshade>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

At the beginning of World War II England suffered harshly from the German U-boat campaign. 
Supplies were in short supply. The British had just been pushed out of France and had to be 
evacuated from the northern shores at Dunkirk. Unfortunately, most of their military equipment 
was left behind. Great Britain and most of Europe were being forced into a battle for survival. 
Small arms of any type were extremely scarce, let alone weapons suitable for the defense of a 
nation.

<p>

Enter the 9mm sub-machine gun. The entire Stengun family evolved from a basic design of 
simplicity. It was designed by Reginald V. Shepperd, directory of the Birmingham Small Arms 
Company, and Harold J. Turpin, the principal designer, in conjunction with the Royal Small 
Arms Company at Enfield. The name "Sten" was derived from the first letter of the last name 
of each of the designers and the first two letters from Enfield. The Stengun Mk I went from the 
design phase to production in less than three months. Several changes and improvements 
were made and the famous Mk II design was finalized. The entire family of Stens are noted for 
their outstanding performance and unrefined appearances. By the end of production, over 
2,000,000 Stens had been made at less that $5.00 per copy.

<p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

Due to the simplicity of design large amounts of Stens were made by small job shops. Firms 
with no experience in firearms manufacture began production. Some firms were no more than 
one man with a vise and hand tools. This gives you some idea of the ease of manufacture the 
Sten presented. Hence the reason for this information.

<p>
<h3>
<b>WARNING!!!</b> Actually constructing a working Sten gun will require the advanced 
permission of the B.A.T.F.! Constructing a Sten gun with advanced permission is a 
<b>SEROIUS CRIME!</b>
</h3>
<p>

Of all the many Sten guns that were constructed during the second world war, most of them 
ended up here in the United States. They were stripped of their receivers ( the part the 
B.A.T.F. considers the gun) and are now available from many sources as parts kits. These 
plans will focus on the construction of a new receiver that will work with these parts kits. It is 
very possible to put a fully functional Sten Mk II or Mk III together for much less than $200

<p>
Select a suitable lightwall steel tubing which is commercially available. For example, a fence 
post pipe (galvanized) is 38.5mm OD and 35.0mm ID, most suitable for use as a receiver. 
4130 alloy steel tubing is the preferred tubing to use, referred to as DOM (drawn over 
mandrel), it is known for it's uniform size, wall thickness and smooth interior surface.

<p>

Cut receiver tube to 12.65 inches in length. Then use the enclosed
<a href="stenrec1.gif">template</a> by either gluing
or taping over the blank tube. Make sure at least one end is flush with the tube. Recheck the 
alignment of the template with the blank tube. It is now a simple matter to remove all the 
shaded areas on the template. By using this method, layout time is reduced. This feature 
makes the Sten an ideal project for the handyman with a minimal amount of tools.

<p>

The areas to be removed from the blank are as follows:
<ol type=1>
<li>Recoil spring cap locking notches. These are the small “j” or “l” shaped cuts at what will 
soon be the rear of the receiver.
<li>Bolt or cocking handle slot. This is the long slot that allows the bolt handle to reciprocate. 
This <b>must</b> be straight.
<li>Sear notch opening. This is located on the bottom rear of your receiver. It allows the sear 
to hold the bolt in the open position.
<li>Ejection port. This is the large opening on the right side near the front half of the tube.
<li>Magazine port. Positioned on the left side opposite the ejection port, this opening is for the 
insertion of the magazine.
<li>Magazine housing alignment slot. By allowing the magazine housing to rotate 90 degrees, 
this converts the magazine housing into a dust cover. This is located left, in front of the 
magazine housing itself.
<li>Barrel sleeve latch hole. As the magazine rotates upward toward its’ shooting position, this 
prevents the housing from overtravel.
<li>Ejector slot. The ejector in the parts kit will fit here. This is the slot at the rear of the 
magazine port. Be sure that the installed ejector does not interfere with the travel of the bolt.
</ol>

<p>

<h2>Construction Tips</h2>

<p>

Before making any cuts on the receiver tube, carefully read all of the instructions. The length 
of your Sten is not very critical. Most wartime copies vary in length to some degree. Do, 
however, make sure that the ends are square and true. The single most important cut of all is 
the cocking lever (or both handle slot) be careful to make it straight and square to the ends of 
your tube. To avoid problems, use the template.

<p>

If you are using the template and for whatever reason things don't line up, now is the time to
correct it, not after you have cut metal! Cut the sear hole last. Also, make sure that the slots 
for retaining the butt stock are 180 degrees apart.

<p>

If milling machines and/or drill presses are not available, the entire job can be done with hand 
tools. After laying out the correct cuts and trying on all the parts that fit (without actually 
cutting), you may start. Simply drill a ¼ inch hole in each area to be cut out. By drilling more 
than one hole you can connect the holes using files and a hacksaw. It is best to leave these 
cutouts just a hair on the small side to allow for final fitting.

<p>

Once cuts are made on the receiver blank, try the parts on the tube from time to time. This will 
help guide you along without mistakes. Once the parts are test-fitted and correct you can 
prepare the tube for welding. Welding can be done by any conventional method available. If 
conventional methods are not available, you can also use the brazing method. Brass rod can 
be used but it would be stronger using steel, even a coat hanger will do in place of a brazing 
rod.

<p>

After final assembly and welding is completed, you are ready to hand operate the Sten and 
prepare to test fire. Make sure the sear will engage the bolt. If it does not, runaway gun will 
result.

<p>

To test fire, use only one round at a time in the magazine. The Sten should fire the single 
round and lock the bolt reward in the open position. Check to see that the extractor pulled the 
empty cartridge case free from the barrel. Wear eye and ear protection during this stage.
