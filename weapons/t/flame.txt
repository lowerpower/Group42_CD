           From the book: The Poor Man's James Bond by Kurt Saxon

An excellent little flame thrower can be made, using just about any metal or
plastic hand squirter. The only consideration is that the liquid must come
out in a stream instead of an atomized spray.

Some oil cans shoot a stream 30 feets. Sprayers can often be adjusted from a
spray to a stream. Sprayers of various kinds can be found in auto supply,
garden and grocery stores.

A six-inch tube, usually aluminum or brass, is fitten on the nozzle. A wick
or piece of heavy cloth is wired onto the other end of the tube. The fuel is
gasoline, acetone or lighter fluid.

To use, the tube is tilted downward slightly. The sprayer is squeezed slowly
so the fuel will dribble out and saturate the wick all around.

The wick is then lit and the device is aimed and squeezed. Quick, hard
squeezes will squirt the fuel through the tube and past the burning wick.
The wick ignites the fuel and you have such a dandy weapon you will never
stop bragging! If you have a little brother, he can take it to school for
show and tell.
