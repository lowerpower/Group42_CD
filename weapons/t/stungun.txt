WHAT IS IT ???
--------------

The following plan show how to construct a device, capable of stunning any
moving lifeform on earth.It can be build into a holster.The device produces
an intimidating plasma or lightning like discharge that in most cases 
discourages an encounter.This effect occurs as a visual audible display
between the contacts immediately when power is applied.A physiological
effect requires contact to certain parts of the anatomy to produce the
stunning disabling function.The electrical output energy is small and
usually will not cause any tissue damage.When contact is made to the subject,
he may be stunned and paralysed for up to several minutes.The high voltage
output can penetrate the heaviest of clothing and due to the contact spacing
will deliver highly jamming electrical pulses that will override the
nervous system causing temporary paralysis and loss of voluntary control.
That's why this stun-gun doesn't work on aliens who have no or another
nervous system.Cyborgs and androids however, can be defeated or even
destroyed and send to the eternat space-time-continuum by using this device.

CIRCUIT THEORY
--------------

The circuit consists of 2 basic sections: the inverter 
power supply and the capacitor discharge section.

The inverter section consists of swithching transistors Q1 and Q2
that alternately switches the primary windings of a saturable core
transformer (T1). A high voltage square wave is induced in the secondary of T1
via the switching action and is rectified by diode bridge D3,4,5,6.Base
current drive for Q1 and Q2 is obtained by a tertiary feedback winding on T1
and is applied in the correct phase to turn the appropriatetransistor 'ON'.
This base current is limited by resistor R2. Diodes D1 and D2 provide a
return path for the base current flowing in the opposite transistor
respectively.R1 serves to unbalance the circuit to initiate swithching.A
voltage of approx. 400 volts is obtained in this circuit from a 9.6 volt Nicad 
battery.Higher powered operation may be obtained by increasing to a 12 Volt
battery pack,however, more space is required and care must be taken not to
over rate the components if continued use is anticipated.

The capacitor discharge section consists of 2 opposite phased high voltage
pulse transformers T2,T3 being current pulsed via SCR1 shorting a charged
capacitor C2 across their primaries. C2 and the primary inductance of T2,T3
provides a ringing wave whose negative overshoot commutates SCR1 to turn 'Off'.
It is imporant that this primary inductance be sufficient so when combined with
capacitor C2 allows a ringing frequency with a period considerably larger
than the required commutation turn off time of the SCR1. iode D8 provides
energy recovery of the negative overshoot component of this discharge pulse.
Transformer T2,T3 now force induces 'out of phase' high voltage pulses in
their respective secondaries with a high instantaneous peak current.Diode D7
and R3 limit the DC current to the SCR1 and prevents DC lock on,which also
provides a high impedance to the negative turn 'off' pulse.
SCR1 is triggered by the UJT pulse timing circuit consisting of Q3.Pulse 
repetition rate is determined by capacitor C3 and the charging trimpot R6.
SCR1 switch rate can be adjusted from 1 to 50 pps.Higher pulse rep rates may
have a tendancy to overload the inverter power supply,where it will be unable
to supply the current necessary to charge C2,consequently with its charge
voltage dropping off.
The voltage output is about from 50-100000 volts at a peak current of 1-2 Amps
The energy waveforms consists of a train of 30 microsec pulses decaying 
exponentially.This produces a moderately painful electric shock and is what
causes the temporary jamming of the nervous system but will not electrocute
due to the low average current plus the fact that the current flow is only
across a small section of the body,that is between the contact electrodes.
The peak power of this device is 25000 watts plus.
The outputs of T2 and T3 are the output contacts of the device. T2 and T3 are
phased for different outputs.Now when the switch is pushed,a continuous
sparking occurs between these points producing the visual and audible effect.

About the schematic :

This is the first time that I drew a schematic with AsciI chars. Maybe it
therefore doesn't look 100% professional. However I'm sure that you'll know
what I mean with this schematic.

Some things you need to know :
As i tryed to malke this drawing compatible with most printers,i didn't
use the 'arrow'-char. Therefor the emitter is indicated with an 'e' on Q1 and
Q2.

I preferred to draw the bridge,as bridges are mostly drawn,so I couldn't draw
the diodes as I did with D7. That's why I indicated the Kathode with the letter
'k'.So in this schematic, D3 points up,D4 points down,D4 points down and D6 up.

Assemble as shown.Note position of transistors,polarity of diodes and
capacitors.Nothe that when using the special pc transformer T1,it can be
inserted in two ways.A way to determine the correct position is to measure
the resistance of the two windings and identify 'em.The one with the lower
reading goes toward Q1 and Q2.

Connect up 8 AA Nicads (or whatever).
Connect a voltmeter to point (w). Momentarily press S1 and note a voltage of
approx. 400VDC. If no voltage is present, the circuit must be troubleshot.
If you did your homework well and Murphy's 1st Law 'whatever can go wrong,
will go wrong' is broken, you should detect a HV pulsing at the output pins
of T2 and T3.

Adjust R6 for a discharge from 5 to 30 shots/sec. This should correspond to
a battery current of 1 to 2 Amps when measured by connecting a current meter
across the switch.Caution, coz this action shorts out S1. The pulse rep. rate
should not be set where the battery current exceeds 2 Amps.
