CAPSTUN: Capstun (capsaicin) is the active oil in red pepper. If you don't 
think something derived from pepper can be as good as CN or CS tear gas,
think. Even if a person is maced, he can still can still function if he is 
motivated enough. Capstun is an irritant which causes nasal passages to swell
, making the affected person breathe through their mouth which in turn causes
them to inhale the capstun which affects the throat causing choking. It's 
effect in the eyes is extreme tearing and pain. In addition it causes a
burning sensation on any exposed skin. Capstun does not cause permanent
damage.
Capstun is easy to make. The only drawback is you have to heat up ethyl
alcohol which is flammable.
Obtain 1 lb. of dried red or green hot peppers. The hotter the better. Chop
them up in a blender and put them into a large jug. Add denatured ethyl 
alcohol to the peppers until they are covered by an inch or two of alcohol.
Put the jug into a pot of water on an electric burner and bring the alcohol
almost to a simmer. Be very careful as the alcohol fumes can ignite. Don't
use a flame to heat the water. Let the alcohol cool a bit then filter it off.
Repeat this 3 times. Throw out the peppers and put all the alcohol into a
large mouthed jar. Take the water pot/heater outside and heat up the alcohol.
Evaporate the alcohol down to about 100 mls. Filter off the alcohol again
and let it evaporate to leave a thick reddish oil. If you are adventurish
take a minute amount of the oil and taste it. Have plenty of water on hand
though.
Capstun is usually used as a 1% to 5% solution. Cut it down with mineral oil
or another suitable carrier.
CAPSTUN BOMB: Take a 12 gauge shotgun shell and open the crimp. Pour out the
shot and seal the shot cup with a thin layer of epoxy. The seal must be oil-
proof. Take a 1 in. long piece of broomhandle and drill a small hole through
it's center. Epoxy it onto the brass end of the shell so that the hole is 
over the primer. Now fill the shell with a 5% solution of capstun. Close the
crimp up again and epoxy the end shut. Take a cloth streamer about 1 1/2 in.
wide by 2 ft. long and epoxy one end of it to the crimp end of the shell.
When all is ready take a short nail and insert it through the hole up against
the primer. Hold it in place with 2 pieces of tape. To use this, fold the
streamer up in your palm and place the shell on top of the streamer. Throw
the shell in a high arc. The streamer will cause the shell to land nail end 
first setting off the primer. When the shell goes off it will spray the 
capstun into the air. Two of these can clear the street.
If you have problems with the capstun leaking, try loading it first into a
small plastic bag. Heat seal the open end of the bag then load it in the
shotgun shell without the shot cup.
Even though the capstun won't cause damage, the carrier it is dissolved in
can, so chose it carefully.
