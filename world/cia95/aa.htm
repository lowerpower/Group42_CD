<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy, although offshore banking
 and oil refining and storage are also important. The rapid growth of the
 tourism sector over the last decade has resulted in a substantial expansion
 of other activities. Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five  times
the 1985 level. Additionally, the reopening of the country's oil  refinery
in 1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange  earnings, has
further spurred growth. Aruba's small labor force and less  than 1% unemployment
rate have led to a large number of unfilled job  vacancies despite sharp rises
in wage rates in recent years.
