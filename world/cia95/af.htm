- Burhanuddin RABBANI was elected to a two-year term by a national  shura,
later amended by multi-party agreement to 18 months; note - in June  1994
failure to agree on a transfer mechanism resulted in RABBANI's  extending

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly dependent
on  farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and goats).  Economic
considerations have played second fiddle to political and military  upheavals
during more than 15 years of war, including the nearly 10-year  Soviet military
occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). Over the past  decade, one-third
of the population fled the country, with Pakistan  sheltering more than 3
million refugees and Iran about 3 million. About 1.4  million Afghan refugees
remain in Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran.  Another 1 million probably
moved into and around urban areas within  Afghanistan. Although reliable data
are unavailable, gross domestic product  is lower than 13 years ago because
of the loss of labor and capital and the  disruption of trade and transport.
