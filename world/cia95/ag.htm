<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting
for  roughly 57% of government revenues, 25% of GDP, and almost all export
 earnings; Algeria has the fifth largest reserves of natural gas in the  world
and ranks fourteenth for oil. Algiers' efforts to reform one of the  most
centrally planned economies in the Arab world began after the 1986  collapse
of world oil prices plunged the country into a severe recession.  In 1989,
the government launched a comprehensive, IMF-supported program to  achieve
macroeconomic stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into  the economy.
Despite substantial progress toward macroeconomic adjustment,  in 1992 the
reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political  turmoil. In
September 1993, a new government was formed, and one priority  was the resumption
and acceleration of the structural adjustment process.  Buffeted by the slump
in world oil prices and burdened with a heavy foreign  debt, Algiers concluded
a one-year standby arrangement with the IMF in  April 1994.
