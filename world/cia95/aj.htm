<p> <a href="index.htm">Azerbaijan </a></h1>
<p><i>Note--Azerbaijan continues to be
plagued by an unresolved seven-year-old conflict  with Armenian separatists
over its Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh  Armenians have declared independence
and seized almost 20% of the country's  territory, creating almost 1 million
Azeri displaced persons in the  process. Both sides have generally observed
a Russian-mediated cease-fire  in place since May 1994, and support the OSCE-mediated
peace process, now  entering its fourth year. Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi
(Stepanakert)  remain far apart on most substantive issues from the placement
and  composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclave's ultimate political
 status, and prospects for a negotiated settlement remain dim. </i>

<p>
<b>Location:</b> Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran and Russia 


<p>
<b>Map references:</b> Commonwealth of Independent States - European States  

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total area:</i> 86,600 sq km  
<br><i>land area:</i> 86,100 sq km  
<br><i>comparative area:</i> slightly larger than Maine 
<br><i>note:</i> includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the  Nagorno-Karabakh
region; the region's autonomy was abolished by Azerbaijani  Supreme Soviet
on 26 November 1991 

<p>
<b>Land boundaries:</b> total 2,013 km, Armenia (west) 566 km, Armenia (southwest) 221 km,

km, Turkey  9 km

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> large, flat Kur-Araz Lowland (much of it below sea level) with Great
 Caucasus Mountains to the north, Qarabag (Karabakh) Upland in west; Baku

 area in the world because of severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil
 pollution results from the use of DDT as a pesticide and also from toxic
 defoliants used in the production of cotton

Sea

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia,
 the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
 its majority nominally Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and
 low standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are oil,  cotton,
and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in  decline
for several years, but the November 1994 ratification of the $7.5  billion
oil deal with a consortium of Western companies should generate the  funds
needed to spur future industrial development. Azerbaijan accounted  for 1.5%
to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union.  Azerbaijan
shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet republics in  making the
transition from a command to a market economy, but its  considerable energy
resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku has  only recently begun
making progress on economic reform, and old economic  ties and structures
have yet to be replaced.
