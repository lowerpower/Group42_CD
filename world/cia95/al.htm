<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> An extremely poor country by European standards, Albania is making
the  difficult transition to a more open-market economy. The economy rebounded
 in 1993-94 after a severe depression accompanying the collapse of the  previous
centrally planned system in 1990 and 1991. Stabilization policies  - including
a strict monetary policy, public sector layoffs, and reduced  social services
- have improved the government's fiscal situation and  reduced inflation.
The recovery was spurred by the remittances of some 20%  of the population
which works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These  remittances supplement
GDP and help offset the large foreign trade deficit.  Foreign assistance and
humanitarian aid also supported the recovery. Most  agricultural land was
privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant  incomes. Albania's limited
industrial sector, now less than one-sixth of  GDP, continued to decline in
1994. A sharp fall in chromium prices reduced  hard currency receipts from
the mining sector. Large segments of the  population, especially those living
in urban areas, continue to depend on  humanitarian aid to meet basic food
requirements. Unemployment remains a  severe problem accounting for approximately
one-fifth of the work force.  Growth is expected to continue in 1995, but
could falter if Albania becomes  involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,
workers' remittances  from Greece are reduced, or foreign assistance declines.
