<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed
a more  modern industrial sector, supplying machine building equipment, textiles,
 and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw  materials
and energy resources. Armenia is a large food importer and its  mineral deposits
(gold, bauxite) are small. The economic decline in recent  years (1991-94)
has been particularly severe due to the ongoing conflict  over the ethnic
Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh in  Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and
Turkey have blockaded pipeline and railroad  traffic to Armenia for its support
of the Karabakh Armenians. This has left  Armenia with chronic energy shortages
because of a lack of capacity and  frequent disruptions of natural gas deliveries
through unstable Georgia, as  well as difficulties in obtaining other types
of fuel. In addition, bread  is strictly rationed and there are shortages
of other goods. In 1994, the  economy seemed to bottom out. The government
has managed to increase its  financial and budgetary discipline, bringing
inflation down from around 40%  per month in first half 1994 to single digits
in second half 1994 and the  first quarter of 1995. A full economic recovery
cannot be expected until  the conflict is settled and the blockade lifted.
