<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounts for roughly 80%
of  GDP. An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually, attracted by  Andorra's
duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. The  banking sector,
with its "tax haven" status, also contributes substantially  to the economy.
Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity of arable  land, and most
food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is  sheep raising.
Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and  furniture. Andorra
is a member of the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what  effect the European
Single Market will have on the advantages Andorra  obtains from its duty-free
status.
