<h3>Government</h3>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Civil war has been the norm since independence from Portugal on 11

the  insurgent National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
 refused to accept its defeat in internationally monitored elections and 
fighting resumed throughout much of the countryside. The two sides signed
 another peace accord on 20 November 1994; the cease-fire is generally  holding
but most provisions of the accord remain to be implemented.

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80%-90% of
the  population but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is vital
 to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Despite the signing of a 
peace accord in November 1994 between the Angola government and the UNITA
 insurgents, sporadic fighting continues and many farmers remain reluctant
 to return to their fields. As a result, much of the country's food  requirements
must still be imported. Angola has rich natural resources -  notably gold,
diamonds, and arable land, in addition to large oil deposits  - but will need
to observe the cease-fire, implement the peace agreement,  and reform government
policies if it is to achieve its potential.
