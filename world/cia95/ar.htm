<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Argentina, rich in natural resources, benefits also from a highly literate
 population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified  industrial
base. Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and  statist policies,
the economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge  external debts and recurring
bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in  the depths of recession, President
MENEM has implemented a comprehensive  economic restructuring program that
shows signs of putting Argentina on a  path of stable, sustainable growth.
Argentina's currency has traded at par  with the US dollar since April 1991,
and inflation has fallen to its lowest  level in 20 years. Argentines have
responded to the relative price  stability by repatriating flight capital
and investing in domestic  industry. The economy registered an impressive
6% advance in 1994, fueled  largely by inflows of foreign capital and strong
domestic consumption  spending. The government's major short term objective
is encouraging  exports, e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. At
the start of  1995, the government had to deal with the spillover from international
 financial movements associated with the devaluation of the Mexican peso.
In  addition, unemployment had become a serious issue for the government.
 Despite average annual 7% growth in 1991-94, unemployment surprisingly has
 doubled - due mostly to layoffs in government bureaus and in privatized 
industrial firms and utilities and, to a lesser degree, to illegal  immigration.
Much remains to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old  statist barriers
to growth, extending the recent economic gains, and  bringing down the rate
of unemployment.
