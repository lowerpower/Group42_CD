<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a
per  capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European countries.
 Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
 products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Primary products account for
 more than 60% of the value of total exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a  downturn
in world commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy.  The government
is pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but  competition in
international markets continues to be severe. Australia has  suffered from
the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD  countries in
the early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly from  the prolonged
recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor being weak  world demand
for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so strongly in 1994  that the government
felt the need for fiscal and monetary tightening by  yearend. Australia's
GDP grew 6.4% in 1994, largely due to increases in  industrial output and
business investment. A severe drought in 1994 is  expected to reduce the value
of Australia's net farm production by $825  million in the twelve months through
June 1995, but rising world commodity  prices are likely to boost rural exports
by 7.7% to $14.5 billion in  1995/96, according to government statistics.
