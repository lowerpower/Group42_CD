<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Austria boasts a prosperous and stable market economy with a sizable
but  falling proportion of nationalized industry and with extensive welfare
 benefits. Thanks to its raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor
 force, and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies  specialized
niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and  produces
almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force  in agriculture.
After 11 consecutive years of growth, the Austrian economy  experienced a
mild recession in 1993, but growth resumed in 1994.  Unemployment is 4.3%
and will likely stay at that level as companies adjust  to the competition
of EU membership beginning 1 January 1995. To prepare  for EU membership,
Austria's government has taken measures to open the  economy by introducing
a major tax reform, privatizing state-owned firms,  and liberalizing cross-border
capital movements. Problems for the 1990s  include an aging population, the
high level of industrial subsidies, and  the struggle to keep welfare benefits
within budgetary capabilities - the  deficit climbed to over 4% of GDP in
1994.
