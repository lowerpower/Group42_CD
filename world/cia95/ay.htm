<h3>Geography</h3>

<p>
<b>Location:</b> continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle 

<p>
<b>Map references:</b> Antarctic Region  

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total area:</i> 14 million sq km (est.) 
<br><i>land area:</i> 14 million sq km (est.) 
<br><i>comparative area:</i> slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US 
<br><i>note:</i> second-smallest continent (after Australia) 

<p>
<b>Land boundaries:</b> none, but see entry on International disputes 

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 17,968 km  

<p>
<b>Maritime claims:</b> none, but see entry on International Disputes 

<p>
<b>International disputes:</b> Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic Treaty Summary below);
 sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France
 (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and
 UK; the US and most other nations do not recognize the territorial claims
 of other nations and have made no claims themselves (the US reserves the
 right to do so); no formal claims have been made in the sector between 90
 degrees west and 150 degrees west 

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance
from  the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of
its  higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate;
higher  temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly
below  freezing 

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average
 elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897  meters
high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria  Land, Wilkes
Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island  on McMurdo Sound;
glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the  coastline, and floating
ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the  continent 

<p>
<b>Natural resources:</b> none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel,
 platinum and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in
 small, uncommercial quantities  

<p>
<b>Land use:</b> 
<br><i>arable land:</i> 0%  
<br><i>permanent crops:</i> 0%  
<br><i>meadows and pastures:</i> 0%  
<br><i>forest and woodland:</i> 0%  
<br><i>other:</i> 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%) 

<p>
<b>Irrigated land:</b> 0 sq km  

<p>
<b>Environment:</b> 
<br><i>current issues:</i> in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield, which protects
the  Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had dwindled to the
 lowest level recorded over Antarctica since 1975 when measurements were 
first taken 
<br><i>natural hazards:</i> katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from the high interior;
 frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau; cyclonic storms form
 over the ocean and move clockwise along the coast; volcanism on Deception
 Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare
 and weak 
<br><i>international agreements:</i> NA  

<p>
<b>Note:</b> the coldest, windiest, highest, and driest continent; during summer
more  solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received
at  the Equator in an equivalent period; mostly uninhabitable

 economic difficulties

<b>Type:</b> 
<br><i>Antarctic Treaty Summary:</i> The Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force
on  23 June 1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of  Antarctica.
Administration is carried out through consultative member  meetings - the
18th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan in  April 1993. Currently,
there are 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative  and 16 acceding. Consultative
(voting) members include the seven nations  that claim portions of Antarctica
as national territory (some claims  overlap) and 19 nonclaimant nations. The
US and some other nations that  have made no claims have reserved the right
to do so. The US does not  recognize the claims of others. The year in parentheses
indicates when an  acceding nation was voted to full consultative (voting)
status, while no  date indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory.
Claimant  nations are - Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand,
Norway, and  the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil
(1983),  China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India
(1983),  Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru
(1989),  Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay
(1985),  the US, and Russia.  Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession
in parentheses, are -  Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia
(1988), Cuba  (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987),
Guatemala  (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981),
 Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993), Switzerland (1990), and Ukraine (1992). 

<br><i>Article 1:</i> area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such
as  weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and equipment may
be  used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose 
<br><i>Article 2:</i> freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall continue 

<br><i>Article 3:</i> free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with the
UN and  other international agencies 
<br><i>Article 4:</i> does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial claims and no
new  claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force 
<br><i>Article 5:</i> prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes 
<br><i>Article 6:</i> includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees
00  minutes south 
<br><i>Article 7:</i> treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial observation,
to  any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; 
advance notice of all activities and of the introduction of military  personnel
must be given 
<br><i>Article 8:</i> allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own
states 
<br><i>Article 9:</i> frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations 
<br><i>Article 10:</i> treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica
that  are contrary to the treaty 
<br><i>Article 11:</i> disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately,
 by the ICJ 
<br><i>Articles 12, 13, 14:</i> deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved
 nations 
<br><i>Other agreements:</i> more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings
and  ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures for the Conservation
of  Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
 Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988
 but was subsequently rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental  Protection
to the Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits ratification; this  agreement
provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through  five specific
annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental  impact assessments,
waste management, and protected areas; it also  prohibits all activities relating
to mineral resources except scientific  research; 14 parties have ratified
Protocol as of April 1995 

<p>
<b>Legal system:</b> US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals,
 such as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other  countries.
Some US laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the  Antarctic Conservation
Act, 16 U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil  and criminal penalties
for the following activities, unless authorized by  regulation of statute:
The taking of native mammals or birds; the  introduction of nonindigenous
plants and animals; entry into specially  protected or scientific areas; the
discharge or disposal of pollutants; and  the importation into the US of certain
items from Antarctica. Violation of  the Antarctic Conservation Act carries
penalties of up to $10,000 in fines  and 1 year in prison. The Departments
of Treasury, Commerce,  Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.
Public Law  95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires expeditions
 from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and
 Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which
 reports such plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.

Science Foundation, Arlington, Virginia 22230 (703-306-1031).
