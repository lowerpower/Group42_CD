<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Tiny in area, Bahrain is well-to-do in economic resources and per capita
 income. Petroleum production and processing account for about 80% of export
 receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 30% of GDP. Economic conditions
 have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of oil since 1985, for example,
 during and following the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. With its highly developed
 communication and transport facilities Bahrain is home to numerous  multinational
firms with business in the Gulf. A large share of exports  consists of petroleum
products made from imported crude. Prospects for 1995  are good, with private
enterprise the main driving force, e.g., in banking  and construction. Unemployment,
especially among the young, and the  depletion of both oil and underground
water resources are major long-term  economic problems.
