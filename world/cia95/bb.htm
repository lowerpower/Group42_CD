<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> A per capita income of $9,200 gives Barbados one of the highest standards
 of living of all the small island states of the eastern Caribbean.  Historically,
the economy was based on the cultivation of sugarcane and  related activities.
In recent years, however, the economy has diversified  into manufacturing
and tourism. A moderate recovery that began in late 1993  after 3 years of
contraction is mainly due to increased tourism and  expansion in the construction
sector. Economic prospects for 1995 depend  mostly on continued growth in
the industrialized countries, especially in  Europe, which would spur further
expansion in tourism.
