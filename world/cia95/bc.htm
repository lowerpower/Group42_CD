<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops.
 Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population
 but supplies only about 50% of food needs and accounts for only 5% of GDP.
 Subsistence farming and cattle raising predominate. The driving force  behind
the rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining  industry.
This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from  generating
25% of GDP in 1980 to 39% in 1994. No other sector has  experienced such growth,
especially not agriculture, which is plagued by  erratic rainfall and poor
soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at  25%. Hampered by a still
sluggish diamond market in 1994, GDP grew by only  1%.
