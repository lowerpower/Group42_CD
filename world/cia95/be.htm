<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central
 geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified
 industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the  populous
Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging  reinvestment
in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources  Belgium must
import substantial quantities of raw materials and export a  large volume
of manufactures, making its economy unusually dependent on the  state of world
markets. Three-fourths of its trade is with other EU  countries. The economy
grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90,  slowed to 1% in 1991-92,
dropped by 1.5% in 1993, and recovered with 2.3%  growth in 1994. Belgium's
public debt has risen to 140% of GDP, and the  government is trying to control
its expenditures to bring the figure more  into line with other industrialized
countries.
