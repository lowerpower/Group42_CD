<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to improve economic
 and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest,
 most densely populated, and least developed nations. Its economy is  overwhelmingly
agricultural, with the cultivation of rice the single most  important activity
in the economy. Major impediments to growth include  frequent cyclones and
floods, the inefficiency of state-owned enterprises,  a rapidly growing labor
force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture,  delays in exploiting energy
resources (natural gas), and inadequate power  supplies. Excellent rice crops
and expansion of the export garment industry  led to real growth of 4% in
1992 and again in 1993. Policy measures  intended to reduce government regulation
of private industry, to curb  population growth, and to expand employment
opportunities have had only  partial success given the serious nature of Bangladesh's
basic problems.
