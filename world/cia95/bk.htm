<p><i>Note--Bosnia and Herzegovina is
set to enter its third year of interethnic civil  strife which began in the
spring of 1992 after the Government of Bosnia and  Herzegovina held a referendum
on independence. Bosnia's Serbs - supported  by neighboring Serbia - responded
with armed resistance aimed at  partitioning the republic along ethnic lines
and joining Serb-held areas to  'greater Serbia'. In March 1994, Bosnia's
Muslims and Croats reduced the  number of warring factions from three to two
by signing an agreement in  Washington, DC, creating the Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. A group  of rebel Muslims, however, continues to battle government
forces in the  northwest enclave of Bihac. A Contact Group of countries, the
US, UK,  France, Germany, and Russia, continues to seek a resolution between
the  Federation and the Bosnian Serbs. In July of 1994 the Contact Group 
presented a plan to the warring parties that roughly equally divides the 
country between the two, while maintaining Bosnia in its current  internationally
recognized borders. The Federation agreed to the plan  almost immediately,
while the Bosnian Serbs rejected it. </i>

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav Republic
of  Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav federation. Although
 agriculture has been almost all in private hands, farms have been small and
 inefficient, and the republic traditionally has been a net importer of  food.
Industry has been greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the  rigidities of
Communist central planning and management. TITO had pushed  the development
of military industries in the republic with the result that  Bosnia hosted
a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of February  1995, Bosnia
and Herzegovina was being torn apart by the continued bitter  interethnic
warfare that has caused production to plummet, unemployment and  inflation
to soar, and human misery to multiply. No economic statistics for  1992-94
are available, although output clearly has fallen substantially  below the
levels of earlier years and almost certainly is well below $1,000  per head.
The country receives substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from  the international
community.
