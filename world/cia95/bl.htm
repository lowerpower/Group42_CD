<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> With its long history of semifeudal social controls, dependence on
volatile  prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of hyperinflation, Bolivia
has  remained one of the poorest and least developed Latin American countries.
 However, Bolivia has experienced generally improving economic conditions
 since the PAZ Estenssoro administration (1985-89) introduced  market-oriented
policies which reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to  about 20% in 1988.
PAZ Estenssoro was followed as President by Jaime PAZ  Zamora (1989-93) who
continued the free-market policies of his predecessor,  despite opposition
from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful  labor movement. By maintaining
fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce  inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while
GDP grew by an annual average of 3.25%  during his tenure. Inaugurated in
August 1993, President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA  has vowed to advance the market-oriented
economic reforms he helped launch  as PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister.
His successes so far have included  an inflation rate that continues to decrease
- the 1994 rate of 8.5% was  the lowest in ten years - the signing of a free
trade agreement with  Mexico, and progress on his unique privatization plan.
The main  privatization bill was passed by the Bolivian legislature in late
March  1994. Related laws - one that establishes SIRESE, the regulatory agency
 that will oversee the privatizations, and another that outlines the rules
 for privatization in the electricity sector - were approved later in the
 year.
