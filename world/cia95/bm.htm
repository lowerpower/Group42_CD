<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Burma has a mixed economy with about 75% private activity, mainly in
 agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with about 25%  state-controlled
activity, mainly in energy, heavy industry, and foreign  trade. Government
policy in the last six years, 1989-94, has aimed at  revitalizing the economy
after four decades of tight central planning.  Thus, private activity has
markedly increased; foreign investment has been  encouraged, so far with moderate
success; and efforts continue to increase  the efficiency of state enterprises.
Published estimates of Burma's foreign  trade are greatly understated because
of the volume of black market trade.  A major ongoing problem is the failure
to achieve monetary and fiscal  stability. Although Burma remains a poor Asian
country, its rich resources  furnish the potential for substantial long-term
increases in income,  exports, and living standards.
