<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence
 agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth in real output
 has averaged a sound 4% in 1991-94 but this rate barely exceeds the rapid
 population growth of 3.3%. Inflation jumped to 35% in 1994 (compared to 3%
 in 1993) following the 50% currency devaluation in January. Commercial and
 transport activities, which make up almost 36% of GDP, are extremely  vulnerable
to developments in Nigeria as evidenced by decreased reexport  trade in 1994
due to a severe contraction in Nigerian demand. The  industrial sector accounts
for less than 10% of GDP and mainly produces  foods, beverages, cement, and
textiles. Support by the Paris Club and  official bilateral creditors has
eased the external debt situation in  recent years. The government, still
burdened with money-losing state  enterprises and a bloated civil service,
is gradually implementing a World  Bank supported structural adjustment program.
