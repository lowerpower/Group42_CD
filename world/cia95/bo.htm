<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Belarus ranks among the most developed of the former Soviet states,
with a  relatively modern - by Soviet standards - and diverse machine building
 sector and a robust agriculture sector. It also serves as a transport link
 for Russian oil exports to the Baltic states and Eastern and Western  Europe.
The breakup of the Soviet Union and its command economy has  resulted in a
sharp economic contraction as traditional trade ties have  collapsed. The
Belarusian government has lagged behind the governments of  most other former
Soviet states in economic reform, with privatization  almost nonexistent.
The system of state orders and distribution persists.  In mid-1994, the Belarusian
government embarked on an austerity program  with IMF support to slash state
credits and consumer subsidies in order to  bring down the budget deficit
and reduce inflation. However, despite its  promising start, the regime's
drive to reinvigorate the economy has fallen  short, and the IMF has criticized
its failure to implement the reforms that  the Fund had negotiated. As a result,
the IMF has suspended talks on  introducing a stand-by arrangement. Economic
relations with Russia, which  will have an important bearing on the future
course of the economy, will be  strengthened if Minsk adopts the necessary
legislation to implement a  customs union agreed to in January 1995.
