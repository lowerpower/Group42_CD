<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors,
 entered the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an  unserviceable
foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy direction.  In addition,
the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking, and  protected by substantial
trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major  industrial and mining facilities
is divided among private interests -  including several multinationals - and
the government. Most large  agricultural holdings are private, with the government
channeling financing  to this sector. Conflicts between large landholders
and landless peasants  have produced intermittent violence. The COLLOR government,
which assumed  office in March 1990, launched an ambitious reform program
that sought to  modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices,
deregulating  the economy, and opening it to increased foreign competition.
Itamar  FRANCO, who assumed the presidency following President COLLOR's resignation
 in December 1992, was out of step with COLLOR's reform agenda; initiatives
 to redress fiscal problems, privatize state enterprises, and liberalize 
trade and investment policies lost momentum. Galloping inflation - by June
 1994 the monthly rate had risen to nearly 50% - had undermined economic 
stability. In response, the then finance minister, Fernando Henrique  CARDOSO,
launched the third phase of his stabilization plan, known as Plano  Real,
that called for a new currency, the real, which was introduced on 1  July
1994. Inflation subsequently dropped to under 3% per month through the  end
of 1994. The newly elected President CARDOSO has called for the  implementation
of sweeping market-oriented reform, including public sector  and fiscal reform,
privatization, deregulation, and elimination of barriers  to increased foreign
investment. Brazil's natural resources remain a major,  long-term economic
strength.
