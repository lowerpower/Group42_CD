<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on agriculture
 and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of the population
 and account for about half of GDP. Agriculture consists largely of  subsistence
farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the  terrain and make
the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult  and expensive. The
economy is closely aligned with India's through strong  trade and monetary
links. The industrial sector is small and  technologically backward, with
most production of the cottage industry  type. Most development projects,
such as road construction, rely on Indian  migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower
potential and its attraction for  tourists are key resources; however, the
government limits the number of  tourists to 4,000 per year to minimize foreign
influence. Much of the  impetus for growth has come from large public-sector
companies.  Nevertheless, in recent years, Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized
 development planning and greater private initiative. The government  privatized
several large public-sector firms, is revamping its trade regime  and liberalizing
administerial procedures over industrial licensing. The  government's industrial
contribution to GDP decreased from 13% in 1988 to  about 11% in 1993.
