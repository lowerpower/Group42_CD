<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Bulgarian economy continued its painful adjustment in 1994 from
the  misdirected development undertaken during four decades of Communist rule.
 Many aspects of a market economy have been put in place and have begun to
 function, but much of the economy, especially the industrial sector, has
 yet to re-establish market links lost with the collapse of the other  centrally
planned Soviet Bloc economies. The prices of many imported  industrial inputs,
especially energy products, have risen markedly, and  falling real wages have
not sufficed to restore competitiveness. The  government plans more extensive
privatization in 1995 to improve the  management of enterprises and to encourage
foreign investment. Bulgaria  resumed payments on its $10 billion in commercial
debt in 1993 following  the negotiation of a 50% write-off.
