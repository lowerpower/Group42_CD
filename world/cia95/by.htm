<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic 
development, Burundi since October 1993 has suffered from massive  ethnic-based
violence that has displaced an estimated million people,  disrupted production,
and set back needed reform programs. Burundi is  predominately agricultural
with roughly 90% of the population dependent on  subsistence agriculture.
Its economic health depends on the coffee crop,  which accounts for 80% of
foreign exchange earnings. The ability to pay for  imports therefore continues
to rest largely on the vagaries of the climate  and the international coffee
market. As part of its economic reform agenda,  launched in February 1991
with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi is  trying to diversify its agricultural
exports, attract foreign investment in  industry, and modernize government
budgetary practices. Although the  government remains committed to reforms,
it fears new austerity measures  would add to ethnic tensions.
