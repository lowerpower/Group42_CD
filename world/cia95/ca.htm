<p>
<b>Land boundaries:</b> total 8,893 km, US 8,893 km (includes 2,477 km with Alaska) 

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 243,791 km

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely
 resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic system, and
 pattern of production. Since World War II the impressive growth of the  manufacturing,
mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from  a largely rural
economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the  1980s, Canada registered
one of the highest rates of real growth among the  OECD nations, averaging
about 3.2%. With its great natural resources,  skilled labor force, and modern
capital plant, Canada has excellent  economic prospects, although the country
still faces high unemployment and  a growing debt. Moreover, the continuing
constitutional impasse between  English- and French-speaking areas has observers
discussing a possible  split in the confederation; foreign investors have
become edgy.
