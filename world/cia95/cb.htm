<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Cambodian economy - virtually destroyed by decades of war - is
slowly  recovering. Government leaders are moving toward restoring fiscal
and  monetary discipline and have established good working relations with
 international financial institutions. Growth, starting from a low base, has
 been strong in 1991-94. Despite such positive developments, the  reconstruction
effort faces many tough challenges because of the  persistence of internal
political divisions and the related lack of  confidence of foreign investors.
Rural Cambodia, where 90% of about 9.5  million Khmer live, remains mired
in poverty. The almost total lack of  basic infrastructure in the countryside
will hinder development and will  contribute to a growing imbalance in growth
between urban and rural areas  over the near term. Moreover, the government's
lack of experience in  administering economic and technical assistance programs
and rampant  corruption among officials will slow the growth of critical public
sector  investment. Inflation for 1994 as a whole was less than a quarter
of the  1992 rate and was declining during the year.
