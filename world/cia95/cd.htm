<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment, and lack of
 infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in the
 world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil, conflict with Libya,
 drought, and food shortages. Consequently the economy has shown little  progress
in recent years in overcoming a severe setback brought on by civil  war in
the late 1980s. More than 80% of the work force is involved in  subsistence
farming and fishing. Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting  for at least
half of exports. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid,  especially food
credits, given chronic shortages in several regions. Of all  the Francophone
countries in Africa, Chad has benefited the least from the  50% devaluation
of their currencies on 12 January 1994. Despite an increase  in external financial
aid and favorable price increases for cotton - the  primary source of foreign
exchange - the corrupt and enfeebled government  bureaucracy continues to
dampen economic enterprise by neglecting payments  to domestic suppliers and
public sector salaries. Oil production in the  Lake Chad area remains a distant
prospect and the subsistence-driven  economy probably will continue to limp
along in the near term.
