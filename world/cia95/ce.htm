<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Industry - dominated by the fast-growing apparel industry - has surpassed
 agriculture as the main source of export earnings and accounts for over 16%
 of GDP. The economy has been plagued by high rates of unemployment since
 the late 1970s. Economic growth, which has been depressed by ethnic unrest,
 accelerated in 1991-94 as domestic conditions began to improve and  conditions
for foreign investment brightened. Currently, however, the new  government's
emphasis on populist measures has clouded Sri Lanka's economic  prospects.
