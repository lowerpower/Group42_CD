<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts,
an  industrial sector based largely on oil, support services, and a government
 characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform program,  supported
by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in 1990-91  because of problems
in changing to a democratic political regime and a  heavy debt-servicing burden.
Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of  the economy, providing about
two-thirds of government revenues and exports.  In the early 1980s rapidly
rising oil revenues enabled Congo to finance  large-scale development projects
with growth averaging 5% annually, one of  the highest rates in Africa. Subsequently,
growth has slowed to an average  of roughly 1.5% annually, only two-thirds
of the population growth rate.  Political turmoil and misguided government
investment have derailed  economic reform programs sponsored by the IMF and
World Bank. Even with  these difficulties Congo enjoys one of the highest
incomes per capita in  sub-Saharan Africa
