<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Zaire's economy has continued to disintegrate although Prime Minister
KENGO  has had some success in slowing the rate of economic decline. While
 meaningful economic figures are difficult to come by, Zaire's  hyperinflation,
chronic large government deficits, and plunging mineral  production have made
the country one of the world's poorest. Most formal  transactions are conducted
in hard currency as indigenous bank notes have  lost almost all value, and
a barter economy now flourishes in all but the  largest cities. Most individuals
and families hang on grimly through  subsistence farming and petty trade.
The government has not been able to  meet its financial obligations to the
International Monetary Fund or put in  place the financial measures advocated
by the IMF. Although short-term  prospects for improvement are dim, improved
political stability would boost  Zaire's long-term potential to effectively
exploit its vast wealth of  mineral and agricultural resources.
