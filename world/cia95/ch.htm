<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move
the  economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a
more  productive and flexible economy with market elements, but still within
the  framework of monolithic Communist control. To this end the authorities
 switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place
of  the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and
 plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale  enterprise
in services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to  increased
foreign trade and investment. The result has been a strong surge  in production,
particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Industry  also has posted
major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and  opposite Taiwan,
where foreign investment and modern production methods  have helped spur production
of both domestic and export goods. Aggregate  output has more than doubled
since 1978. On the darker side, the leadership  has often experienced in its
hybrid system the worst results of socialism  (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption)
and of capitalism (windfall gains and  stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus
has periodically backtracked,  retightening central controls at intervals.
In 1992-94 annual growth of GDP  accelerated, particularly in the coastal
areas - to more than 10% annually  according to official claims. In late 1993
China's leadership approved  additional long-term reforms aimed at giving
more play to market-oriented  institutions and at strengthening the center's
control over the financial  system. In 1994 strong growth continued in the
widening market-oriented  areas of the economy. At the same time, the government
struggled to (a)  collect revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals;
(b) keep  inflation within bounds; (c) reduce extortion and other economic
crimes;  and (d) keep afloat the large state-owned enterprises, most of which
had  not participated in the vigorous expansion of the economy. From 60 to
100  million surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the
 cities, many barely subsisting through part-time low-pay jobs. Popular  resistance,
changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural  cadres have weakened
China's population control program, which is essential  to the nation's long-term
economic viability. One of the most dangerous  long-term threats to continued
rapid economic growth is the deterioration  in the environment, notably air
pollution, soil erosion, and the steady  fall of the water table especially
in the north.
