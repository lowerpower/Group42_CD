<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market economy, with the degree
of  government intervention varying according to the philosophy of the  different
regimes. Under the center-left government of President AYLWIN,  which took
power in March 1990, spending on social welfare rose steadily.  At the same
time business investment, exports, and consumer spending also  grew substantially.
The new president, FREI, who took office in March 1994,  has emphasized social
spending even more. Growth in 1991-94 has averaged  6.5% annually, with an
estimated one million Chileans having moved out of  poverty in the last four
years. Copper remains vital to the health of the  economy; Chile is the world's
largest producer and exporter of copper.  Success in meeting the government's
goal of sustained annual growth of 5%  depends on world copper prices, the
level of confidence of foreign  investors and creditors, and the government's
own ability to maintain a  conservative fiscal stance.
