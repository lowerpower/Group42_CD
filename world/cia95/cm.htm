<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable agricultural  conditions,
Cameroon has one of the best-endowed, most diversified primary  commodity
economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the  serious problems
facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political  instability, a top-heavy
civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate  for business enterprise.
The development of the oil sector led rapid  economic growth between 1970
and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in  1986, precipitated by steep declines
in the prices of major exports:  coffee, cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings
were cut by almost one-third,  and inefficiencies in fiscal management were
exposed. In 1990-93, with  support from the IMF and World Bank, the government
began to introduce  reforms designed to spur business investment, increase
efficiency in  agriculture, and recapitalize the nation's banks. Political
instability,  following suspect elections in 1992, brought IMF/WB structural
adjustment  to a halt. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January
1994  improved the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and
is the  main barrier to economic improvement.
