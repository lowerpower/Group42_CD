<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of several
islands  that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing
 population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the 
labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high
 unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical  assistance.
Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the  leading sector
of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of  the labor force,
and provides most of the exports. The country is not  self-sufficient in food
production; rice, the main staple, accounts for 90%  of imports. The government
is struggling to upgrade education and technical  training, to privatize commercial
and industrial enterprises, to improve  health services, to diversify exports,
and to reduce the high population  growth rate. Continued foreign support
is essential if the goal of 4%  annual GDP growth is to be reached in the
late 1990s.
