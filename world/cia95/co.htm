<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Colombia's economy has grown steadily since 1991, when the government
 implemented sweeping economic reform measures. President SAMPER, who took
 office in August 1994, has pledged to maintain those reforms while  expanding
government assistance for poor Colombians, who continue to make  up about
40% of the population. In an effort to bring down inflation,  SAMPER has arranged
a "social pact" with business and labor to curtail  price hikes and trim inflation
to 18%. The rapid development of oil, coal,  and other nontraditional industries,
along with copious inflows of capital  and strengthening of prices for coffee,
have helped keep growth at 5%-6%.  Development of the massive Cusiana oilfield
provides the means to sustain  this level over the next several years. Exporters
say, however, that their  sales have been hampered by the appreciation of
the Colombian peso, and  farmers have sought government help in adjusting
to greater foreign  competition. Moreover, increased foreign investment and
even greater  domestic growth have been hindered by an inadequate energy and
 transportation infrastructure and by violence stemming from drug  trafficking
and persistent rural insurgency.
