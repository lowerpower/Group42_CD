<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the
US.  The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues
 have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to 1992 entitled the islands
to  $228 million for capital development, government operations, and special
 programs. A rapidly growing major source of income is the tourist industry,
 which now employs about 50% of the work force. Japanese tourists  predominate.
The agricultural sector is of minor importance and is made up  of cattle ranches
and small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes,  and melons. Industry
is small scale, mostly handicrafts, light  manufacturing, and garment production.
