<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the backbone
of  the CAR economy, with more than 70% of the population living in outlying
 areas. The agricultural sector generates about half of GDP. Timber has  accounted
for about 26% of export earnings and the diamond industry for  54%. Important
constraints to economic development include the CAR's  landlocked position,
a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work  force, and a legacy
of misdirected macroeconomic policies. A major plus is  the large forest reserves,
which the government is moving to protect from  overexploitation. The 50%
devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone  African nations on 12 January
1994 had mixed effects on CAR's economy.  While diamond, timber, coffee, and
cotton exports increased - leading GDP  to increase by 5.5% - inflation rose
to 40%, fueled by the rising prices of  imports on which the economy depends.
CAR's poor resource base and  primitive infrastructure will keep it dependent
on multilateral donors and  France for the foreseeable future.
