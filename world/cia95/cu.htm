<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Cuba's heavily statist economy remains severely depressed as the result
of  its own inefficiencies and the loss of massive amounts of economic aid
from  the former Soviet Bloc. Total output in 1994 was only about half the
output  of 1989. The fall in output and in imports is reflected in the  deterioration
of food supplies, shortages of electricity, inability to get  spare parts,
and the replacement of motor-driven vehicles by bicycles and  draft animals.
Higher world market prices for sugar and nickel in 1994,  however, resulted
in a slight increase in export earnings for the first  time in six years,
despite lower production of both commodities. The growth  of tourism slowed
in late 1994 as a result of negative publicity  surrounding the exodus of
Cubans from the island and other international  factors. The government continued
its aggressive search for foreign  investment and announced preliminary agreements
to form large joint  ventures with Mexican investors in telecommunications
and oil refining. In  mid-1994, the National Assembly began introducing several
new taxes and  price increases to stem growing excess liquidity and restore
some of the  peso's value as a monetary instrument. In October the government
attempted  to stimulate food production by permitting the sale of any surplus
 production (over state quotas) at unrestricted prices at designated  markets.
Similar but much smaller markets were also introduced for the sale  of manufactured
goods in December. The various government measures have  influenced a remarkable
appreciation of the black market value of the peso,  from more than 100 pesos
to the dollar in September 1994 to 40 pesos to the  dollar in early 1995.
Policy discussions continue in the bureaucracy over  the proper pace and scope
of economic reform.
