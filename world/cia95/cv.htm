<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base,
 serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of long-term drought, and a
 high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with commerce, transport,
 and public services accounting for 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the
 population lives in rural areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%;
 the fishing sector accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The
 fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape
 Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from  emigrants
and foreign aid, which form important supplements to GDP.  Economic reforms,
launched by the new democratic government in 1991, are  aimed at developing
the private sector and attracting foreign investment to  diversify the economy.
Prospects for 1995 depend heavily on the maintenance  of aid flows, remittances,
and the momentum of the government's development  program.
