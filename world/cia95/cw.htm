<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are
fruit,  copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a  fruit-processing
plant and several clothing factories. Economic development  is hindered by
the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack  of natural resources
and good transportation links. A large trade deficit  is annually made up
for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid,  largely from New
Zealand. Current economic development plans call for  exploiting the tourism
potential and expanding the fishing industry.
