which  gave the Turkish Cypriots de facto control in the north; Greek Cypriots
 control the only internationally recognized government; on 15 November 1983
 Turkish Cypriot President Rauf DENKTASH declared independence and the  formation
of a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC), which has been  recognized
only by Turkey; both sides publicly call for the resolution of  intercommunal

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. Industry
 contributes 14% to GDP and employs 29% of the labor force, while the  service
sector contributes 53% to GDP and employs 57% of the labor force.  An average
6.8% rise in real GDP between 1986 and 1990 was temporarily  checked in 1991,
because of the adverse effects of the Gulf war on tourism.  After surging
8.5% in 1992, growth slowed to 2.0% in 1993 - its lowest  level in two decades
- because of the decline in tourist arrivals  associated with the recession
in Western Europe, Cyprus' main trading  partner, and the loss in export competitiveness
due to a sharp rise in unit  labor costs. Real GDP is likely to have picked
up in 1994, and inflation is  estimated to have risen to between 5% and 6%.
The Turkish Cypriot economy  has less than one-third the per capita GDP of
the south. Because it is  recognized only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty
arranging foreign  financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there.
The economy  remains heavily dependent on agriculture, which employs one-quarter
of the  work force. Moreover, because the Turkish lira is legal tender, the
Turkish  Cypriot economy has suffered the same high inflation as mainland
Turkey.  The small, vulnerable economy is estimated to have experienced a
sharp drop  in growth during 1994 because of the severe economic crisis affecting
the  mainland. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct
 and indirect aid to nearly every sector; financial support has risen in 
value to about one-third of Turkish Cypriot GDP.
