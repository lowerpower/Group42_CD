<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> This thoroughly modern economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date
 small-scale and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures,
 comfortable living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark
 is self-sufficient in food production. The new center-left coalition  government
will concentrate on reducing the persistent high unemployment  rate and the
budget deficit as well as following the previous government's  policies of
maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. In the  face of recent
international market pressure on the Danish krone, the  coalition has also
vowed to maintain a stable currency. The coalition hopes  to lower marginal
income taxes while maintaining overall tax revenues;  boost industrial competitiveness
through labor market and tax reforms and  increased research and development
funds; and improve welfare services for  the neediest while cutting paperwork
and delays. Prime Minister RASMUSSEN's  reforms will focus on adapting Denmark
to the criteria for European  integration by 1999; although Copenhagen has
won from the European Union  (EU) the right to opt out of the European Monetary
Union (EMU) if a  national referendum rejects it. Denmark is, in fact, one
of the few EU  countries likely to fit into the EMU on time. Denmark is weathering
the  current worldwide slump better than many West European countries. After
 posting 4.5% real GDP growth in 1994, Copenhagen is predicting a continued
 strong showing in 1995, with real GDP up by 3.2%. The government expects
an  upswing in business investment in 1995 to drive economic growth. Although
 unemployment is high, it remains stable compared to most European  countries.
