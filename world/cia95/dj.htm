<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy is based on service activities connected with the country's
 strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa. 
Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital city, the remainder being
 mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall limits crop production to fruits
 and vegetables, and most food must be imported. Djibouti provides services
 as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment
 and refueling center. It has few natural resources and little industry. The
 nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important
 supplement to GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to finance
 development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a
 major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the 
last six years because of recession, civil war, and a high population  growth
rate (including immigrants and refugees).
