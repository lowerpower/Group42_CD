<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas.
Growth  has been uneven in recent years because of fluctuations in prices
for  Ecuador's primary exports - oil and bananas - as well as because of 
government policies designed to curb inflation. President Sixto  DURAN-BALLEN
launched a series of macroeconomic reforms when he came into  office in August
1992 which included raising domestic fuel prices and  utility rates, eliminating
most subsidies, and bringing the government  budget into balance. These measures
helped to reduce inflation from 55% in  1992 to 25% in 1994. DURAN-BALLEN
has a much more favorable attitude toward  foreign investment than his predecessor
and has supported several laws  designed to encourage foreign investment.
Ecuador has implemented free or  complementary trade agreements with Bolivia,
Chile, Colombia, Peru, and  Venezuela, as well as applied for World Trade
Organization membership.  Ecuador signed a standby agreement with the IMF
and rescheduled its $7.6  billion commercial debt in 1994 thereby regaining
access to multilateral  lending. Growth in 1994 speeded up to 3.9%, based
on increased exports of  bananas and non-traditional products, while international
reserves  increased to a record $1.6 billion.
