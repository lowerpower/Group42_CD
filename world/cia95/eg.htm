<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Half of Egypt's GDP originates in the public sector, most industrial
plants  being owned by the government. Overregulation holds back technical
 modernization and foreign investment. Even so, the economy grew rapidly 
during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world 
oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to
 begin negotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. Egypt's
 first IMF standby arrangement concluded in mid-1987 was suspended in early
 1988 because of the government's failure to adopt promised reforms. Egypt
 signed a follow-on program with the IMF and also negotiated a structural
 adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In 1991-93 the government made
 solid progress on administrative reforms such as liberalizing exchange and
 interest rates but resisted implementing major structural reforms like  streamlining
the public sector. As a result, the economy has not gained  momentum and unemployment
has become a growing problem. Egypt probably will  continue making uneven
progress in implementing the successor programs with  the IMF and World Bank
it signed onto in late 1993. Tourism has plunged  since 1992 because of sporadic
attacks by Islamic extremists on tourist  groups. President MUBARAK has cited
population growth as the main cause of  the country's economic troubles. The
addition of about 1.2 million people a  year to the already huge population
of 62 million exerts enormous pressure  on the 5% of the land area available
for agriculture along the Nile.
