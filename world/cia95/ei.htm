<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy is small and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the most
 important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37% of 
GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor force. Although  exports
remain the primary engine for Ireland's robust growth, the economy  is also
benefiting from a rise in consumer spending and recovery in both  construction
and business investment. Ireland has substantially reduced its  external debt
since 1987, to 40% of GDP in 1994. Over the same period,  inflation has fallen
sharply and chronic trade deficits have been  transformed into annual surpluses.
Unemployment remains a serious problem,  however, and job creation is the
main focus of government policy. To ease  unemployment, Dublin aggressively
courts foreign investors and recently  created a new industrial development
agency to aid small indigenous firms.  Government assistance is constrained
by Dublin's continuing deficit  reduction measures.
