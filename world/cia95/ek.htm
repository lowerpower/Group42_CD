<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Agriculture, forestry, and fishing account for about half of GDP and
nearly  all exports. Subsistence farming predominates. Although pre-independence
 Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings,
 the deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has
 diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. A number of aid programs
 sponsored by the World Bank and the international donor community have  failed
to revitalize export agriculture. Businesses for the most part are  owned
by government officials and their family members. Commerce accounts  for about
8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors  for about
38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,  manganese,
uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under  concessions
offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately  successful.
Increased production from recently discovered natural gas  fields will provide
a greater share of exports in 1995.
