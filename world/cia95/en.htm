<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Bolstered by a widespread national desire to reintegrate into Western
 Europe, the Estonian government has pursued an ambitious program of market
 reforms and stabilization measures, which is rapidly transforming the  economy.
Three years after independence - and two years after the  introduction of
the kroon - Estonians are beginning to reap tangible  benefits; inflation,
though still high, was brought down to about 2% per  month in second half
1994; production declines have bottomed out with  estimated growth of 4% in
1994; and living standards are rising. Economic  restructuring has been dramatic.
By 1994 the service sector accounted for  over 55% of GDP, while the once-dominant
heavy industrial sector continues  to shrink. The private sector is growing
rapidly; the share of the state  enterprises in the economy has steadily declined
and by late 1994 accounted  for only about 40% of GDP. Estonia's foreign trade
has shifted rapidly from  East to West; the Western industrialized countries
now account for  two-thirds of foreign trade.
