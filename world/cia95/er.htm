<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea faces the
bitter  economic problems of a small, desperately poor African country. Most
of the  population will continue to depend on subsistence farming. Domestic
output  is substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government
 revenues come from custom duties and income and sales taxes. Eritrea has
 inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for
 revenues from the development of offshore oil, offshore fishing, and  tourism.
For the time being, Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean  ports
for its foreign trade.
