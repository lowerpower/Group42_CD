<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia continues
to  face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest and least developed
 countries in Africa. Its economy is based on agriculture, which accounts
 for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee
 generates 60% of export earnings. The agricultural sector suffers from  frequent
periods of drought, poor cultivation practices, and deterioration  of internal
security conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily  dependent on inputs
from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale  industry, but less
than 10% of agriculture, is state run. The government is  considering selling
off a portion of state-owned plants, and is  implementing reform measures
that are gradually liberalizing the economy. A  major medium-term problem
is the improvement of roads, water supply, and  other parts of an infrastructure
badly neglected during years of civil  strife.
