<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The government of the Czech Republic, using successful stabilization
 policies to bolster its claims to full membership in the western economic
 community, has reduced inflation to 10%, kept unemployment at 3%, balanced
 the budget, run trade surpluses, and reoriented exports to the EU since the
 breakup of the Czechoslovak federation on 1 January 1993. GDP grew 2% in
 1994 after stagnating in 1993 and contracting nearly 20% since 1990.  Prague's
mass privatization program, including its innovative distribution  of ownership
shares to Czech citizens via 'coupon vouchers,' has made the  most rapid progress
in Eastern Europe. When coupon shares are distributed  in early 1995, 75%-80%
of the economy will be in private hands or partially  privatized, according
to the Czech government. Privatized companies still  face major problems in
restructuring; the number of annual bankruptcies  quadrupled in 1994. In September
1994, Prague repaid $471 million in IMF  loans five years ahead of schedule,
making the Czech Republic the first  East European country to pay off all
IMF debts. Despite these outlays,  hard-currency reserves in the banking system
totaled more than $8.5 billion  in October. Standard &amp; Poor's boosted
the Republic's credit rating to BBB+  in mid-1994 - up from a BBB rating that
was already two steps higher than  Hungary's and one step above Greece's rating.
Prague forecasts a balanced  budget, at least 3% GDP growth, 5% unemployment,
and single-digit inflation  for 1995. Inflationary pressures - primarily as
a result of foreign bank  lending to Czech enterprises but perhaps also due
to eased currency  convertibility controls - are likely to be the most troublesome
issues in  1995. Continuing economic recovery in Western Europe should boost
Czech  exports and production but a substantial increase in prices could erode
the  Republic's comparative advantage in low wages and exchange rates. Prague
 already took steps in 1994 to increase control over banking policies to 
neutralize the impact of foreign inflows on the money supply. Although  Czech
unemployment is currently the lowest in Central Europe, it will  probably
increase 1-2 percentage points in 1995 as large state firms go  bankrupt or
are restructured and service sector growth slows.
