<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy was formerly based on agriculture, mainly sheep farming,
which  directly or indirectly employs most of the work force. Dairy farming
 supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter fodder. Exports feature
 shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and
 coins. Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently  exploited
by the islanders. So far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing  industry
have been unsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987  when the government
began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers  operating within the Falklands
exclusive fishing zone. These license fees  total more than $40 million per
year and support the island's health,  education, and welfare system. To encourage
tourism, the Falkland Islands  Development Corporation has built three lodges
for visitors attracted by  the abundant wildlife and trout fishing. The islands
are now self-financing  except for defense. The British Geological Survey
announced a 200-mile oil  exploration zone around the islands in 1993 and
early seismic surveys  suggest substantial reserves capable of producing 500,000
barrels per day.
