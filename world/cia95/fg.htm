<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and
 imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry
 are the most important economic activities, with exports of fish and fish
 products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in
 1992. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited,  support
an expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export.  Cultivation
of crops - rice, cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - is limited  to the coastal
area, where the population is largely concentrated. French  Guiana is heavily
dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is  a serious problem,
particularly among younger workers.
