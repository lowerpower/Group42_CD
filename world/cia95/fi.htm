<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market economy, with
per  capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key economic sector is
 manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and engineering industries.
 Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP.
 Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw
 materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of
 the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining  self-sufficiency
in basic products. Forestry, an important export earner,  provides a secondary
occupation for the rural population. The economy,  which experienced an average
of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989,  sank into deep recession in
1991 as GDP contracted by 6.5%. The recession -  which continued in 1992 with
GDP contracting by 4.1% - has been caused by  economic overheating, depressed
foreign markets, and the dismantling of the  barter system between Finland
and the former Soviet Union under which  Soviet oil and gas had been exchanged
for Finnish manufactured goods. The  Finnish Government has proposed efforts
to increase industrial  competitiveness and efficiency by an increase in exports
to Western  markets, cuts in public expenditures, partial privatization of
state  enterprises, and changes in monetary policy. In June 1991 Helsinki
had tied  the markka to the European Union's (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU)
to  promote stability. Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence
 in the government's policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about
 12% in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in September 1992.
 The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of Finnish exports. The
 recession bottomed out in 1993, and Finland participated in the general 
European upturn of 1994. Unemployment probably will remain a serious  problem
during the next few years; the majority of Finnish firms face a  weak domestic
market and the troubled German and Swedish export markets.  The Finns voted
in an October 1994 referendum to enter the EU, and Finland  officially joined
the Union on 1 January 1995. Increasing integration with  Western Europe will
dominate the economic picture over the next few years.
