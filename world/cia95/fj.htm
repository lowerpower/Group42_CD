<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence
sector.  Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of foreign exchange.
 Industry contributes 13% to GDP, with sugar processing accounting for  one-third
of industrial activity. Roughly 250,000 tourists visit each year.  Political
uncertainty and drought, however, contribute to substantial  fluctuations
in earnings from tourism and sugar and to the emigration of  skilled workers.
In 1992, growth was approximately 3%, based on growth in  tourism and a lessening
of labor-management disputes in the sugar and  gold-mining sectors. In 1993,
the government's budgeted growth rate of 3%  was not achieved because of a
decline in non-sugar agricultural output and  damage from Cyclone Kina. Growth
in 1994 is estimated to be 5%, largely  attributed to increased tourism and
expansion in domestic production,  particularly in the manufacturing sector.
