<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing.
 The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for  high-grade
phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the  remoteness
of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder  development. Financial
assistance from the US is the primary source of  revenue, with the US pledged
to spend $1 billion in the islands in the  1990s. Geographical isolation and
a poorly developed infrastructure are  major impediments to long-term growth.
