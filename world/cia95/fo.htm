<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living standards of
the  Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the
 all-important fishing industry and one of the world's heaviest per capita
 external debts of about $25,000. When the nations of the world extended 
their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese
 no longer could continue their traditional long-distance fishing and  subsequently
depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The government's  tight controls
on fish stocks and its austerity measures have caused a  recession, and subsidy
cuts will force nationalization in the fishing  industry, which has already
been plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has  threatened to withhold its
annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly  one-third of the islands' budget
revenues - unless the Faroese make  significant efforts to balance their budget.
To this extent the Faroe  government is expected to continue its tough policies,
including  introducing a 20% value-added tax (VAT) in 1993, and has agreed
to an IMF  economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to its annual
subsidy,  the Danish government has bailed out the second largest Faroe bank
to the  tune of $140 million since October 1992.
