<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> One of the world's most highly developed economies, France has substantial
 agricultural resources and a diversified modern industrial sector. Large
 tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and subsidies
 have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in Western  Europe.
Largely self-sufficient in agricultural products, France is a major  exporter
of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector generates about  one-quarter
of GDP, and the growing services sector has become crucial to  the economy.
Following stagnation and recession in 1991-93, French GDP in  1994 expanded
2.4%. Growth in 1995 is expected to be in the 3.0% to 3.5%  range. Persistently
high unemployment will still pose a major problem for  the government. Paris
remains committed to maintaining the franc-deutsche  mark parity, which has
kept French interest rates high despite France's low  inflation. Although
the pace of economic and financial integration within  the European Union
has slowed down, integration presumably will remain a  major force shaping
the fortunes of the various economic sectors over the  next few years.
