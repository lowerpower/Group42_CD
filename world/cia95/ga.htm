<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural resources and
has a  limited agricultural base. About 75% of the population is engaged in
crop  production and livestock raising, which contribute 30% to GDP. Small-scale
 manufacturing activity - processing peanuts, fish, and hides - accounts for
 less than 10% of GDP. A sustained structural adjustment program, including
 a liberalized trade policy, had fostered a respectable 4% rate of growth
in  recent years. Reexport trade constitutes one-third of economic activity;
 however, border closures associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late
 1993 led to a halving of reexport trade, reducing government revenues in
 turn. The 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made  Senegalese
goods more competitive and apparently prompted a relaxation of  Senegalese
controls, paving the way for a comeback in reexports. But  overwhelming these
developments were the devastating effects of the  military's takeover in July
1994. By October, traffic at the Port of Banjul  had fallen precipitously
as importers nervously scaled back their  activities with the commencement
of the anticorruption drive by the new  regime. Concerned with the growing
potential for serious unrest after a  countercoup attempt was bloodily put
down by the regime, the United Kingdom  and the EU in November issued a travelers
advisory for The Gambia, which  brought a halt to tourism almost immediately.
The Gambia faces additional  problems in 1995 if, as is likely, economic sanctions
by Western  governments remain in effect in response to indications that the
military  regime intends to stay in power far longer than expected by the
donors.
