<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Notwithstanding its serious ongoing economic problems, Gabon enjoys
a per  capita income more than twice that of most nations of sub-Saharan Africa.
 Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore
in  the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Real growth
 was feeble in 1992 and Gabon continues to face the problem of fluctuating
 prices for its oil, timber, manganese, and uranium exports. Despite an  abundance
of natural wealth, and a manageable rate of population growth,  the economy
is hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal  deficit widened
to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears on its  bilateral debt,
leading to a cancellation of rescheduling agreements with  official and private
creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone currency by  50% in January 1994
did not set off an expected inflationary spiral but the  government must continue
to keep a tight reign on spending and wage  increases.
