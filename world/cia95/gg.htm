<p><i>Note--Georgia has been beset by
ethnic and civil strife since independence. In  late 1991, the country's first
elected president, Zviad GAMSAKHURDIA was  ousted in an armed coup. In October
1993, GAMSAKHURDIA, and his supporters  sponsored a failed attempt to retake
power from the current government led  by former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
SHEVARDNADZE. The Georgian  government has also faced armed separatist conflicts
in the Abkhazia and  South Ossetia regions. A cease-fire went into effect
in South Ossetia in  June 1992 and a joint Georgian-Ossetian-Russian peacekeeping
force has been  in place since that time. Georgian forces were driven out
of the Abkhaz  region in September 1993 after a yearlong war with Abkhaz separatists.
 Nearly 200,000 Georgian refugees have since fled Abkhazia, adding  substantially
to the estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons already  in Georgia.
Russian peacekeepers are deployed along the border of Abkhazia  and the rest
of Georgia. </i>

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around Black Sea tourism;
 cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of manganese and  copper;
and a small industrial sector producing wine, metals, machinery,  chemicals,
and textiles. The country imports the bulk of its energy needs,  including
natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable domestic energy  resource is
hydropower. Since 1990, widespread conflicts, e.g., in  Abkhazia, South Ossetia,
and Mingreliya, have severely aggravated the  economic crisis resulting from
the disintegration of the Soviet command  economy in December 1991. Throughout
1993 and 1994, much of industry was  functioning at only 20% of capacity;
heavy disruptions in agricultural  cultivation were reported; and tourism
was shut down. The country is  precariously dependent on US and EU humanitarian
grain shipments, as most  other foods are priced beyond reach of the average
citizen. Georgia is also  suffering from an acute energy crisis, as it is
having problems paying for  even minimal imports. Georgia is pinning its hopes
for recovery on  reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on developing international
 transportation through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi. The
 government began a tenuous program in 1994 aiming to stabilize prices and
 reduce large consumer subsidies.
