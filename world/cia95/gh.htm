<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana is relatively well off,
having  twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa.
Heavily  reliant on international assistance, Ghana has made steady progress
in  liberalizing its economy since 1983. Overall growth continued at a rate
of  approximately 5% in 1994, due largely to increased gold, timber, and cocoa
 production - major sources of foreign exchange. The economy, however,  continues
to revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 45%  of GDP
and employs 55% of the work force, mainly small landholders. Public  sector
wage increases, regional peacekeeping commitments, and the  containment of
internal unrest in the underdeveloped north have placed  substantial demands
on the government's budget and have led to inflationary  deficit financing
and a 27% depreciation of the cedi in 1994.
