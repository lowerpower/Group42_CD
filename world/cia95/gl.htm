<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult. Unemployment
is  increasing, and prospects for economic growth in the immediate future
are  dim. Following the closing of the Black Angel lead and zinc mine in 1989,
 Greenland became almost completely dependent on fishing and fish  processing,
the sector accounting for 95% of exports. Prospects for  fisheries are not
bright, as the important shrimp catches will at best  stabilize and cod catches
have dropped. Resumption of mining and  hydrocarbon activities is not around
the corner, thus leaving only tourism  with some potential for the near future.
The public sector in Greenland,  i.e., the central government and its commercial
entities and the  municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland accounting
for about  two-thirds of total employment. About half the government's revenues
come  from grants from the Danish Government.
