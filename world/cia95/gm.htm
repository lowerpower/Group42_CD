<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, progress towards economic
 integration between eastern and western Germany is clearly visible, yet the
 eastern region almost certainly will remain dependent on subsidies funded
 by western Germany until well into the next century. The staggering $390
 billion in western German assistance that the eastern states have received
 since 1990 - 40 times the amount in real terms of US Marshall Fund aid sent
 to West Germany after World War II - is just beginning to have an impact
on  the eastern German standard of living, which plummeted after unification.
 Assistance to the east continues to run at roughly $100 billion annually.
 Although the growth rate in the east was much greater than in the west in
 1993-94, eastern GDP per capita nonetheless remains well below  preunification
levels; it will take 10-15 years for the eastern states to  match western
Germany's living standards. The economic recovery in the east  is led by the
construction industries which account for one-third of  industrial output,
with growth increasingly supported by the service  sectors and light manufacturing
industries. Eastern Germany's economy is  changing from one anchored on manufacturing
to a more service-oriented  economy. Western Germany, with three times the
per capita output of the  eastern states, has an advanced market economy and
is a world leader in  exports. The strong recovery in 1994 from recession
began in the export  sector and spread to the investment and consumption sectors
in response to  falling interest rates. Western Germany has a highly urbanized
and skilled  population that enjoys excellent living standards, abundant leisure
time,  and comprehensive social welfare benefits. It is relatively poor in
natural  resources, coal being the most important mineral. Western Germany's
 world-class companies manufacture technologically advanced goods. The  region's
economy is mature: services and manufacturing account for the  dominant share
of economic activities, and raw materials and  semimanufactured goods constitute
a large portion of imports.
