<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.
 It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Tourism
 is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an  increasingly
large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The  traditionally important
sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other  crops, such as bananas (which
now supply about 50% of export earnings),  eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables
and root crops are cultivated for  local consumption, although Guadeloupe
is still dependent on imported food,  which comes mainly from France. Light
industry consists mostly of sugar and  rum production. Most manufactured goods
and fuel are imported. Unemployment  is especially high among the young.
