<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy depends mainly on US military spending and on revenues
from  tourism. Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has grown rapidly,
 creating a construction boom for new hotels and the expansion of older  ones.
Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1992. The slowdown in Japanese  economic
growth has been reflected in less vigorous growth in the tourism  sector.
About 60% of the labor force works for the private sector and the  rest for
government. Most food and industrial goods are imported, with  about 75% from
the US. Guam faces the problem of building up the civilian  economic sector
to offset the impact of military downsizing.
