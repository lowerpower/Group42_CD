<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic entrepreneurial
system  overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that enlarged the public
sector  from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% in 1989. Since then, the public
sector  has been reduced to about 60% of GDP. Tourism continues as a major
source  of foreign exchange, and agriculture is self-sufficient except for
meat,  dairy products, and animal feedstuffs. Over the last decade, real GDP
 growth has averaged 1.6% a year, compared with the European Union average
 of 2.2%. Inflation continues to be well above the EU average, and the  national
debt has reached 140% of GDP, the highest in the EU. Prime  Minister PAPANDREOU
will probably make only limited progress correcting the  economy's problems
of high inflation, large budget deficit, and decaying  infrastructure. His
economic program suggests that although he will shun  his expansionary policies
of the 1980s, he will avoid tough measures needed  to slow inflation or reduce
the state's role in the economy. He has limited  the previous government's
privatization plans, for example, and has called  for generous welfare spending
and real wage increases. Athens continues to  rely heavily on EU aid, which
recently has amounted to about 6% of GDP.  Greece almost certainly will not
meet the EU's Maastricht Treaty  convergence targets of public deficit held
to 3% of GDP and national debt  to 60% of GDP by 1999. Per capita GDP has
fallen below Portugal's level,  the lowest among EU members.
