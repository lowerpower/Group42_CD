<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Although possessing major mineral and hydropower resources and considerable
 potential for agricultural development, Guinea remains one of the poorest
 countries in the world. The agricultural sector contributes about 40% to
 GDP and employs 80% of the work force, while industry accounts for 27% of
 GDP. Guinea possesses over 25% of the world's bauxite reserves. The mining
 sector accounted for 85% of exports in 1991. Long-run improvements in  literacy,
financial institutions, and the legal framework are needed if the  country
is to move out of poverty. Except in the bauxite industry, foreign  investment
remains minimal.
