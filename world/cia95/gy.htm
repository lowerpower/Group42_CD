<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, has
pushed  ahead strongly in 1992-94, with an 8% average annual economic growth
rate,  led by gold mining, and rice, sugar, and forestry products for export.
 Favorable factors include recovery in the key agricultural and mining  sectors,
a more favorable atmosphere for business initiative, a more  realistic exchange
rate, a sharp drop in the inflation rate, and the  continued support of international
organizations. Serious underlying  economic problems will continue. Electric
power has been in short supply  and constitutes a major barrier to future
gains in national output. The  government will have to persist in efforts
to manage its large $2.2 billion  external debt, control inflation, and to
extend the privatization program.
