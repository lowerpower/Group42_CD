<h3>Government</h3>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
 Arrangements ("the DOP"), Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and  responsibilities
to the Palestinian Authority, and subsequently to an  elected Palestinian
Council, as part of interim self-governing arrangements  in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities  for the Gaza Strip
and Jericho has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4  May 1994 Cairo Agreement
on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. The DOP  provides that Israel will
retain responsibility during the transitional  period for external security
and for internal security and public order of  settlements and Israelis. Final
status is to be determined through direct  negotiations within five years.

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> In 1991 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the
border  by Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises,
with  worker remittances supplementing GDP by roughly 50%. Gaza depends upon
 Israel for nearly 90% of its external trade. Aggravating the impact of  Israeli
military administration, unrest in the territory since 1988  (intifadah) has
raised unemployment and lowered the standard of living of  Gazans. The Persian
Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt blows  to Gaza since August
1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf states have  dropped, unemployment
has increased, and exports have fallen. The  withdrawal of Israel from the
Gaza Strip in May 1994 brings a new set of  adjustment problems.
