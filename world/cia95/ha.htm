<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is
mainly  small-scale subsistence farming and employs two-thirds of the work
force.  The majority of the population does not have ready access to safe
drinking  water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. The lack of employment
 opportunities remains one of the most critical problems facing the economy,
 along with soil erosion and political instability. International trade  sanctions
in response to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE  further
damaged the economy. The restoration of President ARISTIDE, the  lifting of
sanctions in late 1994, and foreign aid will alleviate some  economic problems.
Haiti will continue to depend heavily on foreign aid.
