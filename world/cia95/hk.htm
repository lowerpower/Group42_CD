<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff
 barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must
be  imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 17% of GDP. Goods and services
 exports account for about 50% of GDP. Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable
 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2% in 1991,
 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993, and 5.5% in 1994. Unemployment, which has been
 declining since the mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor  continues
to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of living.  Prospects for 1995-96
remain bright so long as major trading partners  continue to be reasonably
prosperous and so long as investors feel China  will support free market practices
after the takeover in 1997.
