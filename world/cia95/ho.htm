<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
 Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for 28% of
 GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces two-thirds of exports.
 Productivity remains low. Manufacturing, still in its early stages, employs
 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15% of GDP, and generates 20% of  exports.
The service sectors, including public administration, account for  50% of
GDP and employ 20% of the labor force. Many basic problems face the  economy,
including rapid population growth, high unemployment, inflation, a  lack of
basic services, a large and inefficient public sector, and the  dependence
of the export sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which are  subject to sharp
price fluctuations. A far-reaching reform program,  initiated by former President
CALLEJAS in 1990 and scaled back by President  REINA, is beginning to take
hold.
