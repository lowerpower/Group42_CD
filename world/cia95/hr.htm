<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia, after
 Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per  capita
output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav average. At present,  Croatian
Serb Separatists control approximately one-third of the Croatian  territory,
and one of the overriding determinants of Croatia's long-term  political and
economic prospects will be the resolution of this territorial  dispute. Croatia
faces serious economic problems stemming from: the legacy  of longtime Communist
mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt;  damage during the fighting
to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings,  and houses; the large refugee
population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and  the disruption of economic ties
to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav  republics, as well as within its
own territory. At the minimum, extensive  Western aid and investment, especially
in the tourist and oil industries,  would seem necessary to revive the moribund
economy. However, peace and  political stability must come first; only then
will recent government moves  toward a "market-friendly" economy restore old
levels of output. As of  February 1995, fighting continues among Croats, Serbs,
and Muslims, and  national boundaries and final political arrangements are
still in doubt.
