<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Since 1989 Hungary has been a leader in the transition from a socialist
 command economy to a market economy - thanks in large part to its initial
 economic reforms during the Communist era. The private sector now accounts
 for about 55% of GDP. Nonetheless, the transformation is proving difficult,
 and many citizens say life was better under the old system. On the bright
 side, the four-year decline in output finally ended in 1994, as real GDP
 increased an estimated 3%. This growth helped reduce unemployment to just
 over 10% by yearend, down from a peak of 13%. However, no progress was made
 against inflation, which remained stuck at about 20%, and the already-large
 current account deficit in the balance of payments actually got worse,  reaching
almost $4 billion. Underlying Hungary's other economic problems is  the large
budget deficit, which probably exceeded 7% of GDP in 1994,  despite some late-year
budget cutting by the new leftist government. In  1995 the government has
pledged to accelerate privatization and lower the  budget deficit to 5.5%
of GDP. It believes this fiscal tightening will  reduce the current account
deficit to $2.5 billion but at the cost of  holding economic growth to only
1%.
