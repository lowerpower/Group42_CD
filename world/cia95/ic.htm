<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic, but
with an  extensive welfare system, relatively low unemployment, and comparatively
 even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the  fishing
industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings and employs  12% of
the work force. In the absence of other natural resources - except  energy
- Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The  economy,
in recession since 1988, began to recover in 1993, posting 0.4%  growth, but
was still hampered by cutbacks in fish quotas as well as  falling world prices
for its main exports: fish and fish products,  aluminum, and ferrosilicon.
Real GDP grew by perhaps 2.4% in 1994. The  center-right government plans
to continue its policies of reducing the  budget and current account deficits,
limiting foreign borrowing, containing  inflation, revising agricultural and
fishing policies, diversifying the  economy, and privatizing state-owned industries.
The government, however,  remains divided on the issue of EU membership, primarily
because of  Icelanders' concern about losing control over their fishing resources.
