<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Indonesia is a mixed economy with some socialist institutions and central
 planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise.
 Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly  increasing
population, it remains a rather poor country. Real GDP growth in  1985-94
averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both  slash underemployment
and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering  the labor force. Agriculture,
including forestry and fishing, is an  important sector, accounting for 21%
of GDP and over 50% of the labor  force. The staple crop is rice. Once the
world's largest rice importer,  Indonesia is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation
crops - rubber and palm  oil - and textiles and plywood are being encouraged
for both export and job  generation. Industrial output now accounts for almost
40% of GDP and is  based on a supply of diverse natural resources, including
crude oil,  natural gas, timber, metals, and coal. Foreign investment has
also boosted  manufacturing output and exports in recent years. Indeed, the
economy's  growth is highly dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil
exports.  Japan remains Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of
aid.  Rapid growth in the money supply in 1989-90 prompted Jakarta to implement
a  tight monetary policy in 1991, forcing the private sector to go to foreign
 banks for investment financing. Real interest rates remained above 10% and
 off-shore commercial debt grew. The growth in off-shore debt prompted  Jakarta
to limit foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the  continued
problems in moving toward a more open financial system and the  persistence
of a fairly tight credit situation, GDP growth in 1992-94 has  matched the
government target of 6%-7% annual growth.
