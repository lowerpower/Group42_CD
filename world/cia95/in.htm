<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming, modern
 agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a  multitude
of support services. Faster economic growth in the 1980s  permitted a significant
increase in real per capita private consumption. A  large share of the population,
perhaps as much as 40%, remains too poor to  afford an adequate diet. Financial
strains in 1990 and 1991 prompted  government austerity measures that slowed
industrial growth but permitted  India to meet its international payment obligations
without rescheduling  its debt. Production, trade, and investment reforms
since 1991 have  provided new opportunities for Indian businessmen and an
estimated 100  million to 200 million middle class consumers. New Delhi has
always paid  its foreign debts on schedule and has stimulated exports, attracted
foreign  investment, and revived confidence in India's economic prospects.
Foreign  exchange reserves, precariously low three years ago, now total more
than  $19 billion. Positive factors for the remainder of the 1990s are India's
 strong entrepreneurial class and the central government's recognition of
 the continuing need for market-oriented approaches to economic development,
 for example in upgrading the wholly inadequate communications facilities.
 Negative factors include the desperate poverty of hundreds of millions of
 Indians and the impact of the huge and expanding population on an already
 overloaded environment.
