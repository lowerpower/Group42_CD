<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of
oil and  other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private
 trading and service ventures. Over the past several years, the government
 has introduced several measures to liberalize the economy and reduce  government
intervention, but most of these changes have moved slowly  because of political
opposition. Iran has faced increasingly severe  financial difficulties since
mid-1992 due to an import surge that began in  1989 and general financial
mismanagement. At yearend 1993 the Iranian  Government estimated that it owed
foreign creditors about $30 billion; an  estimated $8 billion of this debt
was in arrears. At yearend 1994, Iran  rescheduled $12 billion in debt. Earnings
from oil exports - which provide  90% of Iran's export revenues - are providing
less relief to Iran than  usual because of reduced oil prices.
