West Bank entries) Note: The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967
war are not included in  the data below. In keeping with the framework established
at the Madrid  Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations are being
conducted  between Israel and Palestinian representatives, Syria, and Jordan
to  determine the final status of the occupied territories. On 25 April 1982,
 Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace  treaty.
Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan were  resolved in the
26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. </i>

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation.
It  depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military 
equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively  developed
its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.  Industry
employs about 22% of Israeli workers, construction 6.5%,  agriculture, forestry,
and fishing 3.5%, and services most of the rest.  Israel is largely self-sufficient
in food production except for grains.  Diamonds, high-technology equipment,
and agricultural products (fruits and  vegetables) are leading exports. Israel
usually posts current account  deficits, which are covered by large transfer
payments from abroad and by  foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's
external debt is owed to  the United States, which is its major source of
economic and military aid.  To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel has been
targeting high-technology  niches in international markets, such as medical
scanning equipment. The  influx of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR,
which topped 450,000  during the period 1990-94, increased unemployment, intensified
housing  problems, and strained the government budget. At the same time, the
 immigrants bring to the economy valuable scientific and professional  expertise.
