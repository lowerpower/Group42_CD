<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Since World War II the Italian economy has changed from one based on
 agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same
 total and per capita output as France and the UK. The country is still  divided
into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies,  and an
undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public  enterprises. Services
account for 48% of GDP, industry 35%, agriculture 4%,  and public administration
13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and  over 75% of energy requirements
must be imported. After growing at an  average annual rate of 3% in 1983-90,
growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and  1992, fell by 0.7% in 1993, and recovered
to 2% in 1994. In the second half  of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect
of not qualifying to  participate in EU plans for economic and monetary union
later in the  decade; thus it finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances.
 Subsequently, the government has adopted fairly stringent budgets,  abandoned
its highly inflationary wage indexation system, and started to  scale back
its extremely generous social welfare programs, including  pension and health
care benefits. Monetary officials were forced to  withdraw the lira from the
European monetary system in September 1992 when  it came under extreme pressure
in currency markets. For the 1990s, Italy  faces the problems of pushing ahead
with fiscal reform, refurbishing a  tottering communications system, curbing
pollution in major industrial  centers, and adjusting to the new competitive
forces accompanying the  ongoing expansion and economic integration of the
European Union.
