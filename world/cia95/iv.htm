<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and exporters
of  coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is
 highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and 
cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to  diversify,
the economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and  related industries.
After several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian  economy began a comeback
in 1994, due to improved prices for cocoa and  coffee, growth in non-traditional
primary exports such as pineapples and  rubber, trade and banking liberalization,
offshore oil and gas discoveries,  and generous external financing and debt
rescheduling by multilateral  lenders and France. The 50% devaluation in January
1994 caused a one time  jump in the inflation rate. Government adherence to
a renewed structural  adjustment program has led to a budget surplus for the
first time in  several years, a smaller personnel budget, and an increase
in public  investment. While real growth in 1994 was only 1.5%, the IMF and
World Bank  expect it will surpass 6% in 1995.
