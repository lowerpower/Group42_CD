<h3>Geography</h3>

<p>
<b>Location:</b> Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf, between Iran and Kuwait 

<p>
<b>Map references:</b> Middle East  

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total area:</i> 437,072 sq km  
<br><i>land area:</i> 432,162 sq km  
<br><i>comparative area:</i> slightly more than twice the size of Idaho 

<p>
<b>Land boundaries:</b> total 3,631 km, Iran 1,458 km, Jordan 181 km, Kuwait 242 km, Saudi
Arabia  814 km, Syria 605 km, Turkey 331 km  

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 58 km  

<p>
<b>Maritime claims:</b> 
<br><i>continental shelf:</i> not specified 
<br><i>territorial sea:</i> 12 nm 

<p>
<b>International disputes:</b> Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in 1990 but are still trying
to  work out written agreements settling outstanding disputes from their 
eight-year war concerning border demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom
 of navigation and sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; in November
 1994, Iraq formally accepted the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which had
 been spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773 (1993),
 and 883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and to Bubiyan
 and Warbah islands; potential dispute over water development plans by  Turkey
for the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers 

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> mostly desert; mild to cool winters with dry, hot, cloudless summers;
 northern mountainous regions along Iranian and Turkish borders experience
 cold winters with occasionally heavy snows which melt in early spring,  sometimes
causing extensive flooding in central and southern Iraq 

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> mostly broad plains; reedy marshes along Iranian border in south; mountains
 along borders with Iran and Turkey 

<p>
<b>Natural resources:</b> petroleum, natural gas, phosphates, sulfur  

<p>
<b>Land use:</b> 
<br><i>arable land:</i> 12%  
<br><i>permanent crops:</i> 1%  
<br><i>meadows and pastures:</i> 9%  
<br><i>forest and woodland:</i> 3%  
<br><i>other:</i> 75%  

<p>
<b>Irrigated land:</b> 25,500 sq km (1989 est) 

<p>
<b>Environment:</b> 
<br><i>current issues:</i> government water control projects have drained most of the inhabited
marsh  areas west of Al Qurnah by drying up or diverting the feeder streams
and  rivers; a once sizable population of Shi'a Muslims, who have inhabited
 these areas for thousands of years, has been displaced; furthermore, the
 destruction of the natural habitat poses serious threats to the area's  wildlife
populations; inadequate supplies of potable water; development of  Tigris-Euphrates
Rivers system contingent upon agreements with upstream  riparian Turkey; air
and water pollution; soil degradation (salinization)  and erosion; desertification 

<br><i>natural hazards:</i> duststorms, sandstorms, floods 
<br><i>international agreements:</i> party to - Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban; signed, but not ratified
-  Environmental Modification

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning and management
of  industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some small-scale
 industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. The  economy
has been dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally  provided about
95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial  problems caused
by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and  damage to oil
export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement  austerity measures
and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt  payments. After the
end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually  increased with the construction
of new pipelines and restoration of damaged  facilities. Agricultural development
remained hampered by labor shortages,  salinization, and dislocations caused
by previous land reform and  collectivization programs. The industrial sector,
although accorded high  priority by the government, also was under financial
constraints. Iraq's  seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international
economic  embargoes, and military action by an international coalition beginning
in  January 1991 drastically changed the economic picture. Industrial and
 transportation facilities, which suffered severe damage, have been  partially
restored. Oil exports remain at less than 5% of the previous  level. Shortages
of spare parts continue. Living standards deteriorated  even further in 1993
and 1994; consumer prices have more than doubled in  both 1993 and 1994. The
UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports  and imports and has contributed
to the sharp rise in prices. The Iraqi  government has been unwilling to abide
by UN resolutions so that the  economic embargo can be removed. The government's
policies of supporting  large military and internal security forces and of
allocating resources to  key supporters of the regime have exacerbated shortages.
In brief, per  capita output in 1993-94 is far below the 1989-90 level, but
no precise  estimate is available.
