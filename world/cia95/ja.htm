<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high
 technology, and a comparatively small defense allocation (roughly 1% of 
GDP) have helped Japan advance with extraordinary rapidity to the rank of
 second most powerful economy in the world. Industry, the most important 
sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
 fuels. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its
 requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the
 world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global
 catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the
 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic growth came to a halt
 in 1992-93 largely because of contractionary domestic policies intended to
 wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Growth
 resumed at a 0.6% pace in 1994 largely because of consumer demand. As for
 foreign trade, the stronger yen and slower global growth are containing 
export growth. Unemployment and inflation remain remarkably low in  comparison
with the other industrialized nations. Japan continues to run a  huge trade
surplus - $121 billion in 1994, roughly the same size as in 1993  - which
supports extensive investment in foreign assets. Prime Minister  MURAYAMA
has yet to formalize his government's plans for administrative and  economic
reform, including reduction in the trade surplus. As leader of a  coalition
government, he has softened his own socialist positions. The  crowding of
the habitable land area and the aging of the population are two  major long-run
problems.
