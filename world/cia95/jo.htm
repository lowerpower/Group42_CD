<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the
late  1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth averaged more
than  10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab
aid  and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an average of roughly
 2% per year. Imports - mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and
 food - outstripped exports, with the difference covered by aid,  remittances,
and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began  debt-rescheduling
negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF-supported  program designed to
gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly  needed structural
reforms. The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August  1990, however, aggravated
Jordan's already serious economic problems,  forcing the government to shelve
the IMF program, stop most debt payments,  and suspend rescheduling negotiations.
Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker  remittances, and trade contracted; and
refugees flooded the country,  producing serious balance-of-payments problems,
stunting GDP growth, and  straining government resources. The economy rebounded
in 1992, largely due  to the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning
from the Gulf,  but the recovery was uneven throughout 1994. The government
is implementing  the reform program adopted in 1992 and continues to secure
rescheduling and  write-offs of its heavy foreign debt. Debt, poverty, and
unemployment  remain Jordan's biggest on-going problems.
