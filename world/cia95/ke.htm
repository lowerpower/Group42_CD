<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Kenya in recent years has had one of the highest natural rates of growth
in  population, but the statistics have been complicated by the large-scale
 movement of nomadic groups and of Somalis back and forth across the border.
 Population growth has been accompanied by deforestation, deterioration in
 the road system, the water supply, and other parts of the infrastructure.
 In industry and services, Nairobi's reluctance to embrace IMF-supported 
reforms had held back investment and growth in 1991-93. Nairobi's push on
 economic reform in 1994, however, helped support a 3.3% increase in output.
