<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Kyrgyzstan is one of the smallest and poorest states of the former
Soviet  Union. Its economy is heavily agricultural, growing cotton and tobacco
on  irrigated land in the south and grain in the foothills of the north and
 raising sheep and goats on mountain pastures. Its small and obsolescent 
industrial sector, concentrated around Bishkek, has traditionally relied on
 Russia and other CIS countries for customers and industrial inputs,  including
most of its fuel. Since 1990, the economy has contracted by  almost 50% as
subsidies from Moscow vanished and trade links with other  former Soviet republics
eroded. At the same time, the Kyrgyz government  stuck to tight monetary and
fiscal policies in 1994 that succeeded in  reducing inflation from 23% per
month in 1993 to 5.4% per month in 1994.  Moreover, Kyrgyzstan has been the
most successful of the Central Asian  states in reducing state controls over
the economy and privatizing state  industries. Nevertheless, restructuring
proved to be a slow and painful  process in 1994 despite relatively large
flows of foreign aid and continued  progress on economic reform. The decline
in output in 1995 may be much  smaller, perhaps 5%, compared with an estimated
24% in 1994.
