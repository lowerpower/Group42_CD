<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land
is  collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods.
 State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist
 country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the
 strict rule of KIM Il-song in the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il.  Economic
growth during the period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output  declined by 3%-5%
annually during 1989-92 because of systemic problems and  disruptions in socialist-style
economic relations with the former USSR and  China. In 1992, output dropped
sharply, by perhaps 7%-9%, as the economy  felt the cumulative effect of the
reduction in outside support. The  leadership insisted on maintaining its
high level of military outlays from  a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a
serious drawdown in inventories and  critical shortages in the energy sector
have led to increasing  interruptions in industrial production. Abundant mineral
resources and  hydropower have formed the basis of industrial development
since World War  II. Output of the extractive industries includes coal, iron
ore, magnesite,  graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals. Manufacturing
is  centered on heavy industry, including military industry, with light  industry
lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties,  expansion
of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has  not yet
become self-sufficient in food production. Indeed, a shortage of  arable lands,
several years of poor harvests, and a cumbersome distribution  system have
resulted in chronic food shortages. The collapse of Communism  in the former
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1989-91 has disrupted  important technological
links. North Korea remains far behind South Korea  in economic development
and living standards. GDP is stagnant.
