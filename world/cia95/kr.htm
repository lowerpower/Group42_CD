<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls, Kiribati has few national
 resources. Commercially viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the 
time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of  production
and exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years.  Real GDP
declined about 5% in 1987, as the fish catch fell sharply to only  one-fourth
the level of 1986 and copra production was hampered by repeated  rains. Output
rebounded strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 10%. The  upturn in economic
growth came from an increase in copra production and a  good fish catch. GDP
then fell by 2.2% in 1989 and by 2.9% in 1990, but has  risen by about 3%
annually in 1991-93. Foreign financial aid, largely from  the UK and Japan,
is a critical supplement to GDP, amounting to 25%-50% of  GDP in recent years.
