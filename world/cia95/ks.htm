<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has been the
planned  development of an export-oriented economy in a vigorously entrepreneurial
 society. Real GDP increased more than 10% annually between 1986 and 1991.
 This growth ultimately led to an overheated situation characterized by a
 tight labor market, strong inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising 
current account deficit. As a result, in 1992, economic policy focused on
 slowing the growth rate of inflation and reducing the deficit. Annual  growth
slowed to 5%, still above the rate in most other countries of the  world,
and recovered to 6.3% in 1993. The economy expanded by 8.3% in 1994,  driven
by booming exports.
