 Kuwait which had been spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687  (1991),
773 (1993), and 883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to  Kuwait and

 amounts of rain which can damage roads and houses; sandstorms and  duststorms
occur throughout the year, but are most common between March and  August

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with proved crude oil
 reserves of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world reserves. Kuwait has
 rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its crude oil production reached
 at least 2.0 million barrels per day by the end of 1993. The government ran
 a sizable fiscal deficit in 1993. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP
 and 90% of export and government revenues. Kuwait lacks water and has  practically
no arable land, thus preventing development of agriculture.  With the exception
of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About  75% of potable water
must be distilled or imported. Because of its high per  capita income, comparable
with Western European incomes, Kuwait provides  its citizens with extensive
health, educational, and retirement benefits.  Per capita military expenditures
are among the highest in the world. The  economy improved moderately in 1994,
with the growth in industry and  finance, and should see further gains in
1995, especially if oil prices go  up. The World Bank has urged Kuwait to
push ahead with privatization,  including in the oil industry, but the government
will move slowly on this  front.
