km)

<b>Environment:</b> 
<br><i>current issues:</i> radioactive or toxic chemical sites associated with its former defense
 industries and test ranges are found throughout the country and pose health
 risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution is severe in some  cities;
because the two main rivers which flowed into the Aral Sea have  been diverted
for irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a harmful  layer of chemical
pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then  picked up by the
wind and blown into noxious dust storms; pollution in the  Caspian Sea; soil
pollution from overuse of agricultural chemicals and  salinization from faulty
irrigation practices

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet states in territory,
 possesses enormous untapped fossil-fuel reserves as well as plentiful  supplies
of other minerals and metals. It also has considerable  agricultural potential
with its vast steppe lands accommodating both  livestock and grain production.
Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the  extraction and processing of
these natural resources and also on a  relatively large machine building sector
specializing in construction  equipment, tractors, agricultural machinery,
and some defense items. The  breakup of the USSR and the collapse of demand
for Kazakhstan's traditional  heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp
contraction of the economy  since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring
in 1994. The  government has pursued a moderate program of economic reform
and  privatization which is gradually lifting state controls over economic
 activity and shifting assets into the private sector. Nevertheless,  government
control over key sectors of the economy remains strong.  Sustained economic
hardships and continued pressures from industrial elites  will make it difficult
for the government to sustain its policies of  monetary and fiscal discipline
which had brought down inflation by the end  of 1994. Continued lack of pipeline
transportation for expanded oil exports  has closed off a likely source of
economic recovery.
