<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The government of Laos - one of the few remaining official Communist
states  - has been decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise
since  1986. The results, starting from an extremely low base, have been striking
 - growth has averaged 7.5% annually since 1988. Even so, Laos is a  landlocked
country with a primitive infrastructure. It has no railroads, a  rudimentary
road system, and limited external and internal  telecommunications. Electricity
is available in only a few urban areas.  Subsistence agriculture accounts
for half of GDP and provides 80% of total  employment. The predominant crop
is rice. In non-drought years, Laos is  self-sufficient overall in food, but
each year flood, pests, and localized  drought cause shortages in various
parts of the country. For the  foreseeable future the economy will continue
to depend on aid from the IMF  and other international sources; aid from the
former USSR and Eastern  Europe has been cut sharply. As in many developing
countries, deforestation  and soil erosion will hamper efforts to maintain
the high rate of GDP  growth.
