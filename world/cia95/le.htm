<p> <a href="index.htm">Lebanon </a></h1>
<p><i>Note--Lebanon has made progress
toward rebuilding its political institutions and  regaining its national sovereignty
since the end of the devastating 16-year  civil war which began in 1975. Under
the Ta'if accord - the blueprint for  national reconciliation - the Lebanese
have established a more equitable  political system, particularly by giving
Muslims a greater say in the  political process. Since December 1990, the
Lebanese have formed three  cabinets and conducted the first legislative election
in 20 years. Most of  the militias have been weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese
Armed Forces  (LAF) has seized vast quantities of weapons used by the militias
during the  war and extended central government authority over about one-half
of the  country. Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, retains most of its weapons.
 Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops in
 southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, The Army of  South
Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous to its  border.
The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared security zone and  about
20 kilometers north to the strategic town of Jazzine. As of December  1993,
Syria maintained about 30,000-35,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops  are
based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's  deployment
was legitimized by the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war  and in the
Ta'if accord. Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's  requests,
and failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the  constitutional
reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far refused to  withdraw its
troops from Beirut. </i>

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The 1975-1991 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's economic  infrastructure,
cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's  position as a Middle
Eastern entrepot and banking hub. A tentative peace  has enabled the central
government to begin restoring control in Beirut,  collect taxes, and regain
access to key port and government facilities. The  battered economy has also
been propped up by a financially sound banking  system and resilient small-
and medium-scale manufacturers. Family  remittances, banking transactions,
manufactured and farm exports, the  narcotics trade, and international emergency
aid are the main sources of  foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year
of 1991, industrial  production, agricultural output, and exports showed substantial
gains. The  further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country was delayed in 1992
because  of an upturn in political wrangling. In October 1992, Rafiq HARIRI
was  appointed Prime Minister. HARIRI, a wealthy entrepreneur, announced 
ambitious plans for Lebanon's reconstruction which involve a substantial 
influx of foreign aid and investment. Progress on restoring basic services
 is limited. Since Prime Minister HARIRI's appointment, the most significant
 improvement lies in the stabilization of the Lebanese pound, which had  gained
over 30% in value by yearend 1993. The years 1993 and 1994 were  marked by
efforts of the new administration to encourage domestic and  foreign investment
and to obtain additional international assistance. The  construction sector
led the 8.5% advance in real GDP in 1994.
