<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Since independence in September 1991, Lithuania has made steady progress
in  developing a market economy. Almost 50% of state property has been  privatized
and trade is diversifying with a gradual shift away from the  former Soviet
Union to Western markets. In addition, the Lithuanian  government has adhered
to a disciplined budgetary and financial policy  which has brought inflation
down from a monthly average of around 14% in  first half 1993 to an average
of 3.1% in 1994. Nevertheless, the process  has been painful with industrial
output in 1993 less than half the 1991  level. The economy appeared to have
bottomed out in 1994, and Vilnius's  policies have laid the groundwork for
vigorous recovery over the next few  years. Recovery will build on Lithuanian's
strategic location with its  ice-free port at Klaipeda and its rail and highway
hub in Vilnius  connecting it with Eastern Europe, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine,
and on its  agriculture potential, highly skilled labor force, and diversified
 industrial sector. Lacking important natural resources, it will remain  dependent
on imports of fuels and raw materials.
