<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially
 the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Businessmen have fled the  country,
taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return.  Richly endowed
with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate  favorable to agriculture,
Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic  products, while local manufacturing,
mainly foreign owned, had been small  in scope. Political instability threatens
prospects for economic  reconstruction and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian
refugees who have  fled to neighboring countries. The political impasse between
the interim  government and rebel leader Charles TAYLOR has prevented restoration
of  normal economic life, including the re-establishment of a strong central
 government with effective economic development programs. The economy  deteriorated
further in 1994.
