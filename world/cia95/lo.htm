<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> In 1994 macroeconomic performance improved steadily but privatization
 progressed only in fits and starts. Most of Slovakia's IMF-approved targets
 were met by an interim government that lasted 9 months. Annual inflation
 fell from 23% in 1993 to 12%; unemployment at 14.6% was still well below
 forecasts of 17%; and the budget deficit was around half that in 1993.  Slovakia's
nearly $200 million trade surplus also compares favorably with a  more than
$800 million deficit in 1993. Furthermore, after contracting  almost 25% in
the three years following 1990, GDP grew 4.3% in 1994,  according to official
statistics. Bratislava in June qualified for a $254  million IMF stand-by
loan and the second $90 million tranche of its  Systemic Transformation Facility
and, in December, received approval for a  European Union loan worth about
$160 million. By the end of September 1994,  the Central Bank's foreign currency
reserves had tripled since the end of  1993. Slovakia continued to have difficulty
attracting foreign investment,  however, because of perceived political instability
and halting progress in  privatization. The interim government prepared property
worth nearly $2  billion for the second wave of coupon privatization and sold
participation  in the program to over 80% of Slovakia's eligible citizens.
Parties  controlling the new Parliament in November 1994, however, put the
second  wave of coupon privatization on hold and suspended sales of 38 firms
until  the new government could evaluate the interim government's decisions
in  early 1995. The new government's targets for 1995 include GDP growth of
3%,  inflation of 8%-10%, unemployment of 15%, and a budget deficit under
3% of  GDP. Continuing economic recovery in western Europe should boost Slovak
 exports and production, but Slovakia's image with foreign creditors and 
investors could suffer setbacks in 1995 if progress on privatization stalls
 or budget deficits mount beyond IMF-recommended levels.
