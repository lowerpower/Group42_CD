<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein
has  developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized, free-enterprise economy
 with a vital service sector and living standards on par with its large  European
neighbors. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and  easy incorporation
rules have induced about 25,000 holding or so-called  letter box companies
to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein,  providing 30% of state revenues.
The country participates in a customs  union with Switzerland and uses the
Swiss franc as its national currency.  Liechtenstein plans to join the European
Economic Area (an organization  serving as a bridge between EFTA and EU) in
1995.
