<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
 resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light  manufacturing,
and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa  (these remittances
supplement domestic income by as much as 45%). The great  majority of households
gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming and  migrant labor; a large
portion of the adult male work force is employed in  South African mines.
Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to  support the milling, canning,
leather, and jute industries; other  industries include textile, clothing,
and construction. Although drought  has decreased agricultural activity over
the past few years, improvement of  a major hydropower facility will permit
the sale of water to South Africa  and allow Lesotho's economy to continue
its moderate growth.
