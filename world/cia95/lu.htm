<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The stable, prosperous economy features moderate growth, low inflation,
and  negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small but highly  productive
family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently  dominated by steel,
has become increasingly more diversified, particularly  toward high-technology
firms. During the past decade, growth in the  financial sector has more than
compensated for the decline in steel.  Services, especially banking, account
for a growing proportion of the  economy. Luxembourg participates in an economic
union with Belgium on trade  and most financial matters, is also closely connected
economically to the  Netherlands, and as a member of the 15-member European
Union enjoys the  advantages of the open European market.
