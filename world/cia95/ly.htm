<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from
the oil  sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and about
 one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at  $5,410,
but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuated sharply in response  to changes
in the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient  resource allocations
have led to periodic shortages of basic goods and  foodstuffs. Windfall revenues
from the hike in world oil prices in late  1990 improved the foreign payments
position and resulted in a current  account surplus through 1992. The nonoil
manufacturing and construction  sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP,
have expanded from processing  mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals,
iron, steel, and  aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP,
it employs 18%  of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely
limit farm  output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements.
The UN  sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not yet had a major impact on
the  economy because Libya's oil revenues generate sufficient foreign exchange
 which sustains imports of food, consumer goods, and equipment for the oil
 industry and ongoing development projects.
