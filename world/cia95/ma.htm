<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, suffering
from  chronic malnutrition, underfunded health and education facilities, a
3%  annual population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied
 by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay
of  the economy, accounting for over 30% of GDP and contributing more than
70%  of total export earnings. Industry is largely confined to the processing
of  agricultural products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted
for  only 13% of GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year development
 plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990,  increased
production for exports, and reduced energy imports. Subsequently,  growth
in output has been held back because of protracted antigovernment  strikes
and demonstrations for political reform. Since 1993, corruption and  political
instability have caused the economy and infrastructure to decay  further.
Since April 1994, the government commitment to economic reforms  has been
erratic. Enormous obstacles stand in the way of Madagascar's  realizing its
considerable growth potential.
