<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light industry.
 Agriculture accounts for about 10% of GDP and the small industrial sector
 for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used
 for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to
 France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be  imported,
contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large  annual transfers
of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than  agricultural exports
as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the  work force is employed
in the service sector and in administration. Banana  workers launched protests
late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and  fears of greater competition
in the European market from other producers.
