<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has no major
 mineral deposits. As a result, Moldova's economy is primarily based on  agriculture,
featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova must  import all
of its supplies of oil, coal, and natural gas, and energy  shortages have
contributed to sharp production declines since the breakup  of the Soviet
Union in 1991. The Moldovan government is making steady  progress on an ambitious
economic reform agenda, and the IMF has called  Moldova a model for the region.
As part of its reform efforts, Chisinau has  introduced a stable currency,
freed all prices, stopped issuing  preferential credits to state enterprises
and backed their steady  privatization, removed export controls, and freed
interest rates. Chisinau  appears strongly committed to continuing these reforms
in 1995. Meanwhile,  privatization of medium and large enterprises got underway
in mid-1994 and  is expected to pick up speed in 1995. To improve its precarious
energy  situation, Chisinau reached an agreement with Moscow in December 1994
on  gas deliveries for 1995. Gazprom, Russia's national gas company, has agreed
 to reduce prices for natural gas deliveries to Moldova from the world  market
price of $80/thousand cubic meters (tcm) to $58/tcm in return for  part ownership
of the Moldovan pipeline system.
