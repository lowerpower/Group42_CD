<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses
of  unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic activity
 traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock.
 In past years extensive mineral resources had been developed with Soviet
 support; total Soviet assistance at its height amounted to 30% of GDP. The
 mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold
 account for a large part of industrial production. Timber and fishing are
 also important sectors. The Mongolian leadership has been gradually making
 the transition from Soviet-style central planning to a market economy  through
privatization and price reform, and is soliciting support from  international
financial agencies and foreign investors. The economy,  however, has still
not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid, and the  country continues to suffer
substantial economic hardships, with one-fourth  of the population below the
poverty line.
