<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least developed countries.
The  economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90% of the population
 living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP and 90% of  export
revenues. After two years of weak performance, economic growth  improved significantly
in 1988-91 as a result of good weather and a broadly  based economic adjustment
effort by the government. Drought cut overall  output sharply in 1992, but
the lost ground was recovered in 1993. The  economy depends on substantial
inflows of economic assistance from the IMF,  the World Bank, and individual
donor nations. The new government faces  strong challenges, e.g., to spur
exports, to improve educational and health  facilities, and to deal with environmental
problems of deforestation and  erosion.
