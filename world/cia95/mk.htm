<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although the poorest republic
in  the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and energy needs 
through its own agricultural and coal resources. Its economic decline will
 continue unless ties are reforged or enlarged with its neighbors Serbia and
 Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside
 sources for all of its oil and gas and most of its modern machinery and 
parts. An important supplement of GDP is the remittances from thousands of
 Macedonians working in Germany and other West European nations. Continued
 political turmoil, both internally and in the region as a whole, prevents
 any swift readjustments of trade patterns and economic programs. The  country's
industrial output and GDP are expected to decline further in  1995. The Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's geographical isolation,  technological backwardness,
and potential political instability place it  far down the list of countries
of interest to Western investors. Resolution  of the dispute with Greece and
an internal commitment to economic reform  would encourage foreign investment
over the long run. In the immediate  future, the worst scenario for the economy
would be the spread of fighting  across its borders.
