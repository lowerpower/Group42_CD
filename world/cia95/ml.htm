<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Mali is among the poorest countries in the world, with 65% of its land
area  desert or semidesert. Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine
 area irrigated by the Niger. About 10% of the population is nomadic and 
some 80% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture and fishing.  Industrial
activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. The  economy is beginning
to turn around after contracting through 1992-93,  largely because of enhanced
exports and import substitute production in the  wake of the 50% devaluation
of January 1994. Post-devaluation inflation  appears to have peaked at 35%
in 1994 and the government appears to be  keeping on track with its IMF structural
adjustment program.
