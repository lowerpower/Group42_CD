<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort,
 attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The Principality
 has successfully sought to diversify into services and small,  high-value-added,
nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and  low business taxes
and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have  established residence
and for foreign companies that have set up businesses  and offices. About
50% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added  taxes on hotels, banks,
and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue  comes from tourism. Living
standards are high, that is, roughly comparable  to those in prosperous French
metropolitan suburbs.
