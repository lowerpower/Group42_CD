<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Morocco faces the typical problems of developing countries - restraining
 government spending, reducing constraints on private activity and foreign
 trade, and keeping inflation within bounds. Since the early 1980s the  government
has pursued an economic program toward these objectives with the  support
of the IMF, the World Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The  economy
has substantial assets to draw on: the world's largest phosphate  reserves,
diverse agricultural and fishing resources, a sizable tourist  industry, a
growing manufacturing sector, and remittances from Moroccans  working abroad.
A severe drought in 1992-93 depressed economic activity and  held down exports.
Real GDP contracted by 4.4% in 1992 and 1.1% in 1993.  Despite these setbacks,
initiatives to relax capital controls, strengthen  the banking sector, and
privatize state enterprises went forward in  1993-94. Favorable rainfall in
1994 boosted agricultural production by 40%.  Servicing the large debt, high
unemployment, and vulnerability to external  economic forces remain long-term
problems for Morocco.
