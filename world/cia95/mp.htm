<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed from a low income,
 agriculturally based economy to middle income diversified economy with  growing
industrial and tourist sectors. For most of the period annual  growth has
been of the order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has  been reflected
in increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and  a much improved
infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the  cultivated land area
and accounts for 40% of export earnings. The  government's development strategy
centers on industrialization (with a view  to modernization and to exports),
agricultural diversification, and  tourism. Economic performance in 1991-93
continued strong with solid real  growth and low unemployment.
