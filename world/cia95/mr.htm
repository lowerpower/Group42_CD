<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and livestock
for  a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
 were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.
 Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50%
 of total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has
 led to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the
 richest fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners  threatens
this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port  opened near
Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and economic  mismanagement have
resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt. The  government has begun
the second stage of an economic reform program in  consultation with the World
Bank, the IMF, and major donor countries.  Short-term growth prospects are
gloomy because of the heavy debt service  burden, rapid population growth,
and vulnerability to climatic conditions.
