<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic location,
and a  productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs,
 has limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy sources.  Consequently,
the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and  services. Manufacturing
and tourism are the largest contributors to the  economy. Manufacturing accounts
for about 24% of GDP, with the electronics  and textile industries major contributors
and with the state-owned Malta  drydocks employing about 4,300 people. In
1994, over 1,000,000 tourists  visited the island. Per capita GDP of $10,760
places Malta in the range of  the less affluent EU countries.
