<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes of the oil industry,
 including trends in international oil prices and the ability of OPEC  producers
to agree on output quotas. Petroleum accounts for more than 85%  of export
earnings, about 80% of government revenues, and roughly 40% of  GDP. Oman
has proved oil reserves of 4 billion barrels, equivalent to about  20 years'
supply at the current rate of extraction. Agriculture is carried  on at a
subsistence level and the general population depends on imported  food. The
government is encouraging private investment, both domestic and  foreign,
as a prime force for further economic development.
