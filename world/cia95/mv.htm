<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Fishing is the largest industry, employing 25% of the work force and
 accounting for over 60% of exports. Over 90% of government tax revenue  comes
from import duties and tourism-related taxes. During the 1980s  tourism became
one of the most important and highest growth sectors of the  economy. In 1993,
tourism accounted for 17% of GDP and more than 60% of the  Maldives' foreign
exchange receipts. The Maldivian government initiated an  economic reform
program in 1989 initially by lifting import quotas and  opening some exports
to the private sector. Subsequently, it has  liberalized regulations to allow
more foreign investment. Agriculture and  manufacturing continue to play a
minor role in the economy, constrained by  the limited availability of cultivatable
land and the shortage of domestic  labor. Most staple foods must be imported.
In 1993, industry which  consisted mainly of garment production, boat building,
and handicrafts  accounted for about 6% of GDP.
