<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Mexico, under the guidance of new President Ernesto ZEDILLO, entered
1995  in the midst of a severe financial crisis. Mexico's membership in the
North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada,
 its solid record of economic reforms, and its strong growth in the second
 and third quarters of 1994 - at an annual rate of 3.8% and 4.5%  respectively
- seemed to augur bright prospects for 1995. However, an  overvalued exchange
rate and widening current account deficits created an  imbalance that ultimately
proved unsustainable. To finance the trade gap,  Mexico City had become increasingly
reliant on volatile portfolio  investment. A series of political shocks in
1994 - an uprising in the  southern state of Chiapas, the assassination of
a presidential candidate,  several high profile kidnappings, the killing of
a second high-level  political figure, and renewed threats from the Chiapas
rebels - combined  with rising international interest rates and concerns of
a devaluation to  undermine investor confidence and prompt massive outflows
of capital. The  dwindling of foreign exchange reserves, which the central
bank had been  using to defend the currency, forced the new administration
to change the  exchange rate policy and allow the currency to float freely
in the last  days of 1994. The adjustment roiled Mexican financial markets,
leading to a  30% to 40% weakening of the peso relative to the dollar. ZEDILLO
announced  an emergency economic program that included federal budget cuts
and plans  for more privatizations, but it failed to restore investor confidence
 quickly. While the devaluation is likely to help Mexican exporters, whose
 products are now cheaper, it also raises the specter of an inflationary 
spiral if domestic producers increase their prices and workers demand wage
 hikes. Although strong economic fundamentals bode well for Mexico's  longer-term
outlook, prospects for solid growth and low inflation have  deteriorated considerably,
at least through 1995.
