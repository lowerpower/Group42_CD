<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Malaysian economy, a mixture of private enterprise and a soundly
 managed public sector, has posted a remarkable record of 9% average annual
 growth in 1988-94. The official growth target for 1995 is 8.5%. This growth
 has resulted in a substantial reduction in poverty and a marked rise in 
real wages. Manufactured goods exports expanded rapidly, and foreign  investors
continued to commit large sums in the economy. The government is  aware of
the inflationary potential of this rapid development and is  closely monitoring
fiscal and monetary policies.
