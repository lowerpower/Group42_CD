<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit
the  economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and  transportation
resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and  investment declined
throughout the first half of the 1980s because of  internal disorders, lack
of government administrative control, and a  growing foreign debt. A sharp
increase in foreign aid, attracted by an  economic reform policy, resulted
in successive years of economic growth in  the late 1980s, but aid has declined
steadily since 1989. Agricultural  output is at only 75% of its 1981 level,
and grain has to be imported.  Industry operates at only 20%-40% of capacity.
The economy depends heavily  on foreign assistance to keep afloat. Peace accords
signed in October 1992  improved chances of foreign investment, aided IMF-supported
economic  reforms, and supported continued economic recovery. Elections held
in 1994  diverted government attention from the economy, resulting in slippage
and  delays in the economic reform program. Nonetheless, growth in 1994 was
 solid and can continue into the late 1990s given continued foreign help in
 meeting debt obligations.
