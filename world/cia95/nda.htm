<hr>
There have been some significant changes in this edition. The Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands became the independent nation of Palau. The
gross domestic product (GDP) of all countries is now presented on a purchasing
power parity (PPP) basis rather than on the old exchange rate basis. There
is a new entry on Age structure and the Airports entry now includes unpaved
runways. The Communications category has been restructured and now includes
the entries of Telephone system, Radio, and Television. The remainder of the
entries in the former Communications category-Railroads, Highways, Inland
waterways, Pipelines, Ports, Merchant marine, and Airports-can now be found
under a new category called Transportation. There is a new appendix listing
estimates of gross domestic product on an exchange rate basis for all nations.
A reference map of the Republic of South Africa is included. The electronic
files used to produce the Factbook have been restructured into a database.
As a result, the formats of some entries in this edition have been changed.
Additional changes will occur in the 1996 Factbook.

 <B>Administrative divisions:  </B>
 The numbers, designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions
are generally those approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes
that have been reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.  
 <P>
 <B>Airports: </B>
 Only airports with usable runways are included in this listing. For
airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is included. Not
all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.
Paved runways have concrete or asphalt surfaces; unpaved runways have grass,
dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces.  
 <P>
 <B>Area:  </B>
 Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by international
boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited
by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water bodies
(lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas are based on total area equivalents.
Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The
smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or
The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).  
 <P>
 <B>Birth rate:  </B>
 The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 population
at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. Dates of information: In general,
information available as of 1 January 1995 is used in the preparation of this
edition. Population figures are estimates for 1 July 1995, with population
growth rates estimated for calendar year 1995. Major political events have
been updated through April 1995.  
 <P>
 <B>Death rate:  </B>
 The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000 population
at midyear; also known as crude death rate.  
 <P>
 <B>Digraphs:  </B>
 The digraph is a two-letter "country code" that precisely identifies
every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is
the digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized geopolitical data element
promulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)
10-3 by the National Bureau of Standards (now called National Institute of
Standards and Technology) at the US Department of Commerce and maintained
by the Office of the Geographer at the US Department of State. The digraph
is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,
and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging
data between databases.  
 <P>
 <B>Diplomatic representation:  </B>
 The US Government has diplomatic relations with 184 nations, including
178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
North Korea, former Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In addition, the US has
diplomatic relations with 6 nations that are not in the UN - Holy See, Kiribati,
Nauru, Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.  
 <P>
 <B>Economic aid:  </B>
 This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development assistance
(ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is defined as financial assistance
which is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote economic
development and welfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least
25%. OOF transactions are also official government assistance, but with a
main objective other than development and with a grant element less than 25%.
OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits),
official equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the official
sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to have been
committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and constitute
a formal declaration of intent. 
 <P>
 <B>Entities:  </B>
 Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,
and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others
are not officially recognized by the US Government. "Nation" refers to a people
politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory. "Dependent
area" refers to a broad category of political entities that are associated
in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form
names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are 266 entities
in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

<p>
<B>Exchange rate: </B>
<BR>The official value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over
a given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US dollar
and as determined by international market forces or official fiat. 
<P>
<B>GDP methodology: </B>
 In the "Economy" section, GDP dollar estimates for all countries are
derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from conversions
at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method normally involves the
use of international dollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities
of goods and services produced in a given economy. In addition to the lack
of reliable data from the majority of countries, the statistician faces a
major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing for the quality
of goods and services. The division of a GDP estimate in local currency by
the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. On
average, one thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in
the US as one thousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate - will buy in the other country. Whereas PPP estimates for
OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries
are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation
of numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program and by Professors
Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their
colleagues. Currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and
domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output.
In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of
GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore,
exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market
forces or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12
January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community
(whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies
by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real output of these countries
by half. One important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures
as a percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially
from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for
example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of Russian or
Japanese military expenditures. Note: The numbers for GDP and other economic
data can not be chained together from successive volumes of the Factbook because
of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical
agencies, use of new or different sources of information, and changes in national
statistical methods and practices. 
<P>
<B>Gross domestic product (GDP): </B>
 The value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in
a given year. 
<P>
<B>Gross national product (GNP): </B>
 The value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in
a given year, plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by foreigners
from domestic production. 
<P>
<B>Gross world product (GWP): </B>
 The aggregate value of all goods and services produced worldwide in
a given year. 
<P>
<B>Growth rate (population): </B>
 The annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus
(or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and
leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. 
<P>
<B>Illicit drugs: </B>
 There are five categories of illicit drugs - narcotics, stimulants,
depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include
many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally
produced and sold outside medical channels. 
  <BR>
 <I>Cannabis </I> (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which
provides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana
(pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol),
hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil). 
  <BR>
 <I>Coca </I> (Erythroxylum coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain
the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,
which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa
butter. 
  <BR>
 <I>Cocaine </I> is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca
bush. 
 Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and
include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),
benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden),
and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid). 
 Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional,
or behavioral change in an individual. 
 Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that
results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual. 

 Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness,
and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote
(mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine
(PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others
(psilocybin, psilocyn). 
  <BR>
 <I>Hashish </I> is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp
plant (Cannabis sativa). 
  <BR>
 <I>Heroin </I> is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine. 
  <BR>
 <I>Mandrax  </I>is the Southwest Asian slang term for methaqualone,
a pharmaceutical depressant. 
  <BR>
 <I>Marijuana </I> is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa). 
  <BR>
 <I>Methaqualone </I> is a pharmaceutical depressant, in slang referred
to as Quaaludes in North America or Mandrax in Southwest Asia 
 Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer
to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics
include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine
(Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine.
Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).
Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone
(Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil). 
  <BR>
 <I>Opium </I> is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod
of the opium poppy. 
 Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and
semisynthetic narcotics. 
 Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried
opium poppy. 
   <BR>
<I>Qat  </I>(kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves
of catha edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea. 
  <BR>
 <I>Quaaludes </I> is the North American slang term for methaqualone,
a pharmaceutical depressant. 
  <BR>
Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn,
Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others
(Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate). 
<P>
<B>Infant mortality rate: </B>
 The number of deaths to infants under one year old in a given year per
l,000 live births occurring in the same year. 
<P>
<B>International disputes: </B>
 This category includes a wide variety of situations that range from
traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or
another. Information regarding disputes over international boundaries and
maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the Department of State. References
to other situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such
as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues. However,
inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition
by the US Government. 
<P>
<B>Irrigated land: </B>
 The figure refers to the land area that is artificially supplied with
water. 
<P>
<B>Land use: </B>
 The land surface is categorized as arable land - land cultivated for
crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize, rice); permanent
crops - land cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each harvest
(citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures - land permanently used for
herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland - under dense or open stands
of trees; and other - any land type not specifically mentioned above (urban
areas, roads, desert). 
<P>
<B>Leaders: </B>
 The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who represents
the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not involved with the
day- to-day activities of the government. The head of government is the administrative
leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the government. In the UK,
the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime Minister is the head of government.
In the US, the President is both the chief of state and the head of government. 

<P>
<B>Life expectancy at birth: </B>
 The average number of years to be lived by a group of people all born
in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the future. 

<P>
<B>Literacy: </B>
 There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless
otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition - the ability
to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual
countries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope
of this publication. 
<P>
<B>Maritime claims: </B>
 The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims
from being extended the full distance. 
<P>
<B>Merchant marine: </B>
 All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial vessels (as
opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore
oil rigs, etc. Also, a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register. 

 <BR>
 <I>Captive register </I> - A register of ships maintained by a
territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships
owned in the parent country; also referred to as an offshore register, the
offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive register will
fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local variant of it, but will
be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory.
Although the nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for
ships owned in the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships
may also be owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register, except that it is not the register of an independent state. 
 <BR>
  <I>Flag of convenience register </I> - A national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags
of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue of low fees,
low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements.
True FOC registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships
registered actually owned in the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag
can be used for ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register
is one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also
referred to as an open register. 
 <BR>
  <I>Flag state </I> - The nation in which a ship is registered and
which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home
or abroad. Flag state maritime legislation determines how a ship is manned
and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register. 

  <BR>
 <I>Internal register </I> - A register of ships maintained as a
subset of a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime
rules from those on the main national register. These differences usually
include lower taxation of profits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually,
ownership outside the flag state (when it functions as an FOC register). The
Norwegian International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register
are the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental
in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting
foreign owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags. 
  <BR>
 <I>Merchant ship </I> - A vessel that carries goods against payment
of freight; commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted
to commercial vessels only. 
  <BR>
 <I>Register </I> - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality
as listed with the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium
of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it
with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which
registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate
owner. 
<P>
<B>Money figures:</B>
 All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless
otherwise indicated.
<P>
<B>National product: </B>
 The total output of goods and services in a country in a given year.
See GDP methodology, Gross domestic product (GDP), and Gross national product
(GNP). 
<P>
<B>Net migration rate: </B>
 The balance between the number of persons entering and leaving a country
during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess
of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000
population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (-9.26
migrants/1,000 population). 
<P>
<B>Population: </B>
 Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on statistics
from population censuses, vital statistics registration systems, or sample
surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future trends.
Starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries
(mostly African) have taken into account the effects of the growing incidence
of AIDS infections; in 1993 these countries were Burkina, Burundi, Central
African Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda,
Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Brazil, and Haiti. 
<P>
<B>Telephone numbers:</B>
 All telephone numbers presented in the Factbook consist of the country
code in brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, and
the local number. The one component that is not presented is the international
access code which varies from country to country. For example, an international
direct dial phone call placed from the United States to Madrid, Spain, would
be as follows: 
<UL>
<BR>
011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where 
<BR>
011 is the international access code for
station-to-station calls 
<BR>
(01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),
<BR>
[34] is the country code for Spain, 
<BR>
(1) is the city code for Madrid, 
<BR>
577 is the local exchange, 
<BR>
and xxxx is the local telephone number.
</UL>
An international direct dial phone call placed from another country
to the United States would be as follows: 
<P>
<UL>
international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx where 
<BR>
[1] is the country
code for the United States, 
<BR>
(202) is the area code for Washington, DC, 
<BR>
939 is the local exchange, 
<BR>
and xxxx is the local telephone number.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Total fertility rate:</B>
 The average number of children that would be born per woman if all women
lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to
a given fertility rate at each age. Years: All year references are for the
calendar year (CY) unless indicated as fiscal year (FY). FY93/94 refers to
the fiscal year that began in calendar year 1993 and ended in calendar year
1994 as defined in the Fiscal Year entry of the Economy section for each nation.
FY90-94 refers to the four fiscal years that began in calendar year 1990 and
ended in calendar year 1994.
