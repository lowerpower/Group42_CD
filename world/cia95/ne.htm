<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand. Government
 expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by  grants
from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public  employees.
The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence  gardening, although
some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists  primarily of small
factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and  coconut cream. The
sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an  important source of revenue.
The island in recent years has suffered a  serious loss of population because
of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.
