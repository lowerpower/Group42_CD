<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Niger is one of the world's poorest countries, with GDP growth lagging
 behind the rapid growth of population. The economy is centered on  subsistence
agriculture, animal husbandry, and reexport trade, and  increasingly less
on uranium, its major export throughout the 1970s and  1980s. Uranium revenues
dropped by almost 50% between 1983 and 1990 with  the end of the uranium boom.
Terms of trade with Nigeria, Niger's largest  regional trade partner, have
improved dramatically since the 50%  devaluation of the African franc in January
1994; this devaluation boosted  exports of livestock, peas, onions, and the
products of Niger's small  cotton industry. The government relies on bilateral
and multilateral aid  for operating expenses and public investment and is
strongly induced to  adhere to structural adjustment programs designed by
the IMF and the World  Bank.
