<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be hobbled by political
 instability and poor macroeconomic management. Nigeria's unpopular military
 rulers show no sign of wanting to restore democratic civilian rule in the
 near future and appear divided on how to redress fundamental economic  imbalances
that cause troublesome inflation and the steady depreciation of  the naira.
The government's domestic and international arrears continue to  limit economic
growth - even in the oil sector - and prevent an agreement  with the IMF and
bilateral creditors on debt relief. The inefficient  (largely subsistence)
agricultural sector has failed to keep up with rapid  population growth, and
Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now must  import food.
