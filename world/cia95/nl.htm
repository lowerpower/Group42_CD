<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private enterprise.
 The government makes its presence felt, however, through many regulations,
 permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting most aspects of  economic
activity. The trade and financial services sector contributes over  50% of
GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the  food-processing,
oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly  mechanized agricultural
sector employs only 4% of the labor force, but  provides large surpluses for
export and the domestic food-processing  industry. Indeed the Netherlands
ranks third worldwide in value of  agricultural exports, behind the US and
France. High unemployment and a  sizable budget deficit are currently the
most serious economic problems.  Many of the economic issues of the 1990s
will reflect the course of  European economic integration.
