<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free market activity
 and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as the
 vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state enterprises) and  extensively
subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and areas with sparse  resources. Norway
also maintains an extensive welfare system that helps  propel public sector
expenditures to slightly more than 50% of the GDP and  results in one of the
highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A  small country with a high
dependence on international trade, Norway is  basically an exporter of raw
materials and semiprocessed goods, with an  abundance of small- and medium-sized
firms, and is ranked among the major  shipping nations. The country is richly
endowed with natural resources -  petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and
minerals - and is highly  dependent on its oil sector to keep its economy
afloat. Norway imports more  than half its food needs. Although one of the
government's main priorities  is to reduce this dependency, this situation
is not likely to improve for  years to come. The government also hopes to
reduce unemployment and  strengthen and diversify the economy through tax
reform and a series of  expansionary budgets. The budget deficit is expected
to hit a record 8% of  GDP because of welfare spending and bail-outs of the
banking system.  Unemployment is currently running at 8.4% - including those
in job programs  - because of the weakness of the economy outside the oil
sector. Economic  growth, only 1.6% in 1993, moved up to 5.5% in 1994. Oslo
opted to stay out  of the EU during a referendum in November 1994.
