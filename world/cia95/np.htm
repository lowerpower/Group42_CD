<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
 Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over
 90% of the population and accounting for half of GDP. Industrial activity
 is limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute,
 sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has  expanded
recently and accounted for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in  FY93/94. Apart
from agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural  resources are mica,
hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production in the  late 1980s grew by
about 5%, as compared with annual population growth of  2.6%. More than 40%
of the population is undernourished. Since May 1991,  the government has been
encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by  eliminating business licenses
and registration requirements in order to  simplify domestic and foreign investment.
The government also has been  cutting public expenditures by reducing subsidies,
privatizing state  industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for
foreign trade and  investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of
the small size of  the economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness,
and  susceptibility to natural disaster. The international community provides
 funding for 70% of Nepal's developmental budget and for 30% of total  budgetary
expenditures. The government, realizing that attempts to reverse  three years
of liberalization would jeopardize this vital support, almost  certainly will
move ahead with its reform program in 1995-96.
