<h3>Economy</h3>

15% of  GDP and about 70% of export earnings. Paramaribo has failed to initiate
the  economic reforms necessary to stabilize the economy or win renewed Dutch

with monetary emissions. As a result, high inflation, high unemployment, 
widespread black market activity, and hard currency shortfalls continue to
 mark the economy.
