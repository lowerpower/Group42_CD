<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Since March 1991, when President CHAMORRO began an ambitious economic
 stabilization program, Nicaragua has had considerable success in reducing
 inflation and obtaining substantial economic aid from abroad. Annual  inflation
fell from more than 750% in 1991 to less than 5% in 1992.  Inflation rose
again to an estimated 20% in 1993, although this increase  was due almost
entirely to a large currency devaluation in January. As of  early 1994, the
government was close to finalizing an enhanced structural  adjustment facility
with the IMF, after the previous standby facility  expired in early 1993.
Despite these successes, achieving overall economic  growth in an economy
scarred by misguided economic values and civil war  during the 1980s has proved
elusive. Economic growth was flat in 1992 and  slightly negative in 1993.
Nicaragua's per capita foreign debt is one of  the highest in the world; nonetheless,
as of late 1993, Nicaragua was  current on its post-1988 debt as well as on
payments to the international  financial institutions. Definition of property
rights remains a problem;  ownership disputes over large tracts of land, businesses,
and homes  confiscated by the previous government have yet to be resolved.
A rise in  exports of coffee and other products led growth in 1994.
