<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy
 dependent on a guaranteed British market to a more industrialized, open 
free market economy that can compete on the global scene. The government 
has hoped that dynamic growth would boost real incomes, broaden and deepen
 the technological capabilities of the industrial sector, reduce  inflationary
pressures, and permit the expansion of welfare benefits. The  initial results
were mixed: inflation is down from double-digit levels, but  growth was sluggish
in 1988-91. In 1992-93, growth picked up to 3%  annually, a sign that the
new economic approach was beginning to pay off.  Business confidence strengthened
in 1994, and export demand picked up in  the Asia-Pacific region, resulting
in 6.2% growth. Inflation remains among  the lowest in the industrial world.
