<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP, employs
 about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports, in which
 soybeans and cotton are the most important. Paraguay lacks substantial  mineral
or petroleum resources but possesses a large hydropower potential.  In a major
step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay  in March 1991
joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which  includes Brazil,
Argentina, and Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through  an unorthodox approach,
reduced external debt with both commercial and  official creditors by purchasing
a sizable amount of the delinquent  commercial debt in the secondary market
at a substantial discount. The  government had paid 100% of remaining official
debt arrears to the US,  Germany, France, and Spain. All commercial debt arrears
have been  rescheduled. For the long run, the government must press forward
with  general, market-oriented economic reforms. Growth of 3.5% in 1993 was
 spurred by higher-than-expected agricultural output and rising  international
commodity prices. Inflation picked up steam in fourth quarter  1993 because
of rises in public sector salaries and utility rates. GDP  growth continued
in 1994 at 3.5%. Although inflation declined a bit over  1993, increases in
food prices, and crop and infrastructure damage from  heavy rains at the end
of the year, forced inflation to 18%, above the  government's target of 15%.
Paraguay reaffirmed its commitment to MERCOSUR  on 1 January 1995 by implementing
the organization's common external  tariff.
