<b>Names:</b> 
<br><i>conventional long form:</i> Republic of Peru  
<br><i>conventional short form:</i> Peru  
<br><i>local long form:</i> Republica del Peru  
<br><i>local short form:</i> Peru  

<p>
<b>Digraph:</b> PE 

<p>
<b>Type:</b> republic  

<p>
<b>Capital:</b> Lima  

<p>
<b>Administrative divisions:</b> 24 departments (departamentos, singular - departamento) and 1  constitutional
province* (provincia constitucional); Amazonas, Ancash,  Apurimac, Arequipa,
Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Callao*, Cusco, Huancavelica,  Huanuco, Ica, Junin, La
Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Loreto, Madre de Dios,  Moquegua, Pasco, Piura,
Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes, Ucayali 
<br><i>note:</i> the 1979 Constitution mandated the creation of regions (regiones, singular
 - region) to function eventually as autonomous economic and administrative
 entities; so far, 12 regions have been constituted from 23 of the 24  departments
- Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco,  Pasco, Junin),
Arequipa (from Arequipa), Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from  Tumbes, Piura),
Inca (from Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad  (from La Libertad),
Los Libertadores-Huari (from Ica, Ayacucho,  Huancavelica), Mariategui (from
Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del  Maranon (from Lambayeque, Cajamarca,
Amazonas), San Martin (from San  Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation
of another region has been  delayed by the reluctance of the constitutional
province of Callao to merge  with the department of Lima; because of inadequate
funding from the central  government and organizational and political difficulties,
the regions have  yet to assume major responsibilities; the 1993 Constitution
retains the  regions but limits their authority; the 1993 Constitution also
reaffirms  the roles of departmental and municipal governments.

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Peruvian economy has become increasingly market-oriented, with
major  privatizations completed in 1994 in the mining and telecommunications
 industries. In the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation,  declining
per capita output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off  from IMF
and World Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt  arrears.
An austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI  government took
office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive  yearly contraction
of economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late  that year, and in
1991 output rose 2.4%. After a burst of inflation as the  austerity program
eliminated government price subsidies, monthly price  increases eased to the
single-digit level and by December 1991 dropped to  the lowest increase since
mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue  package from multilateral lenders
in September 1991, although it faced $14  billion in arrears on its external
debt. By working with the IMF and World  Bank on new financial conditions
and arrangements, the government succeeded  in ending its arrears by March
1993. In 1992, GDP had fallen by 2.8%, in  part because a warmer-than-usual
El Nino current resulted in a 30% drop in  the fish catch, but the economy
rebounded as strong foreign investment  helped push growth to 6% in 1993 and
8.6% in 1994.
