<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Pakistani economy has made progress in several key areas since
Benazir  BHUTTO became Prime Minister in October 1993. She has been under
pressure  from international donors and the IMF - which gave Pakistan a $1.3
billion  structural adjustment credit in February 1994 - to continue the economic
 reforms and austerity measures begun by her predecessor, caretaker Prime
 Minister Moeen QURESHI (July-October 1993). Foreign exchange reserves  climbed
to more than $3 billion in 1994, and the budget deficit was  substantially
reduced. Real GDP growth was 4% in FY93/94, up from 2.3% in  FY92/93. Foreign
direct and portfolio investment also have increased.  Privatization of large
public sector utilities began in 1994 with the sale  of 12% of the Pakistan
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and the Water  and Power Development
Authority (WAPDA); the sale of state-owned banks and  other large units are
planned for 1995. Still, the government must cope  with long-standing economic
vulnerabilities - high levels of debt service  and defense spending, a small
tax base, a huge population, and dependence  on cotton-based exports - which
hamper its ability to create a stable  economic environment. In addition,
Pakistan's infrastructure is inadequate  and deteriorating, low levels of
literacy constrain industrial growth, and  increasing sectarian, ethnic, and
tribal violence disrupt production.
