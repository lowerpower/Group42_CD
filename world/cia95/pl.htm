<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Poland continues to make good progress in the difficult transition
to a  market economy that began on 1 January 1990, when the new democratic
 government instituted "shock therapy" by decontrolling prices, slashing 
subsidies, and drastically reducing import barriers. Real GDP fell sharply
 in 1990 and 1991, but in 1992 Poland became the first country in the region
 to resume economic growth with a 2.6% increase. Growth increased to 3.8%
in  1993 and 5.5% in 1994 - the highest rate in Europe except for Albania.
All  of the growth since 1991 has come from the booming private sector, which
 now accounts for at least 55% of GDP, even though privatization of the  state-owned
enterprises is proceeding slowly and most industry remains in  state hands.
Industrial production increased 12% in 1994 - led by 50% jumps  in the output
of motor vehicles, radios and televisions, and pulp and paper  - and is now
well above the 1990 level. Inflation, which had approached  1,200% annually
in early 1990, was down to about 30% in 1994, as the  government held the
budget deficit to 1.5% of GDP. After five years of  steady increases, unemployment
has leveled off at about 16% nationwide,  although it approaches 30% in some
regions. The trade deficit was sharply  reduced in 1994, due mainly to increased
exports to Western Europe,  Poland's main customer. The leftist government
elected in September 1993  gets generally good marks from foreign observers
for its management of the  budget but is often criticized for not moving faster
on privatization.
