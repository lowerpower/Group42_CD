<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Because of its key geographic location, Panama's economy is service-based,
 heavily weighted toward banking, commerce, and tourism. Trade and financial
 ties with the US are especially close. GDP grew at 3.6% in 1994, a  respectable
rate, yet below the 7.1% average of the early 1990s. Banking  and financial
services and trade through the Colon Free Zone continued to  expand rapidly,
with the industrial and agricultural sectors experiencing  little growth.
The new administration, inaugurated 1 September 1994, has  launched an economic
plan designed to reverse rising unemployment, attract  foreign investment,
cut back the size of government, and modernize the  economy. The success of
the plan in meeting its goals for 1995 and beyond  depends largely on the
success of the administration in reforming the labor  code and instituting
the reforms necessary to join the GATT.
