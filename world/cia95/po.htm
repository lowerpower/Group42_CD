<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Portugal's economy contracted 0.4% in 1993 but registered a 1.4% growth
in  1994, with 3% growth expected in 1995 and 1996. This comeback rests on
high  levels of public investment, continuing strong export growth, and a
gradual  recovery in consumer spending. The government's long-run economic
goal is  the modernization of Portuguese markets, industry, infrastructure,
and work  force in order to catch up with productivity and income levels of
the more  advanced EU countries. Per capita income now equals only 55% of
the EU  average. Economic policy in 1994 focused on reducing inflationary
pressures  by lowering the fiscal deficit, maintaining a stable escudo, moderating
 wage increases, and encouraging increased competition. The government's 
medium-term objective is to be in the first tier of the EU countries  eligible
to join the economic and monetary union (EMU) as early as 1997. To  this end,
the 1995 budget posits a cut in total deficit to 5.8% of GDP.
