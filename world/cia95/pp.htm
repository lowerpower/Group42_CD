<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation
 has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing an
 infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of
 the population. Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and gold, 
accounts for about 60% of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia
 and development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the  economy.
Robust growth in 1991-92 was led by the mining sector; the opening  of a large
new gold mine helped the advance. At the start of 1995, Port  Moresby is looking
primarily to the exploitation of mineral and petroleum  resources to drive
economic development but new prospecting in Papua New  Guinea has slumped
as other mineral-rich countries have stepped up their  competition for international
investment. Output from current projects will  probably begin to taper off
in 1996, but no new large ventures are being  developed to succeed them.
