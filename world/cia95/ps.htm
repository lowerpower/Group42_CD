<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy consists primarily of subsistence agriculture and fishing.
The  government is the major employer of the work force, relying heavily on
 financial assistance from the US. The compact of "free association" with
 the United States, entered into after the end of the UN trusteeship on 1
 October 1994, provides Palau with $500 million in US aid over 15 years in
 return for furnishing some military facilities. The population, in effect,
 enjoys a per capita income of $5,000, twice that of the Philippines and 
much of Micronesia. Long-run prospects for the tourist sector have been  greatly
bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific and the  rapidly rising
prosperity of leading East Asian countries.
