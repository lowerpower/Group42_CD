<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane
has been  the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts
for  85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a
 tourist industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to
 one-third of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and
 the poor is extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions.
 The white and Indian communities are substantially better off than other
 segments of the population, often approaching European standards, whereas
 indigenous groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer
 nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in  February
1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The  economic
well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial  assistance from
France.
