<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Despite the continuing difficulties in moving away from the former
command  system, the Romanian economy seems to have bottomed out in 1993-94.
Market  oriented reforms have been introduced fitfully since the downfall
of  CEAUSESCU in December 1989, with the result a growing private sector,
 especially in services. The slow pace of structural reform, however, has
 exacerbated Romania's high inflation rate and eroded real wages.  Agricultural
production rebounded in 1993 from the drought-reduced harvest  of 1992. The
economy continued its recovery in 1994, further gains being  realized in agriculture,
construction, services, and trade. Food supplies  are adequate but expensive.
Romania's infrastructure had deteriorated over  the last five years due to
reduced levels of public investment. Residents  of the capital reported frequent
disruptions of heating and water services.  The slow and painful process of
conversion to a more open economy will  continue in 1995.
