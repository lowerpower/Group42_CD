<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean
region.  Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of economic
 activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US and by tax
 incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s.
 US minimum wage laws apply. Important industries include pharmaceuticals,
 electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar  production
has lost out to dairy production and other livestock products as  the main
source of income in the agricultural sector. Tourism has  traditionally been
an important source of income for the island, with  estimated arrivals of
nearly 3.9 million tourists in 1993.
