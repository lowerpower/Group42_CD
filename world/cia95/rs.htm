<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural resources, a well-educated
 population, and a diverse industrial base, continues to experience  formidable
difficulties in moving from its old centrally planned economy to  a modern
market economy. President YEL'TSIN's government has made  substantial strides
in converting to a market economy since launching its  economic reform program
in January 1992 by freeing nearly all prices,  slashing defense spending,
eliminating the old centralized distribution  system, completing an ambitious
voucher privatization program, establishing  private financial institutions,
and decentralizing foreign trade. Russia,  however, has made little progress
in a number of key areas that are needed  to provide a solid foundation for
the transition to a market economy.  Financial stabilization has remained
elusive, with wide swings in monthly  inflation rates. Only limited restructuring
of industry has occurred so far  because of a scarcity of investment funds
and the failure of enterprise  managers to make hard cost-cutting decisions.
In addition, Moscow has yet  to develop a social safety net that would allow
faster restructuring by  relieving enterprises of the burden of providing
social benefits for their  workers and has been slow to develop the legal
framework necessary to fully  support a market economy and to encourage foreign
investment. As a result,  output has continued to fall. According to Russian
official data, which  probably overstate the fall, GDP declined by 15% in
1994 compared with a  12% decline in 1993. Industrial output in 1994 fell
21% with all major  sectors taking a hit. Agricultural production in 1994
was down 9%. The  grain harvest totaled 81 million tons, some 15 million tons
less than in  1993. Unemployment climbed to an estimated 6.6 million or about
7% of the  work force by yearend 1994. Floundering Russian firms have already
had to  put another 4.8 million workers on involuntary, unpaid leave or shortened
 workweeks. Government fears of large-scale unemployment continued to hamper
 industrial restructuring efforts. According to official Russian data, real
 per capita income was up nearly 18% in 1994 compared with 1993, in part 
because many Russians are working second jobs. Most Russians perceive that
 they are worse off now because of growing crime and health problems and 
mounting wage arrears. Russia has made significant headway in privatizing
 state assets, completing its voucher privatization program at midyear 1994.
 At least a portion of about 110,000 state enterprises were transferred to
 private hands by the end of 1994. Including partially privatized firms, the
 private sector accounted for roughly half of GDP in 1994. Financial  stabilization
continued to remain a challenge for the government. Moscow  tightened financial
policies in late 1993 and early 1994, including  postponing planned budget
spending, and succeeded in reducing monthly  inflation from 18% in January
to about 5% in July and August. At midyear,  however, the government relaxed
austerity measures in the face of mounting  pressure from industry and agriculture,
sparking a new round of inflation;  the monthly inflation rate jumped to roughly
15% per month during the  fourth quarter. In response, Moscow announced a
fairly tight government  budget for 1995 designed to bring monthly inflation
down to around 1% by  the end of 1995. According to official statistics, Russia's
1994 trade with  nations outside the former Soviet Union produced a $12.3
billion surplus,  up from $11.3 billion in 1993. Foreign sales - comprised
largely of oil,  natural gas, and other raw materials - grew more than 8%.
Imports also were  up 8% as demand for food and other consumer goods surged.
Russian trade  with other former Soviet republics continued to decline. At
the same time,  Russia paid only a fraction of the roughly $20 billion in
debt that came  due in 1994, and by the end of the year, Russia's hard currency
foreign  debt had risen to nearly $100 billion. Moscow reached agreement to
 restructure debts with Paris Club official creditors in mid-1994 and  concluded
a preliminary deal with its commercial bank creditors late in the  year to
reschedule debts owed them in early 1995. Capital flight continued  to be
a serious problem in 1994, with billions of additional dollars in  assets
being moved abroad, primarily to bank accounts in Europe. Russia's  physical
plant continues to deteriorate because of insufficient maintenance  and new
construction. Plant and equipment on average are twice the age of  the West's.
Many years will pass before Russia can take full advantage of  its natural
resources and its human assets.

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>
<b>Telephone system:</b> 24,400,000 telephones; 20,900,000 telephones in urban areas and 3,500,000
 telephones in rural areas; of these, total installed in homes 15,400,000;
 total pay phones for long distant calls 34,100; about 164 telephones/1,000
 persons; Russia is enlisting foreign help, by means of joint ventures, to
 speed up the modernization of its telecommunications system; in 1992, only
 661,000 new telephones were installed compared with 855,000 in 1991, and
in  1992 the number of unsatisfied applications for telephones reached  11,000,000;
expanded access to international E-mail service available via  Sprint network;
the inadequacy of Russian telecommunications is a severe  handicap to the
economy, especially with respect to international  connections 
<br><i>local:</i> NMT-450 analog cellular telephone networks are operational and growing
in  Moscow and St. Petersburg 
<br><i>intercity:</i> intercity fiberoptic cable installation remains limited 
<br><i>international:</i> international traffic is handled by an inadequate system of satellites,
 land lines, microwave radio relay and outdated submarine cables; this  traffic
passes through the international gateway switch in Moscow which  carries most
of the international traffic for the other countries of the  Commonwealth
of Independent States; a new Russian Raduga satellite will  link Moscow and
St. Petersburg with Rome from whence calls will be relayed  to destinations
in Europe and overseas; satellite earth stations -  INTELSAT, Intersputnik,
Eutelsat (Moscow), INMARSAT, Orbita

<b>Radio:</b>

 diffusion 74,300,000)

<h3>Defense Forces</h3>

<p>
<b>Branches:</b> Ground Forces, Navy, Air Forces, Air Defense Forces, Strategic Rocket
 Forces  

<p>
<b>Manpower availability:</b> males age 15-49 38,264,699; males fit for military service 29,951,977;
 males reach military age (18) annually 1,106,176 (1995 est.) 

<p>
<b>Defense expenditures:</b> $NA, NA% of GDP 
<br><i>note:</i> the Intelligence Community estimates that defense spending in Russia
fell  about 15% in real terms in 1994, reducing Russian defense outlays to
about  one-fourth of peak Soviet levels in the late 1980s; although Russia
may  still spend as much as 10% of its GDP on defense, this is significantly
 below the 15% to 17% burden the former USSR carried during much of the  1980s;
conversion of military expenditures into US dollars using the  current exchange
rate could produce misleading results
