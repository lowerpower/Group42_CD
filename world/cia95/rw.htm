<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Rwanda is a poor African nation suffering bitterly from ethnic-based
civil  war. Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and
tea  make up 80%-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited,
 however, and deforestation and soil erosion continue to create problems.
 The industrial sector in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. 
Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of agricultural products. 
The Rwandan economy remains dependent on coffee/tea exports and foreign  aid.
Weak international prices since 1986 have caused the economy to  contract
and per capita GDP to decline. A structural adjustment program  with the World
Bank began in October 1990. Ethnic-based insurgency since  1990 has devastated
wide areas, especially in the north, and displaced  hundreds of thousands
of people. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily  ended most of the fighting,
but massive resumption of civil warfare in  April 1994 in the capital city
Kigali and elsewhere has been taking  thousands of lives and severely affecting
short-term economic prospects.  The economy suffers massively from failure
to maintain the infrastructure,  looting, neglect of important cash crops,
and lack of health care  facilities.
