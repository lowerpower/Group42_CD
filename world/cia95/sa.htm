<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> This is a well-to-do oil-based economy with strong government controls
over  major economic activities. About 46% of GDP comes from the private sector.
 Economic (as well as political) ties with the US are especially strong. The
 petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP,
 and almost all export earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of
 petroleum in the world (26% of the proved total), ranks as the largest  exporter
of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the  government
intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit since  1983, back into
balance, and to encourage private economic activity.  Roughly four million
foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi  economy, for example,
in the oil and banking sectors. For about a decade,  Saudi Arabia's domestic
and international outlays have outstripped its  income, and the government
has cut its foreign assistance and is beginning  to rein in domestic programs.
For 1995, the country looks for improvement  in oil prices and will continue
its policies of restraining public spending  and encouraging non-oil exports.
