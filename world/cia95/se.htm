<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Since independence in 1976, per capita output has grown to roughly
seven  times the old near-subsistence level, led by the tourist sector, which
 employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard 
currency earnings. In recent years the government has encouraged foreign 
investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time,
 the government has moved to reduce the high dependence on tourism by  promoting
the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale  manufacturing. The vulnerability
of the tourist sector was illustrated by  the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely
to the Gulf war. Although the  industry has rebounded, the government recognizes
the continuing need for  upgrading the sector in the face of stiff international
competition.
