<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy
 incomes, material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to
 those of Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population  suffers
from the poverty patterns of the Third World, including  unemployment and
lack of job skills. The main strength of the economy lies  in its rich mineral
resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.  Economic developments for
the remainder of the 1990s will be driven largely  by the new government's
attempts to improve black living conditions, to set  the country on an aggressive
export-led growth path, and to cut back the  enormous numbers of unemployed.
The economy in recent years has absorbed  less than 5% of the more than 300,000
workers entering the labor force  annually. Local economists estimate that
the economy must grow between 5%  and 6% in real terms annually to absorb
all of the new entrants, much less  reduce the accumulated total.
