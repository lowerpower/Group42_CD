<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> In 1994 Senegal embarked on its most concerted structural adjustment
effort  yet to exploit the 50% devaluation of the currencies of the 14 Francophone
 African nations on 12 January. After years of foot-dragging, the government
 finally passed a liberalized labor code which should significantly help 
lower the cost of labor and improve the manufacturing sector's  competitiveness.
Inroads also have been made in closing tax loopholes and  eliminating monopoly
power in several sectors. At the same time the  government is holding the
line on current fiscal expenditure under the  watchful eyes of international
organizations on which it depends for  substantial support. A bumper peanut
crop - Senegal's main source of  foreign exchange - coincided with an improvement
of international prices  and probably resulted in a doubling of earnings in
1994 over 1993. The  country's narrow resource base, environmental degradation,
and untamed  population growth will continue to hold back growth in living
standards  over the medium term.
