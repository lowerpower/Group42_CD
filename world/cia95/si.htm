<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Slovenia appears to be making a solid economic recovery, fulfilling
the  promise it showed at the time of Yugoslavia's breakup. It was by far
the  most prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics, with a per capita income
 more than twice the national average. It also benefited from strong ties
to  Western Europe and suffered comparatively small physical damage in the
 dismemberment process. The beginning was difficult, however. Real GDP fell
 15% during 1991-92, while inflation jumped to 247% in 1991 and unemployment
 topped 8% - nearly three times the 1989 level. The turning point came in
 1993 when real GDP grew 1%, unemployment leveled off at about 9%, and  inflation
slowed dramatically to 23%. In 1994, the rate of growth of GDP  rose to 4%,
unemployment remained stable, and inflation dropped to 20%.  This was accomplished,
moreover, without balance-of-payments problems. The  government gets generally
good economic marks from foreign observers,  particularly with regard to fiscal
policy - the budget deficit in 1994 was  only about 1% of GDP, following several
years of small surpluses. Prospects  for 1995 appear good, with economic growth
expected to remain strong while  unemployment and inflation may decline slightly.
Privatization, sluggish to  date, is expected to pick up in 1995.
