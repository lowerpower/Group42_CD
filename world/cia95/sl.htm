<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Sierra Leone has substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources,
 but the economic and social infrastructure is not well developed.  Agriculture
generates about 40% of GDP and employs about two-thirds of the  working population,
with subsistence agriculture dominating the sector.  Manufacturing, which
accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of  the processing of raw
materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic  market. Diamond mining
provides an important source of hard currency. Since  1990, the government
has been able to meet its IMF- and World Bank-mandated  stabilization targets,
holding down fiscal deficits, increasing foreign  exchange reserves, and retiring
much of its domestic debt - but at a steep  cost in terms of capital investments
and social spending. Moreover, the  economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed
due to neglect and war-related  disruptions in the mining and agricultural
export sectors. The continuing  civil war in Liberia has led to a large influx
of refugees, who place  additional burdens on Sierra Leon's fragile economy.
