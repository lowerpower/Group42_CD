<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong service and
 manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links derived 
from its entrepot history. The economy registered 10.1% growth in 1994,  with
prospects for 7.5%-8.5% growth in 1995. In 1994, the manufacturing and  financial
and business services sectors have led economic growth. Exports  boomed, led
by the electronics sector, particularly US demand for disk  drives. Rising
labor costs continue to be a threat to Singapore's  competitiveness, but there
are indications that productivity is keeping up.  In applied technology, per
capita output, investment, and labor discipline,  Singapore has key attributes
of a developed country.
