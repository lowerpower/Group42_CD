<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> One of the world's poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has
few  resources. Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated by the civil
 war. Agriculture is the most important sector, with livestock accounting
 for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and  seminomads
who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood make up  about 70% of
the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and  employs about
20% of the work force. The main export crop is bananas;  sugar, sorghum, and
corn are grown for the domestic market. The small  industrial sector is based
on the processing of agricultural products and  accounts for less than 10%
of GDP; most facilities have been shut down  because of the civil strife.
The greatly increased political turmoil of  1991-93 has resulted in a substantial
drop in agricultural output, with  widespread famine. In 1994 economic conditions
stabilized in the  countryside but may turn worse in 1995 if civil strife
intensifies after  the UN withdrawal.
