<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Spain, with a per capita output approximately two-thirds that of the
four  leading economies of Western Europe, has shared with these countries
the  recession of the early 1990s and the upturn of their economic fortunes
in  1994. But whereas unemployment in these countries has hovered just above
 10%, Spain has been forced to cope with a 25% unemployment rate. Continued
 political turmoil has complicated the establishment of stable government
 policies toward budgetary restraint, interest rates, labor law reform, and
 Spain's role in the evolving economic integration of Western Europe.  Because
the recession has been so deep, the growth in industrial output,  tourism,
and other sectors in 1994, while welcome, falls far short of the  growth required
to bring unemployment down to, say, 10%. The recovery in  the economies of
major trade partners, the comparatively low inflation  rate, lower interest
rates, and prospects in the tourist sector suggest  that Spain can make substantial
progress in 1995.
