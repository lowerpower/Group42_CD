of the successor republics represents its  continuation </i>

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in 1991 has been followed
by  bloody ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and
the  breakup of important interrepublic trade flows. Serbia and Montenegro
faces  major economic problems; output has dropped sharply, particularly in
1993.  First, like the other former Yugoslav republics, it depended on its
sister  republics for large amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and  manufactures.
Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and levels of  technology
among the republics accentuated this interdependence, as did the  communist
practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small  number of giant
plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp  drop in output
as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets, and the  destruction of physical
assets in the fighting all have contributed to the  economic difficulties
of the republics. One singular factor in the economic  situation of Serbia
and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a  communist government that
is primarily interested in political and military  mastery, not economic reform.
A further complication is the imposition of  economic sanctions by the UN
in 1992. Hyperinflation ended with the  establishment of a new currency unit
in June 1993; prices were relatively  stable in 1994. Reliable statistics
are hard to come by; the GDP estimate  of $1,000 per capita in 1994 is extremely
rough. Output in 1994 seems to  have leveled off after the plunge in 1993.

 growing season; produces fruit, grapes, and cereals; in this area,  livestock
production (sheep and cattle) and dairy farming prosper; Kosovo  produces
fruits, vegetables, tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; the  mountainous
pastures of Kosovo and Montenegro support sheep and goat  husbandry; Montenegro
has only a small agriculture sector, mostly near the  coast where a Mediterranean
climate permits the culture of olives, citrus,  grapes, and rice
