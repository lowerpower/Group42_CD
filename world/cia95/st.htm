<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Though foreign investment in manufacturing and information processing
in  recent years has increased Saint Lucia's industrial base, the economy
 remains vulnerable due to its heavy dependence on banana production, which
 is subject to periodic droughts and tropical storms. Indeed, the  destructive
effect of Tropical Storm Debbie in mid-1994 caused the loss of  60% of the
year's banana crop. Increased competition from Latin American  bananas will
probably further reduce market prices, exacerbating Saint  Lucia's need to
diversify its economy in coming years, e.g., by expanding  tourism, manufacturing,
and construction
