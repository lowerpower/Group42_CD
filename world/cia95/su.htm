<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
 weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances from abroad, and  counterproductive
economic policies. Governmental entities account for more  than 70% of new
investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are  agriculture and
trading, with most private industrial investment predating  1980. Agriculture
employs 80% of the work force. Industry mainly processes  agricultural items.
Sluggish economic performance over the past decade,  attributable largely
to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of  per capita income and
consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages  continue to cause difficulties.
In 1990 the International Monetary Fund  took the unusual step of declaring
Sudan noncooperative because of its  nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund.
After Sudan backtracked on promised  reforms in 1992-93, the IMF threatened
to expel Sudan from the Fund. To  avoid expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make
payments on its arrears to the  Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce
subsidies. These measures have  been partially implemented. The government's
continued prosecution of the  civil war and its growing international isolation
led to a further  deterioration of the nonagricultural sectors of the economy
during 1994.  Agriculture, on the other hand, after several disappointing
years, enjoyed  a bumper fall harvest in 1994; its strong performance produced
an overall  growth rate in GDP of perhaps 7%.
