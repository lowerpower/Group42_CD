<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By treaty (9
 February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights to 
exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK,
 Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only  companies
still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on  Svalbard are essentially
company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal  company employs nearly 60%
of the Norwegian population on the island, runs  many of the local services,
and provides most of the local infrastructure.  There is also some trapping
of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.
