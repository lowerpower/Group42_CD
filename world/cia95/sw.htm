<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through
 World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
 mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. It has
 a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external  communications,
and a skilled labor force. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore  constitute the
resource base of an economy that is heavily oriented toward  foreign trade.
Privately owned firms account for about 90% of industrial  output, of which
the engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and  exports. In 1990, agriculture
accounted for only 1.2% of GDP and 1.9% of  the jobs, Sweden being about 50%
sufficient in most products. In the last  few years, however, this extraordinarily
favorable picture has been clouded  by inflation, growing unemployment, and
a gradual loss of competitiveness  in international markets. Although Prime
Minister BILDT's center-right  minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead
with free-market-oriented  reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - about
14% of GDP in FY93/94  projections - and record unemployment have forestalled
many of the plans.  Unemployment in 1994 is estimated at around 9% with another
5% in job  training. Continued heavy foreign exchange speculation forced the
 government to cooperate in late 1992 with the opposition Social Democrats
 on two crisis packages - one a severe austerity pact and the other a  program
to spur industrial competitiveness - which basically set economic  policy
through 1997. In November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's  ECU, and
the krona has since depreciated about 25% against the dollar. The  boost in
export competitiveness from the depreciation helped lift Sweden  out of its
3-year recession. To curb the budget deficit and bolster  confidence in the
economy, the new Social Democratic government is  proposing cuts in welfare
benefits, subsidies, defense, and foreign aid.  Sweden has harmonized its
economic policies with those of the EU, which it  joined at the start of 1995.
