<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> In 1990-93 Syria's state-dominated Ba'thist economy benefited from
the Gulf  war, increased oil production, good weather, and economic deregulation.
 Economic growth averaged roughly 10%. The Gulf war provided Syria an aid
 windfall of nearly $5 billion dollars from Arab, European, and Japanese 
donors. However, the benefits of the 1990-93 boom were not evenly  distributed
and the gap between rich and poor is widening. A nationwide  financial scandal
and increasing inflation were accompanied by a decline in  GDP growth to 4%
in 1994. For the long run, Syria's economy is still  saddled with a large
number of poorly performing public sector firms, and  industrial productivity
remains to be improved. Oil production is likely to  fall off dramatically
by the end of the decade. Unemployment will become a  problem for the government
when the more than 60% of the population under  the age of 20 enter the labor
force.
