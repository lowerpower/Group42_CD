<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Switzerland's economy - one of the most prosperous and stable in the
world  - is nonetheless undergoing a stressful adjustment after both the 
inflationary boom of the late 1980s and the electorate's rejection of  membership
in the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1992. So far the decision  to remain
outside the European single market structure does not appear to  have harmed
Swiss interests. In December 1994, the Swiss began bilateral  negotiations
with the EU aimed at establishing closer ties in areas of  mutual interest
and progressing toward the free circulation of persons,  goods, capital, and
services between the two parties. The Swiss emerged  from a three-year recession
in mid-1993 and posted 1.8% GDP growth in 1994.  The Swiss central bank's
tight monetary policies brought inflation down  from about 4% in 1992 to just
under 1% in 1994. Unemployment has fallen  slightly from 5.1% in 1993 to 4.7%
in 1994. Swiss per capita output, living  standards, education, and health
care remain unsurpassed in Europe. The  country has few mineral resources,
but its spectacular natural beauty  sustains a substantial tourism industry.
