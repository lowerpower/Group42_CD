<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's highest incomes
per  capita and with a sizable annual trade surplus. Its wealth is based on
oil  and gas output (about 40% of GDP), and the fortunes of the economy  fluctuate
with the prices of those commodities. Since 1973, the UAE has  undergone a
profound transformation from an impoverished region of small  desert principalities
to a modern state with a high standard of living. At  present levels of production,
crude oil reserves should last for over 100  years. Although much stronger
economically than most Gulf states, the UAE  faces similar problems with weak
international oil prices and the pressures  for cuts in OPEC oil production
quotas. The UAE government is encouraging  increased privatization within
the economy.
