<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Thailand's economy recovered rapidly from the political unrest in May
1992  to post an impressive 7.5% growth rate for the year, 7.8% in 1993, and
8%  in 1994. One of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, Thailand
 depends on exports of manufactures and the development of the service  sector
to fuel the country's rapid growth. Much of Thailand's recent  imports have
been for capital equipment, suggesting that the export sector  is poised for
further growth. With foreign investment slowing, Bangkok is  working to increase
the generation of domestic capital. Prime Minister  CHUAN's government - Thailand's
fifth government in less than three years -  is pledged to continue Bangkok's
probusiness policies, and the return of a  democratically elected government
has improved business confidence. Even  so, CHUAN must overcome divisions
within his ruling coalition to complete  much needed infrastructure development
programs if Thailand is to remain an  attractive place for business investment.
Over the longer-term, Bangkok  must produce more college graduates with technical
training and upgrade  workers' skills to continue its rapid economic development.
