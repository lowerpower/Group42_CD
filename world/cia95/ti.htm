<p> <a href="index.htm">Tajikistan </a></h1>
<p><i>Note--Tajikistan has experienced
three changes of government since it gained  independence in September 1991.
The current president, Emomali RAKHMONOV,  was elected to the presidency in
November 1994, yet has been in power since  1992. The country is suffering
through its third year of a civil war, with  no clear end in sight. Underlying
the conflict are deeply-rooted regional  and clan-based animosities that pit
a government consisting of people  primarily from the Kulob (Kulyab), Khujand
(Leninabad), and Hisor (Hissar)  regions against a secular and Islamic-led
opposition from the Gharm,  Gorno-Badakhshan, and Qurghonteppa (Kurgan-Tyube)
regions. Government and  opposition representatives have held periodic rounds
of UN-mediated peace  talks and agreed in September 1994 to a cease-fire.
Russian-led  peacekeeping troops are deployed throughout the country, and
Russian border  guards are stationed along the Tajik-Afghan border. </i>

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Tajikistan had the next-to-lowest per capita GDP in the former USSR,
the  highest rate of population growth, and an extremely low standard of living.
 Agriculture dominates the economy, cotton being the most important crop.
 Mineral resources, varied but limited in amount, include silver, gold,  uranium,
and tungsten. Industry is limited to a large aluminum plant,  hydropower facilities,
and small obsolete factories mostly in light  industry and food processing.
The Tajik economy has been gravely weakened  by three years of civil war and
by the loss of subsidies and markets for  its products, which has left Tajikistan
dependent on Russia and Uzbekistan  and on international humanitarian assistance
for much of its basic  subsistence needs. Moreover, constant political turmoil
and the continued  dominance by former Communist officials have impeded the
introduction of  meaningful economic reforms. In the meantime, Tajikistan's
efforts to adopt  the Russian ruble as its domestic currency despite Russia's
unwillingness  to supply sufficient rubles left the country in a severe monetary
crisis  throughout 1994, keeping inflation low but leaving workers and pensioners
 unpaid for months at a time. The government has announced plans to  introduce
its own currency in 1995 to help resolve the problem.
