<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy's base is agriculture, which employs about 70% of the labor
 force and contributes 40% to GDP. Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla
 beans are the main crops, and agricultural exports make up two-thirds of
 total exports. The country must import a high proportion of its food,  mainly
from New Zealand. The manufacturing sector accounts for only 11% of  GDP.
Tourism is the primary source of hard currency earnings, but the  country
also remains dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to  offset
its trade deficit. The economy continued to grow in 1993-94 largely  because
of a rise in squash exports, increased aid flows, and several large  construction
projects. The government is now turning its attention to  further development
of the private sector and the reduction of the budget  deficit.
