<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which
accounts  for about half of GDP and provides employment for 80% of the labor
force.  Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which
together  generate about 30% of total export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient
in  basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector  phosphate
mining is by far the most important activity, although it has  suffered from
the collapse of world phosphate prices and increased foreign  competition.
Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The  government's decade-long
IMF and World Bank supported effort to implement  economic reform measures
to encourage foreign investment and bring revenues  in line with expenditures
has stalled. Political unrest, including private  and public sector strikes
throughout 1992 and 1993, has jeopardized the  reform program, shrunk the
tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity.  Although strikes had ended
in 1994, political unrest and lack of funds  prevented the government from
taking advantage of the 50% currency  devaluation of January 1994. Resumption
of World Bank and IMF flows will  depend on implementation of several controversial
moves toward  privatization and on downsizing the military, on which the regime
depends  to stay in power.
