<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> This small poor island economy has remained dependent on cocoa since
 independence 20 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa production has  gradually
declined because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987  annual output
had fallen from 10,000 tons to 3,900 tons. As a result, a  shortage of cocoa
for export has created a serious balance-of-payments  problem. Production
of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and  palm kernels, has also
declined. The value of imports generally exceeds  that of exports by a ratio
of 4:1 or more. The emphasis on cocoa production  at the expense of other
food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import  90% of food needs. It also
has to import all fuels and most manufactured  goods. Over the years, Sao
Tome has been unable to service its external  debt and has had to depend on
concessional aid and debt rescheduling.  Considerable potential exists for
development of a tourist industry, and  the government has taken steps to
expand facilities in recent years. The  government also has attempted to reduce
price controls and subsidies and to  encourage market-based mechanisms, e.
g., to facilitate the distribution of  imported food. Annual GDP growth is
estimated in the 3%-4% range for  1994-96.
