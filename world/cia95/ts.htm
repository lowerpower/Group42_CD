<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural, mining,
energy,  tourism, and manufacturing sectors. Detailed governmental control
of  economic affairs has gradually lessened over the past decade, including
 increasing privatization of trade and commerce, simplification of the tax
 structure, and a cautious approach to debt. Real growth has averaged  roughly
5% in 1991-94, and inflation has been moderate. Growth in tourism  and IMF
support have been key elements in this solid record. Further  privatization
and further improvements in government administrative  efficiency are among
the challenges for the future.
