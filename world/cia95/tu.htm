<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> In early 1995, after an impressive economic performance through most
of the  1980s, Turkey continues to suffer through its most damaging economic
crisis  in the last 15 years. Sparked by the downgrading in January 1994 of
 Turkey's international credit rating by two US credit rating agencies, the
 crisis stems from years of loose fiscal and monetary policies that had  exacerbated
inflation and allowed the public debt, money supply, and  current account
deficit to explode. In April 1994, Prime Minister CILLER  introduced an austerity
package aimed at restoring domestic and  international confidence in her fragile
coalition government. Three months  later the IMF endorsed the program, paving
the way for a $740 million IMF  standby loan. Although the economy showed
signs of improvement following  the stabilization measures, CILLER has been
unable to overcome the  political obstacles to tough structural reforms necessary
for sustained,  longer-term growth. As a consequence, the economy is suffering
the worst of  both worlds: at the end of 1994, inflation hit a record 126%
(annual rate),  and real GDP dropped an estimated 5% for the year as a whole,
the worst  decline in Turkey's post-war history. At the same time, the government
 missed key 1994 targets stipulated in the IMF agreement: the budget deficit
 is estimated to have overshot the government's goal by 47%; the total  public
sector borrowing requirement likely reached 10%-12% of GDP, rather  than 8.5%
called for in the program; and the Turkish lira's value fell 5%  to 7% more
than expected. The unprecedented effort by the Kurdistan  Workers' Party (PKK)
to raise the economic costs of its insurgency against  the Turkish state is
adding to Turkey's economic problems. Attacks against  tourists have jeopardized
tourist revenues, which account for about 3% of  GDP, while economic activity
in southeastern Turkey, where most of the  violence occurs, has dropped considerably.
Turkish officials are now  negotiating a new letter of intent with the IMF
that will stipulate more  realistic macroeconomic goals for 1995 and allow
the release of remaining  funds of the standby agreement.
