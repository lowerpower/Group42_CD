<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor
soil.  The country has no known mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence
 farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. The islands are
 too small and too remote for development of a tourist industry. Government
 revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker  remittances.
Substantial income is received annually from an international  trust fund
established in 1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported  also by Japan
and South Korea.
