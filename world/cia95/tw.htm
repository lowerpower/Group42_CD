<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable government
 guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial government ownership
 of some large banks and industrial firms. Real growth in GNP has averaged
 about 9% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has been even
 faster and has provided the impetus for industrialization. Inflation and
 unemployment are remarkably low. Agriculture contributes about 4% to GDP,
 down from 35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13 among major  trading
countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily  being replaced
with more capital- and technology-intensive industries.  Taiwan has become
a major investor in China, Thailand, Indonesia, the  Philippines, Malaysia,
and Vietnam. The tightening of labor markets has led  to an influx of foreign
workers, both legal and illegal.
