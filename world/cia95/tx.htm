<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Turkmenistan is largely desert country with nomadic cattle raising,
 intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and huge gas and oil resources.
 Half its irrigated land is planted in cotton making it the world's tenth
 largest producer. It also has the world's fifth largest reserves of natural
 gas and significant oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had
 experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states  because
its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and gas and  a sharp
increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's refusal to  export Turkmen
gas to hard currency markets and mounting debts of its major  customers in
the former USSR for gas deliveries contributed to a sharp fall  in industrial
production and caused the budget to shift from a surplus to a  slight deficit.
Furthermore, with an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in  power and a tribally-based
social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a  cautious approach to economic
reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to  sustain its inefficient economy.
With the onset of economic hard times,  even cautious moves toward economic
restructuring and privatization have  slowed down. For 1995, Turkmenistan
will face continuing constraints on its  earnings because of its customers'
inability to pay for their gas and a low  average cotton crop in 1994. Turkmenistan
is working hard to open new gas  export channels through Iran and Turkey,
but these may take many years to  realize.
