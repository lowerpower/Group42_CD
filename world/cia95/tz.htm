<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy
is  heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 58% of GDP,
 provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Topography and
 climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated crops to only 5% of the land
 area. Industry accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing
 agricultural products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery  program
announced in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in  agricultural production
and financial support for the program by bilateral  donors. The World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral  donors have provided funds
to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic  infrastructure. Growth in
1991-94 has featured a pickup in industrial  production and a substantial
increase in output of minerals, led by gold.  Recent banking reforms have
helped increase private sector growth and  investment.
