<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils,
regular  rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. Agriculture
is  the most important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work
 force. Coffee is the major export crop and accounts for the bulk of export
 revenues. Since 1986 the government - with the support of foreign countries
 and international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the
 economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export
 crops, increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service
 wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and
 boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-94, the economy turned in
 a solid performance based on continued investment in the rehabilitation of
 infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports, and  gradually
improving domestic security. The economy again prospered in 1994  with rapid
growth, low inflation, growing foreign investment, a trimmed  bureaucracy,
and the continued return of exiled Indian-Ugandan  entrepreneurs.
