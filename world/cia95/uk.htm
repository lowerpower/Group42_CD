<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial centers,
 and its economy ranks among the four largest in Western Europe. The economy
 is essentially capitalistic; over the past 13 years the ruling Tories have
 greatly reduced public ownership and contained the growth of social welfare
 programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by 
European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the
 labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and  primary
energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest  shares of any
industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance,  and business
services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP  while industry
continues to decline in importance, now employing only 25%  of the work force
and generating only 21% of GDP. The economy registered  4.2% GDP growth in
1994, its fastest annual rate for six years. Exports and  manufacturing output
are the primary engines of growth. Unemployment is  gradually falling. Inflation
is at the lowest level in 27 years, but  British monetary authorities raised
interest rates to 6.25% in 1994 in a  preemptive strike on emerging inflationary
pressures such as higher taxes  and rising manufacturing costs. The combination
of a buoyant economy and  fiscal tightening is projected to trim the FY94/95
budget shortfall to  about $50 billion - down from about $75 billion in FY93/94.
The major  economic policy question for Britain in the 1990s is the terms
on which it  participates in the financial and economic integration of Europe.
