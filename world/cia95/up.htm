<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most important
 economic component of the former Soviet Union, producing more than three
 times the output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil  generated
more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms  provided
substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to  other republics.
Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied  equipment and raw materials
to industrial and mining sites in other regions  of the former USSR. In early
1992, the Ukrainian government liberalized  most prices and erected a legal
framework for privatization, but widespread  resistance to reform within the
government and the legislature soon stalled  reform efforts and led to some
backtracking. Loose monetary and fiscal  policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary
levels in late 1993. Greater  monetary and fiscal restraint lowered inflation
in 1994, but also  contributed to an accelerated decline in industrial output.
Since his  election in July 1994, President KUCHMA has developed - and parliament
has  approved - a comprehensive economic reform program, maintained financial
 discipline, and reduced state controls over prices, the exchange rate, and
 foreign trade. Implementation of KUCHMA's economic agenda will encounter
 considerable resistance from parliament, entrenched bureaucrats, and  industrial
interests and will contribute to further declines in output and  rising unemployment
which will sorely test the government's ability to stay  the course on reform
in 1995.
