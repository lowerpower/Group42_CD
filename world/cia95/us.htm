<h3>Geography</h3>

<p>
<b>Location:</b> North America, bordering both the North Atlantic Ocean and the North
 Pacific Ocean, between Canada and Mexico 

<p>
<b>Map references:</b> North America  

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total area:</i> 9,372,610 sq km  
<br><i>land area:</i> 9,166,600 sq km  
<br><i>comparative area:</i> about half the size of Russia; about three-tenths the size of Africa;
about  one-half the size of South America (or slightly larger than Brazil);
 slightly smaller than China; about two and one-half times the size of  Western
Europe 
<br><i>note:</i> includes only the 50 states and District of Columbia 

<p>
<b>Land boundaries:</b> total 12,248 km, Canada 8,893 km (including 2,477 km with Alaska),
Cuba 29  km (US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay), Mexico 3,326 km  

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 19,924 km  

<p>
<b>Maritime claims:</b> 
<br><i>contiguous zone:</i> 12 nm 
<br><i>continental shelf:</i> not specified 
<br><i>exclusive economic zone:</i> 200 nm 
<br><i>territorial sea:</i> 12 nm 

<p>
<b>International disputes:</b> maritime boundary disputes with Canada (Dixon Entrance, Beaufort Sea,
 Strait of Juan de Fuca, Machias Seal Island); US Naval Base at Guantanamo
 Bay is leased from Cuba and only mutual agreement or US abandonment of the
 area can terminate the lease; Haiti claims Navassa Island; US has made no
 territorial claim in Antarctica (but has reserved the right to do so) and
 does not recognize the claims of any other nation; Republic of Marshall 
Islands claims Wake Island 

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> mostly temperate, but tropical in Hawaii and Florida and arctic in
Alaska,  semiarid in the great plains west of the Mississippi River and arid
in the  Great Basin of the southwest; low winter temperatures in the northwest
are  ameliorated occasionally in January and February by warm chinook winds
from  the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains 

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> vast central plain, mountains in west, hills and low mountains in east;
 rugged mountains and broad river valleys in Alaska; rugged, volcanic  topography
in Hawaii 

<p>

<b>Irrigated land:</b> 181,020 sq km (1989 est.) 

<p>
<b>Environment:</b> 
<br><i>current issues:</i> air pollution resulting in acid rain in both the US and Canada; the

 fuels; water pollution from runoff of pesticides and fertilizers; very  limited
natural fresh water resources in much of the western part of the  country
require careful management; desertification 
<br><i>natural hazards:</i> tsunamis, volcanoes, and earthquake activity around Pacific Basin;
 hurricanes along the Atlantic coast; tornadoes in the midwest; mudslides
in  California; forest fires in the west; flooding; permafrost in northern
 Alaska is a major impediment to development

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced
economy  in the world, with a per capita GDP of $25,850, the largest among
major  industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with most decisions
made  by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases
of  goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 the
 economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the  longest
in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and  consumer
price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of  the labor
force. In 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a  combination of
factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates,  Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices,  and a general decline
in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output  fell by 0.6%, unemployment
grew, and signs of recovery proved premature.  Growth picked up to 2.3% in
1992 and to 3.1% in 1993. Unemployment,  however, declined only gradually,
the increase in GDP being mainly  attributable to gains in output per worker.
The year 1994 witnessed a solid  4% gain in real output, a low inflation rate
of 2.6%, and a drop in  unemployment below 6%. The capture of both houses
of Congress by the  Republicans in the elections of 8 November 1994 means
substantial changes  are likely in US economic policy, including changes in
the ways the US will  address its major economic problems in 1995-96. These
problems include  inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly
rising medical  costs of an aging population, and sizable budget and trade
deficits.
