<h3>Economy</h3>

<b>Overview:</b> One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina has a high population
 density and a high population growth rate, few natural resources, and a 
fragile soil. Economic development is hindered by a poor communications  network
within a landlocked country. Agriculture provides about 40% of GDP  and is
mainly of a subsistence nature. Industry, dominated by unprofitable  government-controlled
corporations, accounts for about 15% of GDP.  Following the 50% currency devaluation
in January 1994, the government  updated its development program in conjunction
with international agencies.  Even with the best of plans, however, the government
faces formidable  problems on all sides.
