<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 10% consists of intensely
 cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It is one of the poorest states of the
 former USSR with 60% of its population living in overpopulated rural  communities.
Nevertheless, Uzbekistan is the world's third largest cotton  exporter, a
major producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally  significant producer
of chemicals and machinery. Since independence, the  government has sought
to prop up the Soviet-style command economy with  subsidies and tight controls
on prices and production. Such policies have  buffered the economy from the
sharp declines in output and high inflation  experienced by many other former
Soviet republics. They had become  increasingly unsustainable, however, as
inflation moves along at 14% per  month and as Russia has forced the Uzbek
government to introduce its own  currency. Faced with mounting economic problems,
the government has begun  to move on a reform agenda and cooperate with international
financial  institutions, announced an acceleration of privatization, and stepped
up  efforts to attract foreign investors. Nevertheless, the regime is likely
to  find it difficult to sustain its drive for economic reform.
