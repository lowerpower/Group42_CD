<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving away from
the  planned economic model toward a more effective market-based economic
 system. Most prices are now fully decontrolled, and the Vietnamese currency
 has been effectively devalued and floated at world market rates. In  addition,
the scope for private sector activity has been expanded,  primarily through
decollectivization of the agricultural sector and  introduction of laws giving
legal recognition to private business. Nearly  three-quarters of export earnings
are generated by only two commodities,  rice and crude oil. Led by industry
and construction, the economy did well  in 1993 and 1994 with output rising
7% and 9% respectively. However, the  industrial sector remains burdened by
noncompetitive state-owned  enterprises the government is unwilling or unable
to privatize.  Unemployment looms as a serious problem with roughly 20% of
the work force  without jobs and with population growth swelling the ranks
of the labor  force yearly.
