<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to extract
and  process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP. Namibia
 is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa and the  world's
fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are  among the
richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for  gem-quality diamonds.
Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc,  tin, silver, and tungsten.
More than half the population depends on  agriculture (largely subsistence
agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia  must import some of its food.
