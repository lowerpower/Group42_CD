<h3>Government</h3>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
 Arragements ("the DOP"), Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and  responsibilities
to the Palestinian Authority, and subsequently to an  elected Palestinian
Council, as part of interim self-governing arrangements  in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities  for the Gaza Strip
and Jericho has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4  May 1994 Cairo Agreement
on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. A transfer  of powers and responsibilities
in certain spheres for the rest of the West  Bank has taken place pursuant
to the Israel-PLO 29 August 1994 Agreement on  Preparatory Transfer of Powers
and Responsibilities. The DOP provides that  Israel will retain responsibility
during the transitional period for  external security and for internal security
and public order of settlements  and Israelis. Final status is to be determined
through direct negotiations  within five years.

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military
 administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising (intifadah). 
Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
 been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli  policies.
Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not  productive
assets that would enable local Palestinian firms to compete with  Israeli
industry. GDP has been substantially supplemented by remittances of  workers
employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states. Such transfers from the  Gulf
dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of the  Persian
Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank,  increasing
unemployment, and export revenues have dropped because of the  decline of
markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to  curtail the intifadah
also have added to unemployment and lowered living  standards. The area's
economic situation has worsened since Israel's  partial closure of the territories
in 1993.
