<h3>Economy</h3>

<b>Overview:</b> The economy is limited to traditional subsistence agriculture, with
about  80% of the labor force earning its livelihood from agriculture (coconuts
 and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs), and fishing. About 4% of the  population
is employed in government. Revenues come from French Government  subsidies,
licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import  taxes, and remittances
from expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and  Futuna imports food
- particularly sugar and beef - fuel, clothing,  machinery, and transport
equipment, but its exports are negligible,  consisting of copra and handicrafts.
