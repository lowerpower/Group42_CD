<b>Type:</b> legal status of territory and question of sovereignty unresolved; territory
 contested by Morocco and Polisario Front (Popular Front for the Liberation
 of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro), which in February 1976 formally 
proclaimed a government in exile of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic 
(SADR); territory partitioned between Morocco and Mauritania in April 1976,
 with Morocco acquiring northern two-thirds; Mauritania, under pressure from
 Polisario guerrillas, abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979;
 Morocco moved to occupy that sector shortly thereafter and has since  asserted
administrative control; the Polisario's government in exile was  seated as
an OAU member in 1984; guerrilla activities continued  sporadically, until
a UN-monitored cease-fire was implemented 6 September  1991

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Western Sahara, a territory poor in natural resources and having little
 rainfall, depends on pastoral nomadism, fishing, and phosphate mining as
 the principal sources of income for the population. Most of the food for
 the urban population must be imported. All trade and other economic  activities
are controlled by the Moroccan Government. Incomes and standards  of living
are substantially below the Moroccan level.
