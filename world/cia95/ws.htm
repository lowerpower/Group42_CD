<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force, contributes
50% to  GDP, and furnishes 90% of exports. The bulk of export earnings comes
from  the sale of coconut oil and copra. The economy depends on emigrant 
remittances and foreign aid to support a level of imports much greater than
 export earnings. Tourism has become the most important growth industry. The
 economy continued to falter in 1994, as remittances and tourist earnings
 remained low. Production of taro, the primary food export crop, has dropped
 97% since a fungal disease struck the crop in 1993. The rapid growth in 
1994 of the giant African snail population in Western Samoa is also  threatening
the country's basic food crops, such as bananas and coconuts.
