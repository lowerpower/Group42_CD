<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies more
than  60% of the population and contributes nearly 25% to GDP. Manufacturing,
 which includes a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another
 quarter of GDP. Mining has declined in importance in recent years;  high-grade
iron ore deposits were depleted by 1978, and health concerns cut  world demand
for asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the  main earners
of hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a  short border with
Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South  Africa, from which it
receives 90% of its imports and to which it sends  about half of its exports.
Remittances from Swazi workers in South African  mines may supplement domestically
produced income by as much as 20%.
