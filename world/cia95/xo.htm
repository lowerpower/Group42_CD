<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>
<b>Location:</b> body of water between Africa, Antarctica, Asia, and Australia 

<p>
<b>Map references:</b> World  

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total area:</i> 73.6 million sq km  
<br><i>comparative area:</i> slightly less than eight times the size of the US; third-largest ocean
 (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the Arctic 
Ocean) 
<br><i>note:</i> includes Arabian Sea, Bass Straight, Bay of Bengal, Great Australian
Bight,  Gulf of Oman, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of Malacca, and other
tributary  water bodies 

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 66,526 km  

<p>
<b>International disputes:</b> some maritime disputes (see littoral states) 

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to October);
 tropical cyclones occur during May/June and October/November in the  northern
Indian Ocean and January/February in the southern Indian Ocean 

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system
of  currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of surface currents
 in the northern Indian Ocean, low atmospheric pressure over southwest Asia
 from hot, rising, summer air results in the southwest monsoon and  southwest-to-northeast
winds and currents, while high pressure over  northern Asia from cold, falling,
winter air results in the northeast  monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds
and currents; ocean floor is  dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and
subdivided by the Southeast  Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge,
and Ninety East Ridge;  maximum depth is 7,258 meters in the Java Trench 


<p>
<b>Natural resources:</b> oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
 deposits, polymetallic nodules  

<p>
<b>Environment:</b> 
<br><i>current issues:</i> endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales;
 oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea 
<br><i>natural hazards:</i> ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme south near Antarctica
from  May to October 
<br><i>international agreements:</i> NA  

<p>
<b>Note:</b> major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of
 Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait

<b>Overview:</b> The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle East,
 Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries a  particularly
heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the  oilfields of the
Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of great and  growing importance
to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and  export. Fishing fleets
from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit  the Indian Ocean, mainly
for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of  hydrocarbons are being tapped in the
offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran,  India, and western Australia. An estimated
40% of the world's offshore oil  production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach
sands rich in heavy minerals  and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited
by bordering countries,  particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri
Lanka, and Thailand. 

<p>
<b>Industries:</b> based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly fish, minerals,
 oil and gas, fishing, sand and gravel
