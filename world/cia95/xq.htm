<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>
<b>Location:</b> body of water mostly north of the Arctic Circle 

<p>
<b>Map references:</b> Arctic Region  

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total area:</i> 14.056 million sq km  
<br><i>comparative area:</i> slightly more than 1.5 times the size of the US; smallest of the world's
 four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean) 
<br><i>note:</i> includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian
 Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea,  Northwest
Passage, and other tributary water bodies 

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 45,389 km  

<p>
<b>International disputes:</b> some maritime disputes (see littoral states); Svalbard is the focus
of a  maritime boundary dispute between Norway and Russia 

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow
annual  temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous darkness,
cold and  stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers characterized
by  continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain
or  snow 

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that
averages  about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges may be three
times  that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral Stream, but
nearly  straight line movement from the New Siberian Islands (Russia) to Denmark
 Strait (between Greenland and Iceland); the ice pack is surrounded by open
 seas during the summer, but more than doubles in size during the winter and
 extends to the encircling land masses; the ocean floor is about 50%  continental
shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a  central basin
interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera,  Nansen Cordillera,
and Lomonsov Ridge); maximum depth is 4,665 meters in  the Fram Basin 

<p>
<b>Natural resources:</b> sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules,
oil and  gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales)  

<p>
<b>Environment:</b> 
<br><i>current issues:</i> endangered marine species include walruses and whales; fragile ecosystem
 slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage 
<br><i>natural hazards:</i> ice islands occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island;
 icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern
 Canada; permafrost in islands; virtually icelocked from October to June;
 ships subject to superstructure icing from October to May 
<br><i>international agreements:</i> NA  

<p>
<b>Note:</b> major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the
 Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); strategic location between North  America
and Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern  and western
Russia, floating research stations operated by the US and  Russia; maximum
snow cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters  over the frozen ocean
and lasts about 10 months

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of natural resources,
 including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and seals. 

<p><hr>
<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>
<b>Ports:</b> Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay (US) 

<p>
<b>Note:</b> sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the Northwest
Passage  (North America) and Northern Sea Route (Eurasia) are important seasonal
 waterways

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>
<b>Telephone system:</b> 
<br><i>international:</i> no submarine cables
