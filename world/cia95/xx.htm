<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Led by recovery in Western Europe and strong performances by the US,
 Canada, and key Third World countries, real global output - gross world 
product (GWP) - rose 3% in 1994 compared with 2% in 1993. Results varied 
widely among regions and countries. Average growth of 3% in the GDP of  industrialized
countries (60% of GWP in 1994) and average growth of 6% in  the GDP of less
developed countries (34% of GWP) were partly offset by a  further 11% drop
in the GDP of the former USSR/Eastern Europe area (now  only 6% of GWP). With
the notable exception of Japan at 2.9%, unemployment  was typically 5%-12%
in the industrial world. The US accounted for 22% of  GWP in 1994; Western
Europe accounted for another 22%; and Japan accounted  for 8%. These are the
three "economic superpowers" which are presumably  destined to compete for
mastery in international markets on into the 21st  century. As for the less
developed countries, China, India, and the Four  Dragons - South Korea, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, and Singapore - once again posted  records of 5% growth or better;
however, many other countries, especially  in Africa, continued to suffer
from drought, rapid population growth,  inflation, and civil strife. Central
Europe made considerable progress in  moving toward "market-friendly" economies,
whereas the 15 ex-Soviet  countries (with the notable exceptions of the three
Baltic states)  typically experienced further declines in output, sometimes
as high as 30%.  Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock economic-political
institution,  is steadily losing control over international flows of people,
goods,  funds, and technology. Internally, the central government in a number
of  cases is losing control over resources as separatist regional movements
-  typically based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states
 of the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, and in India. In  Western
Europe, governments face the difficult political problem of  channeling resources
away from welfare programs in order to increase  investment and strengthen
incentives to seek employment. The addition of  nearly 100 million people
each year to an already overcrowded globe is  exacerbating the problems of
pollution, desertification, underemployment,  epidemics, and famine. Because
of their own internal problems, the  industrialized countries have inadequate
resources to deal effectively with  the poorer areas of the world, which,
at least from the economic point of  view, are becoming further marginalized.

entries in this  volume.) 

<p>
<b>National product:</b> GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power parity - $30.7 trillion
(1994  est.) 

<p>
<b>National product real growth rate:</b> 3.2% (1994 est.) 

<p>
<b>National product per capita:</b> $5,400 (1994 est.)

<b>Inflation rate (consumer prices):</b> 
<br><i>all countries:</i> 25%  
<br><i>developed countries:</i> 5%  
<br><i>developing countries:</i> 50% (1994 est.) 
<br><i>note:</i> national inflation rates vary widely in individual cases, from stable
 prices to hyperinflation 

<p>
<b>Unemployment rate:</b> 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized
 countries; developed countries typically 5%-12% unemployment 

<p>
<b>Exports:</b> $4 trillion (f.o.b., 1994 est.) 
<br><i>commodities:</i> the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and services 

<br><i>partners:</i> in value, about 75% of exports from the developed countries 

<p>
<b>Imports:</b> $4.1 trillion (c.i.f., 1994 est.) 
<br><i>commodities:</i> the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and services 

<br><i>partners:</i> in value, about 75% of imports by the developed countries 

<p>
<b>External debt:</b> $1 trillion for less developed countries (1993 est.) 

<p>
<b>Industrial production:</b> growth rate 5% (1994 est.) 

<p>
<b>Electricity:</b> 
<br><i>capacity:</i> 2,773,000,000 kW 
<br><i>production:</i> 11.601 trillion kWh  
<br><i>consumption per capita:</i> 1,937 kWh (1993) 

<p>
<b>Industries:</b> industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, especially
in  computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical  equipment;
most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small  portion of
non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these  technological
forces, and the technological gap between the industrial  nations and the
less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid  development of new
industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating  already grim environmental
problems 

<p>
<b>Agriculture:</b> the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the
last  20 years; the annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen
by 50%,  from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons;
 production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
 increases in planted areas; while global production is sufficient for  aggregate
demand, about one-fifth of the world's population remains  malnourished, primarily
because local production cannot adequately provide  for large and rapidly
growing populations, which are too poor to pay for  food imports; conditions
are especially bad in Africa where drought in  recent years has intensified
the consequences of overpopulation
