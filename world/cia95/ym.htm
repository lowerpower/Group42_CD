<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united
Yemen,  the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is
the  economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends
 heavily on Western-assisted development of the country's moderate oil  resources.
Former South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly from  the steady
decline in Soviet economic support. The low level of domestic  industry and
agriculture has made northern Yemen dependent on imports for  practically
all of its essential needs. Once self-sufficient in food  production, northern
Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for  export crops - cotton,
fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to  growing a shrub called qat,
whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant  effect by Yemenis and which has
no significant export market. Economic  growth in former South Yemen has been
constrained by a lack of incentives,  partly stemming from centralized control
over production decisions,  investment allocation, and import choices. Yemen's
large trade deficits  have been compensated for by remittances from Yemenis
working abroad and by  foreign aid. Since the Gulf crisis, remittances have
dropped substantially.  Growth in 1994-95 is constrained by low oil prices,
rapid inflation, and  political deadlock that are causing a lack of economic
cooperation and  leadership. However, a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia
in February 1995  and the expectation of a rise in oil prices brighten Yemen's
economic  prospects.
