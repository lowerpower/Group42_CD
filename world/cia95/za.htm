<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Prior to 1993 the economy had been in decline for more than a decade
with  falling imports and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stemmed
 largely from a chronically depressed level of copper production and weak
 copper prices, generally ineffective economic policies, and high inflation.
 An annual population growth of 3% brought a decline in per capita GDP of
 50% over the decade. However, economic reforms enacted since 1992 have  helped
reduce inflation, have begun to strengthen the social safety net,  and have
been accompanied by GDP growth at an estimated 6.8% in 1993 and 4%  in 1994.
The huge external debt remains a key problem.
