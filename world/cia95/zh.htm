<h3>Geography</h3>

<p>
<b>Location:</b> body of water between Africa, Antarctica, and the Western Hemisphere 


<p>
<b>Map references:</b> World  

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total area:</i> 82.217 million sq km  
<br><i>comparative area:</i> slightly less than nine times the size of the US; second-largest of
the  world's four oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than Indian
Ocean  or Arctic Ocean) 
<br><i>note:</i> includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark
 Strait, Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea,  Norwegian
Sea, Scotia Sea, Weddell Sea, and other tributary water bodies 

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 111,866 km  

<p>
<b>International disputes:</b> some maritime disputes (see littoral states) 

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa near
Cape  Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can occur
from  May to December, but are most frequent from August to November 

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait,
and  Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm water gyre (broad, circular
 system of currents) in the northern Atlantic, counterclockwise warm water
 gyre in the southern Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the  Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic  basin; maximum
depth is 8,605 meters in the Puerto Rico Trench 

<p>
<b>Natural resources:</b> oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales), sand and
 gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, precious stones
 

<p>
<b>Environment:</b> 
<br><i>current issues:</i> endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles,
 and whales; driftnet fishing is exacerbating declining fish stocks and  contributing
to international disputes; municipal sludge pollution off  eastern US, southern
Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in  Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico,
Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North  Sea; industrial waste and municipal
sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North  Sea, and Mediterranean Sea 
<br><i>natural hazards:</i> icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the northwestern
 Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been spotted as far south
 as Bermuda and the Madeira Islands; icebergs from Antarctica occur in the
 extreme southern Atlantic Ocean; ships subject to superstructure icing in
 extreme northern Atlantic from October to May and extreme southern Atlantic
 from May to October; persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to
 September 
<br><i>international agreements:</i> NA  

<p>
<b>Note:</b> major choke points include the Dardanelles, Strait of Gibraltar, access
to  the Panama and Suez Canals; strategic straits include the Strait of Dover,
 Straits of Florida, Mona Passage, The Sound (Oresund), and Windward  Passage;
the Equator divides the Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic  Ocean and
South Atlantic Ocean

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Atlantic Ocean provides some of the world's most heavily trafficked
sea  routes, between and within the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Other
 economic activity includes the exploitation of natural resources, e.g., 
fishing, the dredging of aragonite sands (The Bahamas), and production of
 crude oil and natural gas (Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and North Sea).

 (Spain), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Casablanca (Morocco), Colon (Panama),
 Copenhagen (Denmark), Dakar (Senegal), Gdansk (Poland), Hamburg (Germany),

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>
<b>Telephone system:</b> 
<br><i>international:</i> numerous submarine cables with most between continental Europe and
the UK,  North America and the UK, and in the Mediterranean; numerous direct
links  across Atlantic via INTELSAT satellite network
