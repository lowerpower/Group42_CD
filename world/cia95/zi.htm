<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and supplies almost
 40% of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining,
 produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for
 only 5% of both GDP and employment, but minerals and metals account for 
about 40% of exports. Severe drought caused GDP to drop 8% in 1992, with 
growth rebounding to 2% in 1993 and 3.5% in 1994. Despite the lingering  effects
of the drought on economic and social conditions, the government is  continuing
to push its IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program aimed  at encouraging
exports and foreign investment.
