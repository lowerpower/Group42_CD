<p><hr>
<h3>Geography</h3>

<p>
<b>Location:</b> body of water between Antarctica, Asia, Australia, and the Western
 Hemisphere 

<p>
<b>Map references:</b> World  

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total area:</i> 165.384 million sq km  
<br><i>comparative area:</i> about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed by the
 Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about  one-third
of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the  world 
<br><i>note:</i> includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Coral
 Sea, East China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Tonkin, Java Sea,
 Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South 
China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies 

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 135,663 km  

<p>
<b>International disputes:</b> some maritime disputes (see littoral states) 

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the
summer  months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land,
and a  dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian
 land mass back to the ocean 

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a clockwise,
 warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in the southern 
Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the northern Pacific sea
 ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in winter; in the southern
 Pacific sea ice from Antarctica reaches its northernmost extent in October;
 the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific 
Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including 
the world's deepest, the 10,924 meter Marianas Trench 

<p>
<b>Natural resources:</b> oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates,
 placer deposits, fish  

<p>
<b>Environment:</b> 
<br><i>current issues:</i> endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter,
seals,  turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China
Sea 
<br><i>natural hazards:</i> surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes
 referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire; subject to tropical cyclones  (typhoons)
in southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent  from July
to October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of  Mexico and
strike Central America and Mexico from June to October (most  common in August
and September); southern shipping lanes subject to  icebergs from Antarctica;
occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the  coast of Peru when the trade
winds slacken and the warm Equatorial  Countercurrent moves south, killing
the plankton that is the primary food  source for anchovies; consequently,
the anchovies move to better feeding  grounds, causing resident marine birds
to starve by the thousands because  of their lost food source;  ships subject
to superstructure icing in  extreme north from October to May and in extreme
south from May to October;  persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be
a maritime hazard from June  to December 
<br><i>international agreements:</i> NA  

<p>
<b>Note:</b> the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
 and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
 North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; dotted with low coral  islands
and rugged volcanic islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean

<h3>Economy</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview:</b> The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and 
particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides  low-cost
sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing  grounds, offshore
oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the  construction industry.
In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's fish catch  came from the Pacific Ocean,
which is the only ocean where the fish catch  has increased every year since
1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and gas  reserves is playing an ever-increasing
role in the energy supplies of  Australia, NZ, China, US, and Peru. The high
cost of recovering offshore  oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in
world prices for oil since  1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.
