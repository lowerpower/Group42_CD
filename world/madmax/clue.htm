<h3>Having a Clue in College.</h3>

        Your young, your free, you have no clue.  Ahh to be back in
school again at the ripe age of 18.  I remember it well.  To bad most
of us had no clue about the advantages of being a student (expecally if
your parents are footing the bill.)  Gee, if I knew what I knew now back
then, I'd be dangerious.<p>

        Few people relalize that College should be a <b><i>celebration of life.</i>
</b>
So I am offering some helpfull advice (remember what your paying for it)
to make things a little easyer for you:<p>
<UL>
        <LI>Spring Break, must do situation, beg to you parents, steal from
           your roomates, sell your body, but do it, you will talk about
           it forever.

        <LI>Get involved with at least one, if not more, extra-curricular
                activities.  College is not just studying and beer.

        <LI>Fucking Women For Sport, although it seems cool at the time,
                is an empty experiance.  Relationships with meaning
                (even if there are multiple) bring a healtier life.

        <LI>Grades are not that important.  Special projects are.

        <LI>Talk to your professors, get to know them, help them
                with there research.

        <LI>Meet and socailize with everyone.  Give everyone a chance,
                look past things that may turn you off or are not
                what you are used to.

        <LI>Try to go see as many films, concerts, sporting events, and
                lectures as you can stand.

        <LI>Be nice to everyone who is nice to you.

        <LI>Don't take any shit from assholes, you probably had enough
                of that in High School.

        <LI>If you want to drink but are underage, brew beer, make
           wine or distill
           your own alchohol.  You don't need to be 21 to buy all the
           ingrediants you need, and you can get much higher quality
           product.

        <LI>If you are male and don't have a SO, <b>never</b>, and I
                mean never bring a date to a wedding.  Weddings are
                one of the mose fertal grounds for finding high
                quality female compainionship.  You have the added
                bonus that they have been weakened by the event of the
                day.
