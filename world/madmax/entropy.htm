<h3>Entropy always...</h3>

Entropy, always wins they say,<br>
But fight I must, win I may<br>
I'll fuck lots of women and have lots of kids<br>
Propagate my genes, to the end they'll spread<br>
<p>
Entropy, the battle being fought right now,<br>
my ideas must live on, someway, somehow<br>
I'll write a few books, burn a few vids,<br>
and I'll live on, yes I will live<br>
<p>
Entropy, always wins in the end, its said<br>
but continue I must, long after dead<br>
I'll upload my sole, Give it computer control<br>
cruze past the dead to the end and my goal<br>
<p>
Entropy always wins, it is the way<br>
so live life to the fullest, every day<br>
Don't look back and wish that you did<br>
do it all now and prove that you lived<br>
