<h3>Well is it fair</h3>

welfare, ha, your not my friend<br>
you bury the people, in the end    <br>
gernerations of lost hope you feed     <br>
destruction of famlies is your need        <br>
an illusion of of hope that you pretend        <br>
is the wasting of soles that will never mend       <br>
wastfull bureaucracy is what you breed                 <br>
the middle class is what you bleed                         <br>
tentions of race is your rift    <br>
stagnation of life is your gift      <br>
                                         <br>
welfare, ha, put me to bed                   <br>
it is now work, self esteam that I dread         <br>
you provide for me an existance no doubt             <br>
so I'll just sit here and watch TV                       <br>
                                                             <br>
