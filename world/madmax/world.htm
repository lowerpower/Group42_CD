<h2>Exploring The World</h2>
<b>By Mad Max of Group42</b>
<p>
<b>The world</b> is an interesting place.  Unfortunatly most people
in the U.S. (and mostlikly other countries) have a very narrow, centrist
view of
it.  This myopic vision is a dangerious thing.  It leads the world into
most of its problems.  Fortunatly <i>hackers</i> are explorers, open to new
ideas and info.  They can use this open architecture of there mind to
reach out and understand the feelings and views of others that may
or maynot share their country or culture.  This is a powerful thing that
can be translated to power, wealth, and freedom for those that can
understand this.<p>
<b>Experiance</b>, the act of doing is the most powerful way to learn.
Traval and contact with the world has no substitute.  One who has
travled, lived like a native in many lands, is a very wealthy man
indeed.<p>
<b>Reading</b> is the cornerstone of understanding, overshadowed only
by experiance itself.  Reading is a good way to gain prespective and
be informed of anothers ways and views.  It is a way to gather ideas
to let fester in ones own mind, to select and make the most of
experiances, and to step into a anothers mind.
<p>
<b>Armed</b> with knowledge, go out and do.  Don't just sit.
There is a world of many experiances to experiance.  Life doesn't
end at the TV Set, Computer, and Job.  The United States of America
is not the only countery in the world and being American doesn't
make you better or worse than anyone else in the world, just different.
Explore these differences. Explore life and live.<p>
