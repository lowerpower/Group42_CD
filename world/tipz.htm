<h3>Tipz From a 28 Year Old Boy Scout</h3>
<h4>by Stevyn of the <a href="../zines/ironfeth/plink.htm">IFJ</a></h4>
<b>My heart</b> is pounding, my spider senses are tingling, my mind is
aware of humans struggling to be on top and willing to step on yer back,
love, blood and toes.  You are on yer own in a deadly yet very
beautiful world.  Be sure to notice and enjoy the incredable planet
we live on, but also thing of Las Vegas and remember how twisted
our world can be. <b><i>Be Prepared</i></b>, da dam fine motto to
say.  Here is some common sense just for you:<p>
<b>Always avoid</b> traffic, drive defensive, stay alert, as a pedestrian
do your best to avoid moving cars.  Watch traffic carefully.
<p>
<b>Find quality</b> phriends.  A handfull of close tight phriends is
worth more than anything else!
<p>
<b>When you</b> talk to strangers you are revealing way more than you even
realize!  Learn to be quiet and keep yer life private.  Blabbing and bragging
is a mistake.<p>
<b>Listen and Learn.</b> Learn everything yer phriend may wish to share.
<i>All</i> skills and knowledge is valubale! Listen to what people say.
If they suck you will hear it when they speak.  If a person has info to
share, be sure to take tyme to ask + remember.
<p>
<b>Watch all spy</b> movies and carefully practice the life.  Mod yer car
with secret trix, Ring yer place with motion detectors and IR video cameras.
Secure everything at all tymes.  Prepare for any trouble.
<p>
<b>Study Tae Kwon Do.</b>  Make sure it is the street fighting style from a
Korean Master.  Don't waste tyme with the wrong teacher or other gentler
self-defense programs.  <b><i>Never</b></i> get in fights!  <b>
<i>Avoid</b></i> at all costs!  Having yer face busted up really sux, as
does a knife in the belly! If in a fight then don't follow the rules-
fight dirty and think of yer life at hand.
<p>
<b>Travel.</b>  Avoid trouble spots, visit an area that you can handle.
Look for adventurous land, new peoples.  Have compleate courtesy and
respect.  Try to become a native, soak up the culture and become one of
them.  Learn the real life and join the local scene.  Remember all
when you leave and always maintain contact with any phriends you have
made.  never abandon phriends.  Invite them to visit you elsewhere.
Visit them again or have a rendezvous!  The biggest thrill is to introduce
good phriends from different scenes and places.
<p>
<b>Expand yer mind.</b>  Make sure you do <i>LSD</i> at least once.  When
you do a mind altering drug such as LSD you will learn so much about yerself.
Make sure it is done while happy and at a safe comfortable place with
phriends at hand.  Enjoy the experience and think hardcore about every
little thing going on.  You will actually feel your body metabolism and
new senses you are normally unaware of.  The knowledge and experiences from
doing a trip of LSD are very unique and powerful.
<p>
<b>Don't depend</b> on anything or anyone.  Take responsibility and blame.
Try to avoid situations that involve taking responsibility or blame.
Take care of your self!  Stay healthy and alert.  Be prepared for any
situation, good or bad.
<p>
<b>Have phun.</b>  Your main goal should be to enjoy your life and have
mucho phun.  Follow your dreams.  Your job and work is to make sure
your dreams happen, don't fail yerself.  After this you should be
working on helping yer phriends achieve there dreams!
