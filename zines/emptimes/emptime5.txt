                          -=- The Empire Times -=-
                                Introduction

    Empire Times was once a rumor, but led by the know how of albatross,
they created an image, a way of life, an Empire.  We brought it back, I
thought that there was no reason to let this empire die.  This issue just
proves that we are back, and will keep going, the last issue was power-
packed, but it was not the last.  The empire lives on, through busts,
complications and hardships.

    Late?  What do you mean late?  So maybe you should just consider the
_actual_ release date about a week or so, or so, or soo after the date that
I tell you I plan to release it?  Don't bitch at me, just wait a little
while longer, at least you still read it.  I still plan on doing it on a
monthly schedule, but not exactly month after month, maybe a week or so late
every month, but it'll still be considered.  "About Monthly".  You know how
much support I get doing this?  Not much, but there are a few helping hands,
(firefly, roach..).  Other than that... I've had one complaint about this
zine, but I don't care, it's not my problem.  Manowar --> fuck off, go away,
and stop wasting my time.

    Brought back from the trenches of distractions such as irc.  I just
thought The Empire Times was something we would do for fun, but somehow
people got my mail address, and sent for copy after copy of it.  I've
assembled a mailing list for the magazine, I never thought we'd get this
kind of responses.

    Hype.  That is what everything these days is about.  I don't know if
that is good, or bad.  With all the things that have happened to the (602)
locals..  Invalid Media, VaxBuster, Merc and all them.  I don't think I
want to understand.  Whatever the case, someone is out there, someone is
leaking, but at this point, I don't care.  I remind all of you to stay safe
and not to be as open as the next person.  Invalid wrote something special
for Empire Times about the roundabout happenings in the (602) Scene.

    At this time I would like to say a few things about current (well at
the time I am writing this) events.  Invalid Media is looking to put upt
on the net.  I think that is good and bad, it's good because it'll be net
accessible, but I think it's bad because more people will try to get in.
I hope it doesn't lose it's private factor.  Reminder to all that UPT is
up, and still elite, so get the info and call.

    Digital Anarchy is going better than ever.  I'd like to mention it as
a really quality bbs, but don't want to offend the other great boards that
still exist.  Boards are 99% dead, since the erruption of the internet.
That is good in some cases, but it does take most of the fun out of dialing.
However there are some still worth calling.  Empire, Digital Anarchy, Plan-9,
Secret Techtonics, Unphamiliar Territories, Planet 10, Unauthorized Access,
Lucid Nightmare... Boards arn't the answer, but a social side, and an
alternative to irc.

    Pumpcon is coming around the corner, at the end of October.  Okinawa
thought it'd be a good idea to make it private.  Well if you've seen the
info sheet, you'd see that it's not _that_ private.  I hope it goes over
well, seeing that okinawa and ixom are putting out money, and taking the
trouble to do it.  I think all in all it will come and go, with not many
people remebering it.  That _should_ be due to the fact that pumpcon has
always been the party con(cept partycon).  Whatever happens, I'm sure it
will go over nicely.  I'm excited about it.

    Till the next Empire Times,

                                armitage@dhp.com

                           IRC, The Untold Story
                               By PuD C0ur13r

You want to IRC, but don't have a client offhand, or you a client
is too hard to compile?  Well, here's a secret for you.

You don't need a client for the irc.  Try IRC raw.

No, I don't mean a hamburger raw.  Sheesh. ;)   Really,
though, raw is pure IRC.  But personally I don't like raw irc.
Theres too much information there in Raw, and its a bit
confusing.  But with info, it should be made easy.

Any irc server can be an anonymous IRC site.  All you have to do is to telnet
to port 6667.  ie - telnet irc-2.mit.edu 6665..6667
                           irc.colorado.edu 6667
                           irc.uiuc.edu 6667
                           poe.acc.virginia.edu 6667
                           hope.gate.net 6667
                           irc.iastate.edu 6667
                           cs-pub.bu.edu 6667

Once you are connected, you need to login.  you do this with the following two
commands :

( note, do not try /user, this doesn't work)
 user [put your 'real' user name here] 0 0 :[your 'full name]

 ie - user PuD_r0ks 0 0 :PuD C0ur13r

(note - the 0's used to be fields for an ip address. However, this is obtained
via backwards checking now so these fields are redundant.  On some
systems, most notably UMD, this will not work to change the 'real' user name
because it supports the identd protocol at port 113.)

 nick [what you want your nick to be]

 ie - nick roach

(again, don't try /nick.  this is raw, not a client.)

you can join channels with

 join #channel

 ie - join #hack

(uhuhuhu, don't do /join either)

say your on #hack, and you wanna talk.  Well just do this command:

 privmsg #channel :[whatever you want to say]

 ie - privmsg #hack : y0y0y0y0, PuD r0ks.

(note, the colon is needed).

And if you privately want to message someone, try this command.

 privmsg [person's name] :[whatever else]

 ie - privmsg armitage : hey, when is the next empire times?

the only things you can't do like this that I know of are - emotes and DCC
transfers.  Emotes are lame anyway, and dcc is blocked out on most if not all
anonymous irc sites.

So there you have it.  IRC raw in a nutshell.

But if you try IRC raw, and you think "Bleh, this is pretty
wierd.  Is there any anon irc sites I can try?"

Well here are a few:

 irc.nsysu.edu.tw        login: irc
 cybernet.cse.fau.edu    login: bbs
 suncc.ccu.edu.tw        login: guest or gopher
 dallet.channel1.com     login: irc
 ilink.nis.za            login: irc
 freenet.detroit.org     login: guest

There are others, but those are the few that I know that work.

If anyone wants to update this article, or improve it (I
always need more anonymous irc sites.  I could always make a
huge article on anon IRC sites.  :) email me at roach@tmok.res.wpi.edu

SHOUTOUTS: (yhea, I want to shoutout too. ;)

armitage:  PHRACK BOY, I MEAN ARMITAGE.
shadowdancer:  d00d, watch out.  keep yourself safe.
fenris wolf:  Without you, this article could not have been
              made.  Thanks.  :)

                    DMS Family of Digital Switching Systems
                                by Erudite

In this Infoarticle I hope to cover the capablities and flexabilities of
all the DMS Digital Switching Systems, I will also talk about other
Northern Telecom Devices and Systems. The majority of the file is based
on the DMS-100 system.

First we have breif descriptions of the DMS Switches:

DMS-10
------
This is a versatile switch which is cost-effective for the duties that
it was created for.  It is a digital switch that services suburban and
rural areas.  It is in service internationally as well as in the US
(rural and suburban areas).  It allows access to local and long-distance
service.  It can handle up to 12,000 subscribers.  It is the smallest of
the DMS family.

DMS-100
-------
The purpose of the DMS-100 Switch is to provide coverage and connections
to the public network.  It is designed to deliver services over subscribers
lines and trunks.  It provides POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service), along
with very sophisticated business services such as ACD (Automatic Call
Distribution), ISDN (Integrated Service Digital Network), and MDC (Meridian
Digital Centrex).

DMS-200
-------
The DMS-200 switch has toll capabilities, it is used for toll-center
applications.  It provides TOPS (Telephone Operator Position System) which
is the world's premier operator service, from Northern Telcom.

DMS-100/200
-----------
Simply, this combines the DMS-200 Toll capabilities and applications, with
the DMS-100 public networking, which makes it possible for this switch to
service subscriber lines, long distance circuits with toll applications.

DMS-250
-------
This is the long distance tandem switch that connects long distance calls.
It is used by the interexchange carriers.  It is powerful, and they are
used to connect most of the U.S. population.

DMS-300
-------
This is the international exchange, which gates calls internationally.
It provides the most advanced range of international services.  This
international digital switch can interface with almost *any* country in
the world.  Talk about power.  It is known as the International Gateway
System.

DMS-Supernode
-------------
This is faster, and can handle more throughput that the DMS-100.

DMS-Supernode SE
----------------
This is a reduced size Supernode system, it has a DMS-Core processing
engine, DMS-Bus high-speed messaging component, the Link Peripheral
Processor (LPP), and the Enhanced Network non-blocking switching network
(ENET), which makes it a cost effective system, combined all into one
compact unit.

DMS-MTX Cellular Switch
-----------------------
Northern Telcom's Cellular Switch.  The DMS-MTX was the first cellular
switch in Northern American to offer subscribers.


       DMS Architecture & Functionality

Messaging - "DMS-Bus" is the high speed data bus connecting most components
  of the switch.  This makes the DMS-Supernode system a true step up
  communications platform.
Switching - The switching matrix calls to their destination.  Currently
  in planning is future switching fabrics that will allow for broader
  data applications, including (ATM) Asynchronous Transfer Mode.
Maintenance & Billing - The DMS Systems provide full feature testing, and
  other transaction and maintenance procedures.
Multicomputing platform - The DMS systems enables a high capacity, and other
  "information" age applications and functions.  Such as Videoconferencing,
  transmission of imaging, and dialable ds-1 backup.


       DMS Family Setup

Below will be a simple, common setup of dms systems to form a wide range
communications system.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  DEF CON Announcement


Ok, nothing too fancy in this announcement.  Just that DEF CON III is going
to be happening a little later next year, the first weekend in Augest '95
in Las Vegas.

There is a slight problem, however.  We grew too large for most of the
Hotels.  That means it is expensive for me to rent space large enough for
everything on the weekends.  Sure the convention could be during the
weekdays, and everything would cost 1/2 as much, but everyone I talk to
tells me to do it on a weekend or not at all, so...  Rooms will be around
$90 a night for a double.

We'll have three areas along one hallway.  A double section for the
speaking, a section for people to hang out and talk and a section for
computer hookups and movies.

We have a mailing list up for information, etc.  If you want to subscribe
mail majordomo@fc.net with "subscribe dc-announce" in the body of the
message.

There are lots of things being planned, but since shit always happens at
the last minute I'm not gonna say anything too early.  We'll have more of
a focus on technical hacking this year, though.

Audio tapes, shirts, etc. are still available from DC II, if you are
interested mail dtangent@defcon.org for more info.

Thanks Armitage for putting this out...

                       The Bust of Mercury (aka merc)
                            +other related busts
                              by Invalid Media

        This is the unofficial textfile describing how merc got busted. A
litte background first - merc was the cosysop of Unphamiliar Territory (and
ran the board on many occasions when I wasn't up to it), he was also a
member of "the Posse" - a group which does not exist (its a figment of
Len Rose's imagination).
        The source(s) for all of this information will not be disclosed and
real handle's will not be used to protect many people. If I were speaking of
The Dark Druid (for example) I might say Hacker A. Also please note that the
source for this information is NOT merc -- he is refusing to talk to anyone
at this point in time.

I. How it all started
        Late August, merc was playing around with his lock-picking set and
decided to go to a bar. He was standing outside of The Dirty Drummer when a
cop strolled by. He was with non-Hacker A when this occurred. They both
got questioned and promptly arrested. His truck was seized at this time.
        The morning of September 1st, merc's apartment was raided by many
different groups which include (but not limited to) Secret Service, Federal
Bureau of Investigations, IRS, Gail Thackeray (in person!).
        Merc was (allegedly) dealing with the following:
        a) Cellular telephony including engineering phones, making fraudlent
           calls via tumbling and cloning.
        b) Hacking and gaining complete control of many computer systems
           (you know, all those that the Posse are accused of hacking).
        Why was his apartment raided? Well, Gail Thackeray somehow found
out about his B&E bust and decided to take action right away - plus she
feared that he would go complete cellular and she would not be able to keep
track of his activities.

II. The following days
        Well we all knew about his B&E bust but didn't know anything else
had happened. I was on irc a couple days after merc's bust and was /msg'd
by Hacker B with something along the lines of:
        "what the hell is stuck up merc's ass? i called him and say hey and
        he just hung up on me"
        Not knowing anything other than the B&E bust, I just said that he
was most likely paranoid about it and doesn't want to take any chances until
things are completely cool again.
        Having known merc for years, I decided to give him a call since he
obviously wouldn't hang up on one of his best friends.
        RING, RING, RING... "i can't talk to you anymore..." <CLICK>
        This is where I started getting really concerned. After repeated
attempts at trying to call him and stopping over at his apartment (with
little to no luck) I decided to give some other people a call.
        Turns out, that same day Neurosis was busted, Mind Rape was visited,
and Richard Finch (a journalist who set us all up with an interview on KFYI
radio and who organized many 2600 meetings in Arizona) was also busted.
        We called up Hacker C. He told us all he knew (and it was basically
information we already knew with the following additions):
        a) merc was under investigation for at least a year
        b) a wiretap and/or datatap has been plaguing merc for at least
           an entire year.
        c) they took fingerprints at merc's apartment
        d) they didn't know much about Posse so they questioned him for hours
           on the subject

III. Other related busts
        It seems that on September 1st a lot of people were busted. On Sept-
ember 15th, a "security" user on my board, Keith Jensen of Sprint, posted
the following message:

--Begin UPT capture--

Subject: September 4th
From: sprinter@gail.upt.org (Keith Jensen - SPRINT)
Date: Thu, 15 Sep 94 16:42:25 PST
Organization: (Newsgroup) alt.neutral

September 4th at 4:09p, the Police, Secret Service and F.B.I. stormed
into the offices of Sprint in New York, promptly arrested me and seized 
all the computer equiptment in my office.

I was charged with hidering an investigation taking place in New Orleans 
into the escapades of Renegade, Dr. Demonsus, Wiseguy, and Revelation. I
have never heard of these people so please tell anything you know about
them. I was allegedly providing them with information they needed to gets
into TransUnion and Information America through Sprintnet.

According to them, I also helped them break into Government and Military 
systems to obtain more credit card information. 

They found a RS tone dialer in my office (which was not modified to make
it a red box) and charged me with possession of a toll-fraud device. I 
have no idea what is going on. My office is still empty and raided and I 
have taken an involuntary month-long vacation from Sprint until this will
clear up. Hopefully it will.

They asked me a lot of information about The Posse, my connections with
8BBS, Modem over Miami, The Phoenix Project, and MOD. I used to call some
of these boards many years ago but never did anything illegal through them
and it was over 10 years since I've heard 8BBS brought up.

A much pissed of Sprinter

--End UPT Capture--
        There were a lot of posts about Sprinter's bust as well as merc's.
The following was posted by bobby0 on the general chit-chat forum:

Would merc/mr/etc getting busted have anything to do with what happenee
er, happened to Sprinter?  The timing seems pretty close.


Read this in CU digest today:

  NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- "Dr. Demonicus," "Renegade" and four other
hackers used computerz to steal credit card numbers and used them
to buy $210,000 in gold coins and high-tech hardware, federal
prosecuters said Wednesday (Sep 8, 1994)
The nine-count indictment unsealed wednesday charged 5 men from
Lousiana and one from New York with conspiracy, computer fraut,
access device fraud, and wire fraud, US Attourney Eddie Jordan Jr. said.

Some of their hacker nicknames [gawd] were included.  They were 
identified as Dwayne "Dr. Demonicus" Comerger, 22; Brian Ursin, 21; John 
Christopher "Renegade" Montegut, 24; Timothy "Revelation" Thompson, 21;
James McGee, 25; and Raymone "Wiseguy" Savage, 25, of Richmond Hills, 
N.Y.

.. it doesn't mention phx at all, but I thought the timing was just kinda 
odd.

--End UPT Capture--

        At this point everyone is scared. A lot of hackers were busted and
the main thing they all had in common was an interest in Cellular telephony.
A week after Sprinter's post which set us all off, he posted the following:

--Begin UPT Capture--
Subject: my bust
From: sprinter@gail.upt.org (Keith Jensen - SPRINT)
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 94 16:32:36 PST
Organization: (Newsgroup) alt.neutral

This morning I was promptly visited at my house with one of the arresting 
officers (Richard Dapesio) who apologized for the arrest and quickly
brought me back all the seized equiptment. They even gave me a check for 
$75 to replace the tone dialer which they took apart and could never put
back together again.

I was told that the investigation was regarding only The Posse and many
people were visited. They told me that they apprehended all of the people 
who they were going to already (on September 1st, my bust came on the 4th
because it took them a couple more days than it should have to get the 
proper paperwork done). He said they got everyone they were looking for 
except a few who they can't find because they are mobile. The reason I 
was apprehended was because there was some information on my system that
was placed there by the New Orleans hackers (who are in the Posse group
he said) and they thought that I had given them access to my system and
its databases, but that wasn't true. They got in through a backdoor I 
have yet to find. Its running BSD, so if anyone has BSD backdoors please
let me know.

Was this Operation Sundevil II? 46 hackers busted in one day. All those 
busted were involved in credit card fraud or (the biggest fear people 
have now) cellular phone fraud. People were using tumblers to make free
phone calls from their cellular phones and that had to be quickly
stopped. If you are involved in any way with the following things, I 
would recommend stopping them:

        Cellular phone fraud using tumblers or clones
        Credit card fraud especially from Novell, Microsoft, and other
giant computer conglomerates.
        
46 hackers, 84 computers, hundreds of thousands of dollars in pirated 
software, and thousands of dollars in carding computer equiptment, 
software and cellular phones.

--End UPT Capture--

        Ouch.

IV. Conclusion

        Between August 31st and September 4th, a lot of hackers were busted.
The following is a list and reason (I'm just guessing)

Hacker          Date            Status                  Reason
------          ----            ------                  ------

Richard Finch   0?Sep94         Bust                    2600

        We don't know the current status of merc but he was always a good
hacker and friend and we wish him luck.

                       A Guide to the Wonders of LDDS
                         Metromedia and the World of
                              Operator Scamming
                                  by Entropy


      Ever find yourself at a payphone, without a redbox, code,
 card, or other device by which you might place that essential call
 to the warez boyz back home?  Now assuming you (like most of us)
 have some supernatural phear of quarters (or just dont have any)
 you will need to find some other way to place your call.  Now its simple.
 You'll never have to hear another operator say:  "Sir, how in gods name
 are you putting those quarters in so fast?"  or "Sir, you have yet to
 deposit any real money!"


 PART 1: Third Party Billing
 ---------------------------

      - Billing From an Ordinary Payphone

      You can't 3rd party bill to another payphone.  Unless of
 course you are know of a COCOT that accepts charges and doesn't
 have an evil explanatory message saying something to the affect of,
 "This is a payphone, fuck off."  It's been that way for awhile now,
 right?

      Wrong.  It can be done, it can be done easily, and it can be
 done ANYWHERE IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES.  The key is LDDS
 Metromedia, the 4th largest long distance carrier in the US.
 You've probably heard of Metromedia or some other company with a
 similar name.  They are tricksters with many divisions and they are
 protecting their kodez, therefore they are known by MANY names,
 some phone books even list LDDS Metromedia, and Metromedia as
 seperate companies, but to my knowledge they are one and the same.

      Generally you must be at a bank of phones (2 or more phonez)
 for these techniques to work, unless you are at a COCOT, but i'll
 get into that later.  Here's how it works.

      You approach a payphone in hopes of calling your mommy in
 Atlanta but soon realize your redbox was stolen from your pocket
 protecter by a group of bad bullies.  Casually you move over to the
 payphone beside yours and jot down its number.  If the number isn't
 on the phone you will have to call an 800 ANI to get it.  (A list
 of 800 ANI's is located at the end of this file.)   Removing Entropy's
 Paper Redbox from the pocket of your Guess jeans you note the 10-direct
 code for LDDS Metromedia.  You return to your original phone and dial:

               109990+ACN

      You will hear: "Welcome to LDDS Metromedia Operator Services,
 to place a collect call press 1 or to bill this call to a calling
 card enter the card # now.  If you need operator assitance press 0."

      In order to 3rd party bill you will have to go through an
 operator.  Don't be shy, they are friendly and have never heard of
 toll fraud in their lives.  Press 0 and when the operator comes on
 tell her you want to place a 3rd party billed call.  They will ask
 you for the # to bill the call so you give them the # of the phone next
 to you.  If you're calling from an actual payphone (as a opposed to
 a "standard" phone) they will put you on hold to verify the charges
 and you will hear it ringing in the background.  When the phone
 beside you rings (it will ring) answer it (dont even worry about
 changing your voice) and tell them you will accept the charges.

 Heres an example:

     1)   Dial 109990-516-751-2600
     2)   Press 0, and wait for the operator.
     3)   Operator? Yes I'd like to bill this call to my friend at
          411.  Yes thats right 411.  You won't bill to Sherry at
          directory asistance?  Would it help if i gave your her
          operator number?  (Try this from a COCOT, on occasion I
          have gotten away with billing to directory assistance,
          but I had to be tricky and give them a nunber like 617-
          555-1212.  Tricky, tricky eh?)   Well then just bill it
          to SUM-PAY-PHONE.
     4)   "Yes hello, oh yeah i talked to you a minute ago, yeah I
          just like to bill my calls to this payph...i mean my
          other line to save money... Yeah well it's a cellular
          phone...uh huh, yes I know there if no logic to that I
          just like to do it that way.... (If she persists.)
          ...Look lady, I am in a state of permanent psychosis, i'm
          very scared right now."
     5)   "y0y0y0 e-man, how ewe doing ?@!$ eye g0t ewe y0r
          warez!!@$"

      This works, I am told, because LDDS does not use the database of
 blocked numbers/payphones, or at least the one they have is
 horrendously small.  Bascially this means you can bill a call to ANYONE,
 even if they have specifically requested that no collect calls be allowed.
 And of course, (as you already know) you can 3rd party bill a call to your
 favorite payphone - legally.  Well at least _somewhat_ legally.
 Yes thats right, the nice operators and helpful customer service
 representatives concluded after hours of heated discussion that anything
 LDDS is used for _MUST_ be completely legal - otherwise you couldn't do it.

     ...And you've been sitting home weekends soldering crystals...

     Possible problems:

     P: The operator recognizes your voice.
     S: 1) Disguise your voice.
        2) tell her that was your brother on the other other line
           and that you are identical twins.
        3) You want to fuck her like an animal.

     P: The phone doesn't ring.
     S: Your at a phone that does not accept incoming calls.  This is
        a problem, this means it won't work.  If you ask the operator
        whats wrong she will tell you the number you are billing to is
        no longer in service and that no further information is available
        about that number.  There really isn't anything you can do about
        it when this happens.

     P: The number of the payphone isn't on the phone.
     S: Use an 800 ANI.  (See end of file)

       - Billing from a COCOT

      To quote 2600 Magazine, "Stupidity is an Olympic event in the
 COCOT world..."

      Countless articles have been written on the subject so I will assume
 the reader is generally familiar with COCOT's (Customer Owned Coin
 Operated Telephones.)  The main weakness behind such phones is that they
 were (and still are) subscriber loops.  Originally the label "payphone"
 was not associated with COCOT's and they could be abused in countless
 ways.  Now however, many phone companies have them "marked" as payphones,
 you can't bill to them...etc.  If you happen to be at a bank of two or more
 such phones you can easily dial the operator and 3rd party bill to the
 phone beside you.   Unfortunately there are all sorts of things COCOT's
 do to keep you from billing to the phones.  Many COCOT's don't have the
 number on them (use an 800 ANI) and in this area most COCOT's have
 messages for operators saying not to bill to that line.  This is however,
 hardly the most powerful thing one can do with such a phone:  when combined
 with (you guessed it!) LDDS Metromedia a COCOT becomes a dangerous weapon.
 In this case it is not so much the fault of the phone, but rather LDDS.

      LDDS Metromedia classifies lines as "standard," a typical
 residential line, and "payphone."   Almost _ALL_ COCOTS are
 classified by LDDS as "standard" phones.  Now to save time and
 money LDDS has implemented a particular policy having to do with
 3rd party billing: they don't verify 3rd party billed calls when
 made from a standard phone.  Thats right, you can pick up your home
 phone, dial 109990+617-GRENDEL and have the call billed to 202-456-
 1414.  They will do it without verification.  This is great if you
 want to go to prison when your number shows up on their bill at the
 end of the month.  I am unsure as to whether or not the billed party's
 number has to needs be valid.  If not a phreak would most likely get
 away with billing from home.  LDDS Metromedia will also 3rd Party Bill
 calls to the phone you are calling from.  (Use this as a last resort if
 you get them to bill a call otherwise.)

      You've probably realized by now that from a COCOT you should
 be able to bill a call to the phone you are standing at or any
 other random number that pops into your head.  Using LDDS to bill
 to a COCOT is even easier than boxing a call.   All you have to do
 is dial 109990+ACN, ask for the operator, and tell her to 3rd party
 bill the call to wherever you want.  Its that damn easy.

 [Note: Just before the release of this file LDDS began asking for
 full real (hah) names, they now keep them in a database... Apparently
 some of Entropy's friends used this billing method a bit much.  Just
 billshit the name, and if they tell you the party is not accepting 3rd
 calls then try again.  No biggie.]


 Part II: Fucking People Over
 ----------------------------

      Scenario:  Your friend just pissed you off.  Your friend is
                 going to wish he never pissed you off.

      Solution:  Go to your local COCOT (or someone else's
                 subscriber loop) and call 109990+310-516-1119 (deadline).
                 Ask the operator to bill the call to the assholes house.
                 When you here a loud click the deadline has answered
                 and you can leave the phone hanging there and just walk
                 away.  You might even want to put a little "Out of Order"
                 or "Do not hangup" sign on it, or rip the receiver right
                 off the phone.  Doing both seems to produce (on the average)
                 much higher bills.


 Part III: Collect Call Messaging and Operator Phun
 --------------------------------------------------

      This article is about practical methods of placing calls.  The
 information may or may not be new, and some sections may be considered
 somewwhat lame. But everything in this phile is easy to do...and it
 works.  With that in mind lets move on to Part III.

      Have you ever wanted to give someone a quick 15 second message
 without bothering with the usual billing shit?  Simply pick up your
 payphone, or home phone for that matter, smack 0+ACN and just
 select collect when you are given the option.  When it asks you for
 your name say something like, "Dont accept, the warez are on their
 way!!"  If you speak in a very distinct manner it may say it didn't
 get your name.  Try to slur 3 or 4 words together so it thinks of
 each slur as being a segment of your name.  The same goes for
 slurring too much, if it hears one long "blahahhhh" it will ask you
 to repeat.
 
      Amazingly this technique even works with live operators.  All
 you have to do is tell them your name is "Dewd 'I have the k0d3z'
 Michaels" or something to that effect.  Tell them its a secret
 thing between the two of you and if the operator doesnt say it they
 won't know its you.  In most cases the ops are required give them
 that name.

      And finally a list of k0d3z needed to do much of the shit in this
 phile.  Abuse them fully.  Its a great compact carry-it-everywhere list
 of ods and ends for the modern phreak.  Have phun.

                        Being Elite with NCSA Telnet
                    (common telnet used in computer labs)
                           written and tested by X


        College campus is a great place to live.  Especially if you have
ethernet in your rooms.  However if you don't have ethernet, don't be
discouraged.  Ethernet can be just as easily used from one of the greatly
convenient labs on campus, especially those that stay open 24 hours a day.

        Most campus machines that I have delt with have NCSA Telnet that
connects people to the internet.  TN3270 is the version that I have used
for years, and is the version from which I have tested my information.
However I have gotten these simple tricks to work on many other versions
including NCSA Telnet 2.5 for the Macintosh.

        First off you need to find the directory on the network containing
the telnet files.  Example: F:\APPS\TN3270\ or F:\PROGRAMS\TELNET\ or
whatever your administrators have decided to put it in.  Unless you have
supervisor access on the network, you won't be able to edit the necessary
files on the network, therefore you should copy all these telnet
files into a temp directory onto the C drive.  i.e. C:\TEMP. Next you need
to find the file called CONFIG.TEL.  This is the file in which all the
information is kept, i.e your designated i.p. address.  You need to edit
this file and since you now have your own version of telnet now on the C
drive, you won't hurt anything.. yet.  Here is a shortened clip of an example
of a CONFIG.TEL file, my comments will be preceded by "***" :



CONFIG.TEL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING:  The values for "myip" and "myname" are reserved for this
# Machine only.  Do not use these values with any other machine.


*** This is exactly what you want to do :)


myip=rarp



------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Rarp is a program which assigns this pc an i.p. random i.p. address
which currently isn't being used.  Some schools go ahead and assign each pc
with it's own personal i.p. address so they can keep track of what goes on
from where.  In that case it would look like this:


myip=135.2.45.23  (or whatever).


        Now for the good fun, you can replace myip with your own i.p. address
such as another pc, your local unix machine, or your admins pc :).  It is a
good thing to know beforehand what i.p. you want to take on.  It has to be
on the same domain as you of course.  i.e. 135.2.45.##

What happens now?  You know that admin that doesn't like you and always keeps
a close eye on you?  I wonder what would happen if you replace the myip to
his i.p. address and then trying to telnet somewhere.  Well, once you
lets change the i.p. and try.


myip=135.2.45.50


If his pc has a name (like it is in the nameserver) then you can telnet into
a system and it appears like you are coming from your admins office.  Watch


C:\TEMP\telnet hobbes.werd.edu


Connecting to 129.6.180.32, port TELNET (23)

Welcome to hobbes!

werd.. so now you appear to be telneting from your admins machine.  But what
happened to your admin so happily sitting at his terminal in front of his
computer?  Well, all his telnet sessions simply locked up and he probably
had to reboot.

        This is a great way to hide the fact that you are hacking from a
certain machine in the lab and it will throw off any investigation of who
was using what machine at what time.

        Now, you want to get rid of your admin?  Simple.  Try lots of feeble
hack attempts from your pc (now his address) on lots of elite .gov and .mil
sites.  Run lots of scripts and be sure to leave lots of logs.   The FBI
will most likely break down his door within the next week or so and haul him
off thinking he is some hack dude.

        As for others in the lab that you have a disliking for, i.e. warez
dude, mudder, or even your cpsc teacher down the hall.  Figure out what
i.p. they are using, change your CONFIG.TEL file to their i.p. and watch
them lose their connections.  Hopefully they were transfering a file or
even battling the evil dreaded 3 headed monster on the elite mud.

        It goes without saying that you should clean up your C:\TEMP\
directory as you do with anything, don't leave behind stuff that anyone
can use to link back to you.  Or else your admins will figure out what
is happening (not likely) and take care of the problem.

        which  I  find a refreshing change. I think that  when  this
        series  is  done, you'll have a better idea of how  we,  the
        hacking community,  are more of an asset -- and a threat  --
        to the world at large.

PART THE FIRST -- OSCINT OVERVIEW

              With  the  many advancements in information  retreival
        services,  there  is a growing threat of  information  being
        obtained  and  used for the wrong reasons. Such improvements
        include  electronic  CD-ROM databases  for  home  computers,
        academic data stored on computers on the Internet, and  even
        modern  archival  systems in  local libraries.  Unknowingly,
        however,   the  scientific  and  technical  (S&T)  community
        members  responsible for creating the Information  Explosion
        by  improving these archiveal services has also enabled  the
        public  to  rather easily obtain the data that  is  part  of
        classified  secrets. Consider nuclear weapons: the  American
        public  knows  they  exist, but their  creative  process  is
        classified  by  the government. Yet atomic  experiments  are
        conducted  daily  throughout  the  S&T  community  and  such
        experiments  --  with  results  --  are  recorded  and  made
        available to the public. Theoretically, then, a person could
        research,  locate parts for, and assemble an  atomic  weapon
        within  their  own home -- many files on h/p/a  BBSes  cover
        other  such  lethal  concoctions. Proliferation  of  nuclear
        weapons  is  a  proven  evil.  But  what  effect  does   the
        proliferation of information that leads to the proliferation
        of  such  weapons  take in the intelligence community?  What
        does  this  do to the definition of national security?  What
        does  this  mean for the intelligence community? What  about
        Big Business?
              For starters, national leaders (from the President  to
        the  thousand - dollar - suit - wearing  mongrels    running
        megamonopoly-like  corporations like  MicroSLOTH)  must  sit
        back  and  re-evaluate  their  fundamental  definitions   of
        national  security, intelligence, and corporate success.  In
        recent years, especially in the Clinton Administration,  the
        definition  of  national  security has  changed  to  include
        economic  issues as key factors that define  how  secure  or
        stable  a  nation is. Other transnational factors,  such  as
        global  warming,  national development, and the  environment
        are   also  crucial  in  shaping  American  foreign  policy.
        Information on all these topics exists in the public  domain
        and is not considered a government secret.
              The  end of the Cold War has caused a worldwide debate
        over many political definitions, especially what constitutes
        war,  peace, and the proper role of the nation-state in  the
        defense  of its citizens. Intelligence during the  Cold  War
        was  a  lengthy  process  that targeted  the  Soviet  Union.
        Through  the years, collected information has been  archived
        by not only intelligence agencies, but private organizations
        as  well,  such as LEXIS/NEXIS. Over forty years'  worth  of
        information  has been archived in libraries and  constantly-
        revised  electronic databases. Business information such  as
        stock   prices,   annual   reports,   mergers,   and   other
        information, is also available to whoever requests it.  This
        raw data is available to the public, academics, researchers,
        and  interested rival nations or corporations as well.  With
        the  advent of computer technology and the resulting ability
        to  conduct  rapid and global searches as  well  as  instant
        interpretation   and   presentation   of   collected   data,
        information  is becoming freely available. A  rival  nation,
        after   locating   relevant  data  on  his   target,   could
        incapacitate  military  and  civilian  command  systems   or
        disrupt urban power grids and the civil infrastructure as  a
        prelude  to  a  larger attack. A business  competitor  could
        learn  sensitive  material and trade secrets  from  a  rival
        corporation and improve its competive status on the  market.
        Information  is  readily available on any subject  from  any
        perspective.  With a little bit of research,  interpolation,
        and  brain-work  with  his findings, a  person  could  cause
        substantial  damage  to  a rival nation  or  corporation  by
        stealing  unsecured information that freely  exists  in  the
        public domain.
                    There   are   three   traditional   intelligence
        collection  methods. There is open source collection  (e.g.:
        FBIS,  Jane's Defence), the traditional and secretive HUMINT
        methods  using  spies and agents, and classified   technical
        surveillance (TECHINT). The latter are used to used to  gain
        access  to  Kremlin  safes, high-level  PLO  meetings,  OPEC
        negotiations,   and   other  areas   where   United   States
        representatives may not be welcome. The CIA  has  taken  the
        lead  in  such collection, and amassed a substantial archive
        of  information  from open sources to collate  with  reports
        gained through other secretive means to provide their "best-
        guess" intelligence estimates. Interestingly, however,  open
        source  collections  account for about 75%  of  all  foreign
        intelligence gathered, especially in such areas  as  foreign
        local politics, culture, quality of life, and public opinion
        of foreign leaders and policy. Secretly-gathered information
        usually  reveals  more  high-level  information  than   open
        sources,  however,  when the two are joined  and  accurately
        processed,  a  fairly accurate estimate should be  possible.
        Contrary  to  popular belief, the CIA places a  surprisingly
        high emphasis on OSCINT activities...and then classifies it.

        REALLY good stuff)

                     Open Source Collection INTelligence
                    Part 2 of Open Source Intelligence...
                        by firefly@dans.dorm.umd.edu
                       (and a college graduate too!!)

          The most prominent open-source advocate is Robert Steele,
     founder of Open Source Solutions, Inc., a year-old clearinghouse
     of unclassified information. After establishing a $20 million
     intelligence center for the U.S. Marines, Steele was shocked to
     discover that its interface with CIA classified databases could
     not provide the information that Marines wanted to know, such as
     the turning radius for ships in Brazilian ports or how much
     weight a bridge in Jordan could support. Much to his surprise,
     the information sought was easily found in the "open" market of
     commercial databases, academic sources, and computer networks.
     "Secrecy corrupts truth", he professes, much to the chagrin of
     intelligence specialists who agree that "if it's not secret, it's
     not worth knowing." Due to his solid standing in the intelligence
     community and  his promise of better information for one-tenth to
     one-hundredth of the cost of classified material, Steele is the
     subject of scrutiny of several influential policy makers and
     colleagues in the intelligence field. This not only publicizes
     Steele's organization, but also illuminates the cost-
     effectiveness and true potentials of open sources to both
     government and private consumers as well.
          Commercial ventures, such as OSS, although classified as
     Open Source Intelligence organizations, are primarily research
     organizations. A large percentage of time spent in OSINT-
     gathering and collection is done in libraries behind computer
     workstations on the many computer networks that span the globe
     with the single purpose of gathering information. In a decade of
     cutbacks in defense and intelligence funding, both OSINT-
     gathering activities and the resulting information are cost-
     effective methods of obtaining competitor information and data on
     foreign targets. The OSINT customer -- government or corporate --
     need not rent a satellite, hire agents, or spend mega-dollars on
     technical sensing equipment. They need only purchase a newly-
     updated report tailored exactly to their requirements, subscribe
     to a newspaper, or read a book or bound reference. In this age of
     cost-effectiveness being the paramount factor in authorizing
     government programs, the silent opinion seems to be one of "let
     some other guy do it" as a way to cut spending in not just
     intelligence operations, but throughout the government as well.
          Futurist Alvin Toffler wrote in Powershift that "information
     is a substitute for time, space, capital, and labor." With the
     new definition of national security including economic issues,
     OSINT is an indispensable asset in determining national security
     and national economic competitiveness. Toffler's "time-space-
     capital-labor" equates to a college economics textbook discussion
     of  "land-labor-capital" lessons in economic theory. Without
     these changes in fundamental political definitions, open sources
     and the advent of information exchange agreements will continue
     to be the unexplored and ignored intelligence medium of the
     future, as relatively little economic or trade data is kept
     secret by the government.
          Open source information is everywhere. From the daily
     newspaper to the national libraries, information overloads
     today's people. This information overload has resulted from
     computers and the many electronic archives of formerly-printed
     media. With a request through the Freedom of Information Act,
     citizens can peruse most government documents and reports legally
     and easily. Electronic databases on any subject are only a few
     keystrokes away and open to anyone with a personal computer and
     phone line. This wealth of information and raw data exists in the
     shadowy domain of cyberspace. As long as cyberspace remains
     without a formal structure, government, or hierarchy, anyone can
     access anything on-line. The use of computers has simplified the
     ability to analyze and interpret large amounts of data, including
     the ability to formulate estimates and predictions with limited
     or hypothetical data. Intelligence, has therefore moved into a
     new environment with a new set of tradecraft. Today's new
     intelligence tools are keyboards, modems, and databases used in
     the shadows of cyberspace.
          Computers are useful in storing and analyzing information,
     but are only one tool available to utilize open source
     information. Television, periodicals, books, and personal
     interviews can also lead to valuable intelligence information for
     the OSINT operative. In the business world, stock reports,
     phantom customers, newsletters, and professional symposiums are
     all ways of gaining open information about a competitor or rival
     market. No piece of information is unimportant in OSINT
     operations. PSYTEP's Paul Caldwell remarked that there are "new
     modes of intelligence-gathering being born everyday," including
     TRASHINT (garbage-picking) and RECYCL-INT, (reading discarded
     papers that are sent to a recycling company for disposal before
     they are recycled). In essence, OSINT includes these modes of
     inquiry as well as any investigative technique used by a private
     investigator.
          Some of these secret operations, such as RECYCL-INT, are
     considered "gray-colored", since they are not quite ethical or
     orthodox, however, they are legal.  Many times intelligence is
     gathered through overt -- albeit unorthodox -- methods, much to
     the embarrassment of the target company or individual. Placing a
     person in a position to gain information is relatively easy,
     especially in the business world. An operative posing as a alley
     vagrant could ruffle through a commercial garbage dumpster, read
     discarded papers, and bring "interesting" data back to the
     investigating office for incorporation into a larger report on a
     rival's business strategy for the next decade. Far-fetched?
     PSYTEP collection specialist Ronald Coetzee says that the "sky's
     the limit on collections...you must be prepared to gather any bit
     of info you see as relevant for your case."
