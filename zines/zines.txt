* PLEASE NOTE: If more than one month has passed since the last
* update, this list is probably out of date.  See below for
* instructions on how to obtain a current list.

This is a summary of 287 electronically-accessible zines 
-- what they are, who publishes them, and where you can find them. 

If you have access to a World Wide Web browser like Mosaic or
Netscape, a much more readable and navigatable list can be 
found at the URL:

  http://www.ora.com:8080/johnl/e-zine-list/

This text version is automatically posted every 3 weeks to the 
following newsgroups: alt.zines, alt.etext, misc.writing, rec.mag, 
alt.internet.services, alt.answers, misc.answers, rec.answers, 
and news.answers.

You can get it via anonymous FTP from ftp.etext.org in the 
"/pub/Zines" directory, as "e-zine-list".  Gopher users can find 
it at gopher.etext.org under the "Zines" menu, as "e-zine-list".

If you don't have access to any of these archives, you can ask
me to send you a recent copy.

For those of you not acquainted with the zine world, "zine" is short
for either "fanzine" or "magazine," depending on your point of view.
Zines are generally produced by one person or a small group of people,
done often for fun or personal reasons, and tend to be irreverent,
bizarre, and/or esoteric. Zines are not "mainstream" publications --
they generally do not contain advertisements (except, sometimes,
advertisements for other zines), are not targeted towards a mass
audience, and are generally not produced to make a profit.

If you publish an e-zine, or know someone who does, drop me an 
email message, and I'll send you instructions on how to get an 
entry on the list.

If you have any comments, additions, deletions, or changes to this 
list, please email them to johnl@ora.com.

The "Bobby" Chronicles

 "Tales and commentary about the lives of Generation X types trapped
  in rural New Brunswick, Canada. More often than not, the zine will
  be short, mostly factual, and not terribly serious. "Bobby" has
  several meanings, including "redneck". This zine is -not- written
  from a redneck's point of view. A stop on one of the dirt roads
  feeding into the info highway."

Breakaway

 "As the last terror-regimes in eastern Europe stumbled down, it once
  again became possible for those who never accepted these regimes as
  marxist to discuss marxist theory freely. Breakaway is meant to
  support this debate about modern marxism. We will write about
  marxist theory and it's consequences as well as publish works of
  fiction falling into the bag of 'proletarian literature.' We greatly
  encourage our readers to submit articles covering their views,
  dreams and hopes for the future, as well thorough argumentation on a
  special topic of marxist ideology, or poems and short-stories."

Cropduster

 "Cropduster (est. 1992) appears periodically as a reaction to the
  kind of society that some of us live in. It is a knee-jerk response
  to the fact that our world produces cultural under-achievers...
  Cropduster has so far produced various reviews and critiques of some
  of the lesser known aspects of people and places that teeter-totter
  on barely breaking even. The zine is an overseer of this as well as
  a product of it, because the thing itself exhibits too many of the
  traits it condemns: Lack of rigor, unfair attacks, vendettas,
  revisionism, stubbornness, spelling mistakes, and vulgarity. What
  else can you expect from people who grew up in trailer parks and
  live on Kraft Dinner?"

dreamboy!

 "The monthly, spine-tingling adventure chronicling about two-weeks
  worth of slumber-induced emissions. Travel with Chris, hero of the
  socially awkward, as he traverses television-like terrain, conquers
  the weak and less fortunate, and embarrasses everyone he knows.
  Witness with intricate detail the never-before-seen interrelations
  of Saddam Hussein and bowel movements. The National Hockey League
  and Asian girls. Anton Szandor LaVey and the Fonz. A charming
  adventure, making good use of Yul Brenner, scabs, smegma, and cheese
  pizza. It's like a TV Guide to the subconscious. You enjoy reading
  the listings...and can't help but wonder just who the hell is
  broadcasting."

  nibblets about the artists... it's fun and serious, mundane and

Factsheet Five / Factsheet Five - Electric

 "Factsheet Five is the closest thing to a central clearinghouse of
  data about the anarchic, decentralized world of self-published
  magazines known as zines. We review over 1,200 zines each quarter
  (Yow!) in the print version. The reviews are uploaded to the Net and
  combined with reviews from a variety of other publications - such as
  Bypass, Second Guess, Fucktooth - and random people around the Net.
  We encourage *you* to read zines, produce a zine, and send us your
  reviews of zines. The files that comprise F5-E are divided into
  various categories (Punk, Grrrlz, Politics, Fringe, Queer, Sex,
  etc.) and an issue will be over 2 megabytes in size. Each review
  gives you the ordering information for the zine as well as our
  opinion of the publication."

             Note: Please send zines to just one address. All reviews

FUNHOUSE! -- The cyberzine of degenerate pop culture

 "Dedicated to whatever happens to be on my mind at the time I'm
  writing. The focus will tend to be on those aspects of our
  fun-filled world which aren't given the attention of the bland
  traditional media, or which have been woefully misinterpreted or
  misdiagnosed by the same. FUNHOUSE! is basically a happy place, and
  thus the only real criteria I will try to meet is to refrain from
  rants, personal attacks, and flames -- and thus FUNHOUSE! is an
  apolitical place. Offbeat films, music, literature, and experiences
  are largely covered, with the one stipulation that articles are
  attempted to be detailed and well documented, although this is no
  guarantee of completeness or correctness, so that the interested
  reader may further pursue something which may spark her interest."

Hi-Rez: Electronic Journal for CyberBeatniks

 "we BURN in sticky floored 2 in the morning all night coffee houses
  ripe with APOCALYPTIC VISIONS and we rave at dawn in crumbling
  1700's farmhouses. we sizzle along the asphalt veins lacing the skin
  of the nation together in white high-finned cadillacs driven by
  madmen. we modulate the very aether itself with ecstatic rf
  emanations from beat loft radio studios. We are the
  cyber-beatniks...the DANGEROUS NEW ARTISTS..... the TECHNICIANS OF
  ECSTASY and we are all ENMESHED IN THE NET stuck together by the
  sweet and sticky text characters that form the dimensional glue of
  this here cyberspace......... we do not FIT the stereotypes and
  posings of pop subcultures: we are the cyber-beatniks and we are
  ALONE in our art theater magic alchemy yet we are TOGETHER here. A
  loose fuzzy grouping of mad artists and eccentrics who choose to
  SURF THE GREAT THUNDERING ROLLING TUBES OF AWESOME TECHNOLOGY rather
  than be consumed by the "post-apocalyptic angst" of it . A group of
  vision-seeking edge dwellers who are equally capable of activating
  deep woods ancient genetic codices with shaman rattle and drum!! we
  are the cyber-beatniks...CYBER-BEATS! and _HI-REZ_ is a journal for
  us of ideas, lives.....VISIONS"

  network of novel-length literature. As it is not a paper publication
  we do not want to approach it as such; instead of a product, it is a
  process. It changes and shifts over time, a labyrinth in progress.
  Not everything is accessible from the front/homepage. Individual
  writers may grow their works, others may dissappear."

TimeWasters Online Magazine

 "TOM is in Dutch and is intended for all Dutch-reading people on the
  Internet. The topics are often computer-related, but we also have
  regulars like a book review, a music column and a recipe section.
  The magazine is based in Eindhoven, because it has grown from a
  group of students of Eindhoven University of Technology called the
  Incredible TimeWasters (since 1989)."

  American politics and society. WebRunner publishes between 5-10
  essays of 500-1,000 words each. We encourage submissions. Anonymity
  is ok. We have no ideological cast, nor do we have a legislative
  agenda. Our focus is on opinion and insight. Paid notices accepted.
  We have a co-op publishing program. Also, a growing reference list
  of hundreds of advocacy groups. No mail subscriptions."

  community of tool-users who share information with one another. The
  ideas we make accessible have not often been found in university
